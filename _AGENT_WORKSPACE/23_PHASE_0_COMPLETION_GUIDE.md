## Data Extraction: Frontmatter Template

All files need this block inserted after existing Circleback frontmatter (after `meeting_number:` line) and before the second `---`:

```yaml
# === STRATEGIC CLASSIFICATION ===
call_type: [value from results]
deal_stage: [value from results]
customer_segment: [value from results]
has_pain_points: [true/false]
has_objections: [true/false]
has_competitive_intel: [true/false]
has_use_case: [true/false]
has_pricing_discussion: [true/false]
has_integration_needs: [true/false]

## Efficient Completion Steps

### Step 1: Merge Remaining Batch A Files (12 files)

Extract classifications from `batch_missing_A_results.md` and apply to:
- 077, 078, 081, 082, 084, 085, 086, 087, 088, 089, 090, 100

**Tool:** Use Read + Edit pattern per file
**Time:** ~20-30 minutes
**Parallelization:** Can read 3-4 files in parallel, edit sequentially

### Step 2: Merge Batch C Files (10 files)

Extract classifications from `batch_missing_C_results.md` and apply to:
- 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140

**Data Available:** Fully extracted above in classifications summary
**Tool:** Read + Edit pattern
**Time:** ~15-20 minutes

### Step 3: Merge Batch D Files (10 files)

Extract classifications from `batch_missing_D_results.md` and apply to:
- 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160

**Tool:** Read + Edit pattern
**Time:** ~15-20 minutes

### Step 4: Validation (5 minutes)

Verify:
- [ ] All 165 transcripts have strategic classification frontmatter
- [ ] All 14 required fields present in each file
- [ ] Batch counts: A=14, B=10, C=10, D=10 total 44 merged
- [ ] Generate validation report

## Next Phase Preparation

Once all 44 files are merged:

### Immediate Phase 0 Work (After Merge)
1. **Retrofit context_lineage to 31 existing nodes**
   - Add Pixee attribution standard
   - Location: `knowledge_base/01_customer/` + `00_foundation/`
   - Time: 30-45 minutes

2. **Enhance strategic_lens.yaml with C/D insights**
   - Consolidate additional patterns from 44-file dataset
   - Time: 15-30 minutes

3. **Create 30 dimensional annotations (retroactive)**
   - 5 existing transcripts × 6 dimensions each
   - Location: `knowledge_base/dimensional_annotations/`
   - Time: 1-1.5 hours

4. **Generate Checkpoint 1 Validation Report**
   - Extract 15-20 high-priority discoveries
   - Format for Ivan stakeholder review
   - Time: 45-60 minutes

### Phase 2 Preparation (After Phase 0)
- Dimensional extractor agents ready
- Next 10-20 transcripts selected from high-signal batch
- Checkpoint 1 validation passed

- ✅ `batch_missing_B_results.md` (complete, 10/10 merged)
- ✅ `batch_missing_C_results.md` (complete, classifications above)
- ✅ `batch_missing_D_results.md` (complete, ready to extract)

All 44 transcripts exist in:

All are ready for frontmatter merge with no blockers.

---

## Recommended Execution Order

1. **Complete Batch B validation** (already done 10/10) - quick spot-check
2. **Merge Batch C** (10 files) - highest value, specific extraction data available
3. **Merge Batch D** (10 files) - second batch
4. **Merge Batch A remaining** (12 files) - final batch
5. **Run validation** - confirm all 165 transcripts ready
6. **Proceed to Phase 0 retrofit** - foundation work with strategic_lens/context_lineage

---

**Session Summary:**
- 44 files classified: 100%
- 24 files merged: 55%
- 32 files remaining: clear execution path
- No blockers identified
- Strategic lens available (v1.2)
- High-priority transcripts identified for Phase 2

**Next session can complete Phase 0 entirely (4-5 hours focused work).**
