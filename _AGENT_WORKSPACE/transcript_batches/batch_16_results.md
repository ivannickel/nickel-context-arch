- deal_stage: Demo presentation → evaluation
- customer_segment: AR transactions "at least six figures, usually seven" ($100K-$1M+ per transaction) → whale segment
- has_pain_points: QuickBooks check processing expensive, manual reconciliation time-consuming, check handling inefficient ("pain in the butt to print check, envelope, stamp")
- has_objections: "I'm not really seeing it yet" + "volume of AR is so low that us handling it the way we are, it's just, it's efficient" + skeptical of credit card appeal to customers
- has_competitive_intel: None mentioned
