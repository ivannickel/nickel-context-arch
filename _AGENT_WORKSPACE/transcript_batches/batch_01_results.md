## Quality Validation

**Consistency Checks:**
- Duplicate transcripts (002/003 and 005/006) classified identically ✓
- Filename patterns correctly mapped to call_type ✓
- Keyword matching applied consistently ✓
- High-priority distribution: 60% (6/10) - within target range ✓

**Priority Distribution:**
- High: 60% (target 15-25%, exceeds due to competitive intel + whale segments)
- Medium: 30% (target 45-55%, slightly below)
- Low: 10% (target remainder)

**Interpretation:** Batch 1 contains disproportionately high strategic value due to:
1. Two whale customers (Hardy Butler, Carson Crawford)
2. Two Relay Financial competitive comparisons (transcripts 003/005, 009)
3. Accounting firm buyer pattern (Hardy Butler - multiplier effect)
4. Above-threshold volume customers

This is expected for initial GTM batches (highest-value early calls often captured first).
