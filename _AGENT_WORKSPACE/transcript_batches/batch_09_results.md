## Distribution Analysis

| Priority | Count | % | Expected |
|----------|-------|---|----------|
| High | 2 | 20% | 15-25% |
| Medium | 6 | 60% | 45-55% |
| Low | 2 | 20% | 20-30% |

**Assessment:** Distribution matches expected ranges. High priority captures discovery/demo calls with competitive intel or pain points. Medium priority captures active customer reviews and kickoffs with use cases. Low priority reserved for operational/follow-up calls without strategic signals.

---

## Strategic Signal Frequency

| Signal | Count | % |
|--------|-------|---|
| has_use_case | 8 | 80% |
| has_integration_needs | 7 | 70% |
| has_pain_points | 4 | 40% |
| has_pricing_discussion | 3 | 30% |
| has_competitive_intel | 2 | 20% |
| has_objections | 1 | 10% |

**Assessment:** 90% of transcripts contain ≥1 strategic signal (exceeds 70% target). Use cases are universal. Integration needs very common. Competitive intel appears mainly in whale/high-value segments.

---

## Notable Patterns

1. **Whale Dominance:** 4 of 10 classified as whale segment (40%), all with above-threshold transactions
2. **Construction/Healthcare Concentration:** 7 of 10 in construction or professional_services
3. **High Integration Needs:** 7 of 10 require QuickBooks or API integration
4. **Use Case Prevalence:** 8 of 10 have clear use cases (workflows well-defined)
5. **Competitive Pressure:** Melio appears in 2 transcripts (087, 084) as primary competitor
6. **Segmentation Clarity:** Clear division between whale (big transaction volume) and shrimp/fish (small)
