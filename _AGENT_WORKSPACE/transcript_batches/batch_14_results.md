- has_objections: True - complex technical requirements (ISO structure, FBO account, delayed holding funds, risk returns)
- has_competitive_intel: Currently using Qlik by Pay Compass (39 cents/transaction) and Nuvve, seeking additional options due to Nuvve support degradation
- has_use_case: AP processor for seller finance contracts, needs custom integration for customer's platform
- has_pricing_discussion: Current rates context (39 cents + monthly fee, 2.9% + 30 cents credit card), discussing potential Nickel rates
- has_integration_needs: Custom API/webhook integration required (not out-of-box product)
- primary_industry: professional_services (payment processing/seller finance platform)
- transaction_volume: "1.2-1.7 million" monthly → above_threshold
