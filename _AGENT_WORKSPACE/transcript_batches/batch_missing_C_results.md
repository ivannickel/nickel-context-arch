- **has_use_case:** Discusses franchisee payment management, recurring payments, multi-location payment splitting, compliance requirements → true
- **has_pricing_discussion:** Extensive: master account ($35/month), Nickel Plus vs Core, transaction limits, commission structure (30% bar, 30% system, 40% nonprofits) → true
- **transaction_volume:** Discusses large volume with thousands of nonprofits, $13,000 average transactions, potential 80-90M annually → above_threshold
- **ar_vs_ap:** Discusses both franchisee payments (AR) and vendor/nonprofit payouts (AP) → both

customer_segment: unknown
has_pain_points: false
has_objections: true
has_competitive_intel: false
has_use_case: false
has_pricing_discussion: false
has_integration_needs: true
primary_industry: professional_services
transaction_volume: unknown
ar_vs_ap: ap_only
processed: false
dimensional_extracted: false
extraction_priority: low
```

**RATIONALE:**
- **call_type:** Filename contains "x-nickel" but content is initial exploratory call addressing compliance/technical blockers, not a demo. Jacob attempts to understand requirements and resolve EIN/beneficial ownership issues → discovery
- **deal_stage:** First substantive conversation, qualification phase → discovery
- **has_objections:** Multiple stated concerns: "EIN is theirs", nonprofit structure complications, beneficial ownership legal risks, "If we can't [solve this], it's mooted" → true
- **has_use_case:** Limited use case discussion. Primary focus is compliance blocker. Matt states: "We're not going to accept payments through nickel. We just use it to do outbound ACHs from our bank account" → use case is narrow (AP only)
- **has_pricing_discussion:** No pricing discussion. Matt mentions "$3,000 transactions", "couple thousand some months", mentions "free ACH" but no Nickel pricing exploration → false
- **has_integration_needs:** "Link QuickBooks", "ACH processing" mentioned → true
- **transaction_volume:** "$3,000" total monthly, "couple thousand some months" → sub_threshold (well under $2M)
- **ar_vs_ap:** "outbound ACHs", "bill pay", "vendor reimbursements" - AP only → ap_only
- **primary_industry:** Nonprofit organization (Sierra Club chapter) → professional_services (fits service org category)
- **extraction_priority:** Discovery call but primary signal is blocking issue (compliance), minimal use case, low transaction volume, unknown segment = LOW

- **ar_vs_ap:** Both ACH and credit card mentioned, platform processor for multiple customers → both
- **extraction_priority:** General call, technical complexity mismatch ("we might not be the best solution"), requires CEO approval, custom build (2-3 week process), unclear fit → LOW

## Consistency Notes

**Duplicate/Related Transcripts:**
- No exact duplicates in this batch
- Ellen Moser (135) is manufacturing buyer, strong AR/AP use case, skeptical but engaged
- Robert Stern (139) is storage/professional services, whale segment, strong competitive intel

**Edge Cases Handled:**
- Transcript 134 (Mitesh Bhagat): No-show call - classified as general with all false signals and low priority
- Transcript 140 (Kayla Rakes): Custom integration request (not standard product fit) - correctly classified as general, low priority

**Classification Consistency:**
- All "and-colton" / "and-jacob" patterns reviewed: Applied discovery only when content supported initial qualification focus (132 only)
- All demo filenames validated against content: confirmed each had product walkthrough
- Review filename (138) correctly identified as active deal stage with hesitation signals
