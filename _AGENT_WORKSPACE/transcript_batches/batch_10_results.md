## Notes

**High-Priority Insights:**

1. **Shannon Rayman (092):** Strongest demo candidate. Security-conscious bookkeeper escaping QBO vulnerability. Melio competitive threat. Fast-track opportunity with potential referral network to other QBO customers.

2. **VIP Software (099):** Enterprise partnership opportunity. High risk/high reward. Requires API development and pricing alignment. 25 immediate clients, 350+ ecosystem potential. Regulatory structure concerns need resolution.

**Medium-Priority Trends:**

3. **Aurelie Nguyen (093):** Tax firm with high-volume ($300-400K/month) coaching business client. Good fit, no objections. Potential for multi-client expansion.

4. **GRA Services (096):** Active, happy customer. Testing both AP and AR sides. Good word-of-mouth referral potential (Moon Chemical mention).

5. **Bobbie Smith (097):** Dental practices, HIPAA concerns, good volume ($150-250K). Needs custom configuration discussion but viable.

**Low-Priority/Monitor:**

6. **SB Rotary (098):** High friction/frustration. Integration issues may cause churn. Needs proactive support.

7. **1800 Water Damage (095):** Just onboarding, will be active. Follow up in 1-2 weeks.
