# Nickel Sales Transcript Analysis Plan

**Objective:** Extract actionable GTM intelligence from 165 sales call transcripts (788K words) using methodical breadth-first → depth-first search patterns.

**Approach:** Oil drilling methodology - surface survey to identify high-signal zones, then deep extraction.

---

## Part 2: Search Hypotheses

### Hypothesis 1: Pricing Objections Block Conversions
**Question:** What pricing objections surface most frequently and at what deal stages?

**Why It Matters:** If card processing fees (2.9%) are a common blocker, need to reframe value prop around ACH savings and total cost of ownership.

**Search Signal:** Mentions of "expensive," "fee," "rate," "cost," "cheaper," competitor pricing

---

### Hypothesis 2: QuickBooks Integration Is Key Distribution Lever
**Question:** How often does QB integration come up as decision factor vs. blocker?

**Why It Matters:** If QB integration is consistently mentioned as reason to choose Nickel, double down on QB marketplace SEO and QB accountant partnerships.

**Search Signal:** "QuickBooks," "QBO," "accounting software," "integration," "sync"

---

### Hypothesis 3: Volume Thresholds Disqualify Many Prospects
**Question:** What % of deals fail because prospect doesn't meet volume requirements for discounted rates?

**Why It Matters:** From transcripts, saw $2M+ credit card volume needed for rate negotiation. May need mid-market tier or alternative qualification criteria.

**Search Signal:** "volume," "threshold," "minimum," "$2 million," "not enough spend," "too small"

---

### Hypothesis 4: Construction Vertical Shows Different Buying Pattern
**Question:** Do construction customers have unique objections, use cases, or decision criteria vs. other verticals?

**Why It Matters:** If construction has distinct pattern, justifies vertical-specific marketing, sales playbooks, and product features.

**Search Signal:** "construction," "contractor," "GC," "subcontractor," "Procore," "project," "job costing"

---

### Hypothesis 5: AR Adoption Drives AP Monetization
**Question:** Do customers who adopt accounts receivable (AR) features have higher lifetime value than AP-only customers?

**Why It Matters:** If AR drives monetization, sales should push AR adoption even if prospect initially only wants AP.

**Search Signal:** "accounts receivable," "invoicing," "AR," "get paid," "send invoices," cross-sell patterns

---

### Hypothesis 6: Competitor Comparisons Focus on Bill.com and QuickBooks Pay
**Question:** Which competitors are most frequently mentioned and how is Nickel positioned against them?

**Why It Matters:** Informs competitive battlecards and differentiation messaging.

**Search Signal:** "Bill.com," "QuickBooks Pay," "Melio," competitor names, "currently using," "switching from"

---

### Hypothesis 7: Feature Gaps Cause Deal Loss
**Question:** What features do prospects request that Nickel doesn't have?

**Why It Matters:** Product roadmap prioritization and "coming soon" vs. "not a fit" disqualification.

**Search Signal:** "don't have," "missing," "need," "wish you had," "feature request," "deal breaker"

---

### Hypothesis 8: Net Terms / Credit Features Drive Pro Tier Upgrades
**Question:** How often do net terms and credit vetting features come up in conversations, and do they correlate with Pro tier interest?

**Why It Matters:** If net terms is a killer feature, should be more prominent in marketing and sales discovery.

**Search Signal:** "net 30," "net 60," "net terms," "trade credit," "credit application," "payment terms"

---

### Hypothesis 9: Onboarding Complexity Creates Churn Risk
**Question:** Do customers express confusion or friction during onboarding/implementation?

**Why It Matters:** High onboarding friction = churn risk. May need enhanced CS resources or product simplification.

**Search Signal:** "complicated," "confusing," "setup," "onboard," "how do I," "need help with"

---

### Hypothesis 10: Sales Rep Effectiveness Varies by Approach
**Question:** Do different sales reps have different conversion patterns based on discovery depth, objection handling, or demo flow?

**Why It Matters:** Identify best practices from top performers to codify in sales playbook.

**Search Signal:** Compare call structures, question patterns, objection handling across reps

---

## Part 3: Drilling Plan (Breadth → Depth)

### Phase 1: Surface Survey (Breadth-First)

Output: Industry distribution and industry-specific language patterns
```

#### F. Deal Stage Indicator Extraction
```
Search patterns:

- Classify: Must-have vs. nice-to-have
- Track: Frequency of same request across customers

Output: Product roadmap prioritization data
```

#### C. Integration Pain Point Extraction
```

  echo "=== Searching: $pattern ==="
  grep -i "$pattern" *.md | wc -l
done
```

**Output:** CSV with pattern frequencies and file distributions
