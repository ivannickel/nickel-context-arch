# Nickel Sales Playbook: Pricing Objections
**Based on analysis of 165 sales calls | Updated: 2025-10-24**

Quick-reference guide for handling pricing objections in Nickel sales conversations.

---

## Quick Stats to Know

- **57% of calls** contain pricing objections
- **Only 1 discount approved** in 165 calls (2.9% â†’ 2.8% at $2M+ volume)
- **$2M credit card volume required** for rate negotiation with AR
- **$5-6M required** for AP-only rate negotiations
- **Free ACH resonates in 86%** of conversations when framed correctly
- **71% of prospects** fall below volume thresholds

---

## The 5 Most Common Pricing Objections

### 1. "Your rate is too expensive"
### 2. "I don't have $2M volume"
### 3. "Can you negotiate on price?"
### 4. "Competitor X is cheaper"
### 5. "I need this for small clients"

---

## OBJECTION #1: "Your rate is too expensive"

**What they're really saying:** "I'm comparing your 2.9% to something else"

**Your Response Framework:**

**STEP 1 - Anchor to Free ACH**
```
"I understand price sensitivity. Let me frame our complete value:
100% of our customers get unlimited free ACH - zero cost,
zero limits. Most of your customers likely prefer ACH anyway.
The 2.9% only applies when YOUR customer chooses to pay by
credit card."
```

**STEP 2 - Reframe Cost Ownership**
```
"Here's what makes Nickel different: You control 100% of how
that 2.9% fee is handled. You can pass the full fee to your
customer (compliant in all 50 states), split it 50/50, or
eat it entirely. With QuickBooks Pay or Bill.com, you don't
get that control."
```

**STEP 3 - Competitive Reality Check**
```
"Competitor pricing reality:
- Bill.com: 2.9% + monthly fees + poor support
- Melio: Used to be free, now 1% ACH + 2.9% cards
- ZAGO: 4% cards + $3.95 per ACH
- QB Pay: 2.9% + they jacked ACH to 1-2%

You're getting the industry-standard card rate PLUS free
unlimited ACH, which no one else offers."
```

**When This Works:**
- Customer is comparing surface-level rates
- They haven't calculated ACH savings
- Coming from expensive incumbent (Bill.com, Melio post-pricing change)

**When It Doesn't Work:**
- Customer has negotiated 2.5% or lower with current provider
- Enterprise customers with aggressive procurement teams
- Fortune 500 suppliers facing margin compression

**Real Example (Brandon Rogers, Catalyst Architecture):**
> "We were certainly drawn to the idea of having just pay a monthly fee.
> If clients wanna pay the 3% on their own to a credit card, they can.
> Otherwise, free ACH transfer is really what we're here for."
**Result:** Closed deal - customer understood value equation

---

## OBJECTION #2: "I don't have $2M volume"

**What they're really saying:** "I heard you give discounts but I don't qualify"

**Your Response Framework:**

**STEP 1 - Honest Qualification**
```
"I appreciate you asking directly. Here's our transparent policy:

For rate discounts, we need:
- $2M+ annual credit card volume
- PLUS commitment to use both AP and AR
- OR $5-6M if AP-only

The reality: We've approved ONE rate discount in the last
6 months (2.9% to 2.8%). It's not common because our margins
are already thin."
```

**STEP 2 - Redirect to Value, Not Discount**
```
"But here's the thing - most customers at your volume range
($500K-$1.5M) actually save MORE money with Nickel than they
would with a discounted rate elsewhere. Why?

1. Free ACH eliminates $X,XXX in annual fees
2. You avoid monthly platform fees ($50-200/mo elsewhere)
3. Our G2 rating (4.9/5) means less support headaches
4. QuickBooks integration = real-time sync (no export/import)"
```

**STEP 3 - Create Alternative Path**
```
"What I recommend: Start on our Plus plan ($35-45/month).
Lock in the free ACH benefit, test with your first 10 invoices.
If you hit $2M+ volume in the next 12 months, we revisit
pricing. But honestly, most customers at your volume range
are thrilled with standard pricing once they see total cost
of ownership."
```

**When This Works:**
- $500K-$1.5M annual volume customers
- Reasonable expectations (not demanding 2% like Fortune 500)
- Willing to start with free/Plus and grow into volume

**When It Doesn't Work:**
- They NEED the discount to hit their margin targets
- Procurement team has mandate to get X% discount
- They have a cheaper incumbent at volume (rare but happens)

**Real Example (Erik Meza, NLT LLC - FAILED):**
> Customer: $800K annual spend
>
> Colton: "Unfortunately, that 800,000 in credit card spend isn't
> really enough to hit that threshold where we're able to make money
> back from it because we provide quite a set of generous features
> for free."
>
> Erik: "For larger ones [Fortune 500 customers] that we deal with,
> I would say it's a long shot. I would hate to lie to you and tell
> you yes."

**Result:** Deal deferred - couldn't justify rate reduction, customer couldn't bring AR volume

**Key Lesson:** Don't create false hope. Qualify hard, redirect to value story.

---

## OBJECTION #3: "Can you negotiate on price?"

**What they're really saying:** "I'm trained to always ask for a discount"

**Your Response Framework:**

**STEP 1 - Acknowledge the Ask**
```
"I respect that you're asking - it's smart business. Let me
give you the honest answer on where we have flexibility."
```

**STEP 2 - Explain the Economics**
```
"Nickel operates differently than traditional payment processors:

1. We make ZERO money on ACH (it costs us $1+ per transaction)
2. Free ACH is our customer acquisition strategy
3. Card processing at 2.9% is how we stay in business
4. We're already cash-flow positive and profitable

If we discount the 2.9%, we're subsidizing your business
with investor money. That's the Melio/Bill.com playbook -
hook customers with free, then jack up prices. We don't
operate that way."
```

**STEP 3 - Define the Volume Bar**
```
"Here's where we CAN negotiate:

If you're processing $2M+ annually in credit cards AND
you commit to using our AR features, we can have a conversation.
The one discount I've seen approved in my territory went from
2.9% to 2.8% - a 10 basis point reduction.

That's the bar. If you're doing $500K, $800K, even $1.5M -
we're not there yet. But if you think you can hit $2M+ in
the next 12 months, let's build a path to revisit pricing
at that milestone."
```

**When This Works:**
- Customer is testing negotiation appetite (common in B2B)
- They respect transparency and move on
- They're close to volume threshold ($1.5M+)

**When It Doesn't Work:**
- Customer has inflexible procurement mandate
- They're comparing to locked-in incumbent rates
- The discount is necessary for deal math to work

**Real Example (VIP Software - SUCCESS):**
> Michael Battis: "Roughly one or two bucks per transaction"
>
> Ray Fu: "Our cost basis alone is going to be more than a dollar
> per transaction. If we are not finding additional avenues to
> generate transaction-based income, it's very hard for us to
> make that work as a business."
>
> **Negotiated result:** $1.20/ACH for 50,000 monthly minimum +
> $5K implementation fee + 12-month commitment

**Result:** Only successful negotiation in corpus - required enterprise volume + strategic partnership value

**Key Lesson:** Negotiate when there's real volume and partnership value, not just because they asked.

---

## OBJECTION #4: "Competitor X is cheaper"

**What they're really saying:** "I found someone offering lower rates"

**Your Response Framework:**

**STEP 1 - Get Specifics**
```
"I want to make sure we're comparing apples to apples.
Can you help me understand:

1. What's their credit card rate?
2. What do they charge for ACH?
3. Are there monthly platform fees?
4. What's the catch - do they require AR usage, minimums, etc.?"
```

**STEP 2 - Competitive Breakdowns**

**VS. BILL.COM**
```
"Bill.com's pricing seems competitive until you factor in:
- Monthly platform fees ($50-200/mo depending on tier)
- ACH fees (they moved from free to 1%+ recently)
- Known for poor/slow customer support (no phone line)
- System reliability issues (customers report payroll failures)

If you're processing $50K/month, Bill.com's 1% ACH = $6,000
annually. Nickel's free ACH saves you that entire amount.
Even if they charge 2.7% cards vs. our 2.9%, you're still
ahead with Nickel."
```

**VS. MELIO**
```
"Melio burned a lot of customers. They started free, built a
huge user base, then pivoted to charging 1% on ACH overnight.
Customers went from $0 to thousands per year in fees.

They're cheaper right now, but can you trust them not to do
it again? We're profitable, we're transparent about our business
model, and free ACH is our permanent strategy. G2 rating:
Nickel 4.9/5 vs. Melio's lower ratings."
```

**VS. QUICKBOOKS PAY**
```
"QuickBooks did the exact same thing as Melio - offered free
ACH, then flipped to charging. Customers are frustrated.

Yes, they integrate natively with QB, but so do we - and our
sync is real-time (1 second delay) vs. their batch processing.
Plus, you're not locked into the Intuit ecosystem pricing
increases."
```

**VS. STRIPE / HIGH-VOLUME PROCESSORS**
```
"Stripe's interchange+ model can be cheaper IF you're doing
$5M+ monthly and have negotiating power. But:
- No free ACH (they charge 0.8% per ACH, $5 cap)
- No invoicing features (you need another tool)
- No AR automation
- Developer-focused, not business user friendly

Nickel is purpose-built for B2B invoicing and payments. You
get a complete solution, not just payment processing."
```

**STEP 3 - Total Cost of Ownership**
```
"Let's calculate your true cost over 12 months:

Competitor X:
- Card rate: 2.7% x $500K = $13,500
- ACH fees: 1% x $300K = $3,000
- Monthly platform: $50 x 12 = $600
- Support tickets/issues: $??? (time cost)
**Total: $17,100+**

Nickel:
- Card rate: 2.9% x $500K = $14,500
- ACH fees: $0
- Monthly platform: $35 x 12 = $420
- Support: Best-in-class (4.9/5 rating)
**Total: $14,920**

You save $2,180 with Nickel, PLUS you get better support and
real-time QuickBooks sync."
```

**When This Works:**
- Customer is doing honest comparison shopping
- They respond to data and TCO calculations
- They've been burned by Melio/QB Pay pricing changes
- G2 ratings and social proof matter to them

**When It Doesn't Work:**
- Competitor has locked them in with multi-year contract
- They have existing integration/workflow with competitor
- Competitor is subsidizing to win the account (loss leader)
- Decision is made by procurement on rate alone

**Real Example (Carson Crawford, Lake Carolina HOA):**
> Current: ZAGO at 4% cards + $3.95/ACH
>
> Carson: "We're trying to find a cheaper option for our residents"
>
> Colton positioned: Free ACH (vs. $3.95) + 2.9% cards (vs. 4%)
> + Plus plan recurring billing feature
>
> Savings: $9,875 annually in ACH fees alone

**Result:** Strong buying signals - "that really sounds like what they're wanting"

**Key Lesson:** Do the math for them. Most "cheaper" competitors only look cheap on one dimension.

## OBJECTION #5: "I need this for small clients" (Accounting Firms)

**What they're really saying:** "My clients can't justify expensive platforms"

**Your Response Framework:**

**STEP 1 - Validate the Segment Gap**
```
"I hear this from CPAs and bookkeepers constantly. You have:
- High-volume clients who can justify Bill.com ($200+/mo)
- Mid-sized clients who fit on QBO + payments
- Small clients ($20K-$100K revenue) with nowhere to go

That bottom segment - they need ACH but paying $50-100/month
for occasional payments doesn't make sense. That's exactly
who Nickel's free Core plan is built for."
```

**STEP 2 - Position as Portfolio Solution**
```
"Think of Nickel as your 'underserved client' solution:

Bill.com â†’ High-volume clients ($500K+ revenue)
Nickel â†’ Everyone else (startup to $500K)

You're not replacing Bill.com - you're filling the gap
Bill.com created by being too expensive for small clients.
Free Core plan + QuickBooks integration means you can now
offer professional ACH to clients who previously used checks
or Zelle."
```

**STEP 3 - Address Sustainability Concern**
```
"I know you're thinking: 'If it's free, will they disappear
like Melio did?'

Fair question. Here's how we're different:
1. We're already profitable (not burning investor cash)
2. 10,000+ companies using us, Series A coming
3. We make money from Plus subscriptions + card processing
4. Free Core is permanent - it's how we acquire customers
   and get referrals

The G2 reviews (4.9/5) prove it works. Your clients get free
ACH forever, you get happy clients who refer you more business."
```

**STEP 4 - Pilot with Your Own Business**
```
"What I recommend: Test Nickel with your own firm first.
Use it for your rental properties, your own invoicing, or
your fractional CFO clients. Once you see it works, roll it
out to 5-10 small clients as a pilot.

If it saves them money and time, you've just added value
without changing their monthly retainer. That's a win."
```

**When This Works:**
- Accounting/bookkeeping firms with 50-200 clients
- Fractional CFOs serving startups/small businesses
- Business managers serving solopreneurs
- They're already comfortable with Bill.com for big clients

**When It Doesn't Work:**
- They want ONE platform for all clients (not two tools)
- They're loyal to existing provider and won't switch
- They need features Nickel doesn't have (1099 management)

**Real Example (Hardy Butler, Team BlackLine - SUCCESS):**
> Hardy: "I work with a lot of early stage companies... I want to
> be able to send ACH payments in low volume without paying an
> absurd monthly platform fee."
>
> Colton: Positioned Nickel as gap-filler for small clients that
> Bill.com is too expensive for
>
> Hardy: "Just because someone has the volume to go on Bill.com,
> if your platform and solution is pretty slick and good, hell,
> we'll consider that."

**Result:** Qualified opportunity - testing with rental properties first, then client rollout

**Key Lesson:** Don't compete with Bill.com - complement it. You're solving the problem Bill.com created.

## Disqualification Criteria: When to Walk Away

**DO NOT WASTE TIME ON:**

1. **Fortune 500 Supplier Relationships**
   - If their end customers are Fortune 500 demanding 2%+ discounts
   - Example: Erik Meza serving Amazon â†’ margin compression kills deal
   - **Why:** They'll constantly ask for rate reductions you can't provide

2. **QuickBooks Desktop Users Unwilling to Adapt**
   - If they're on QB Desktop and won't do manual export/import
   - Example: RIG Roofing ($1.5M/month) rejected due to "extra steps"
   - **Why:** Integration friction kills value prop of "save time"

3. **Sub-$50K Annual Revenue with No Growth**
   - If they're processing $2K-$5K annually with no growth trajectory
   - **Why:** Not enough volume to monetize, not enough growth to invest in

4. **Locked Into Long-Term Competitor Contracts**
   - If they're 6+ months into a 2-year contract with penalty
   - **Why:** Deal won't close until contract expires

5. **Looking for <2.5% Card Rates Without Volume**
   - If they demand 2.5% or lower but don't have $2M volume
   - **Why:** Creates false hope and wastes leadership's time

**How to Disqualify Gracefully:**
```
"Based on what you've shared, I want to be transparent:
Nickel might not be the right fit right now.

[State the blocker clearly]

What I'd recommend: [Alternative path or competitor]

That said, if [qualifying event], let's absolutely reconnect.
I'll send you a follow-up email in [timeframe] to check in."
```

**Example - Graceful Disqualification:**
> Erik Meza: $800K volume + Fortune 500 customers demanding discounts
>
> Colton: "Unfortunately, that 800,000 isn't enough to hit that
> threshold where we're able to make money back. But if you're able
> to get numbers on that accounts receivable and it looks like it's
> gonna hit that $2M spend mark, just let me know."
>
> **Result:** Deal deferred with clear milestone for reconnection

## Pre-Emptive Objection Handling

**BEFORE THEY OBJECT - SET EXPECTATIONS**

### In Discovery Call:
```
"Before I show you the platform, let me set some expectations
on pricing so there are no surprises:

1. Our card rate is 2.9% - industry standard
2. ACH is 100% free, unlimited
3. We don't negotiate rates below $2M+ annual card volume
4. We're profitable and sustainable (not burning VC cash)

If that pricing structure works for your model, let's dive in.
If you're looking for 2.5% or lower cards, I want to be honest
upfront that we're probably not the right fit."
```

**Why This Works:**
- Disqualifies before you waste 40 minutes on demo
- Sets frame that you're selective (not desperate)
- Customers respect transparency
- If they stay on call, they're qualified

### During Feature Demo:
```
[After showing free ACH]
"I want to pause here because this is where customers sometimes
get confused. They see 'free ACH' and think everything is free.

Here's how it actually works:
- ACH: Always free, always unlimited
- Cards: 2.9% processing fee
- You control: Who pays that 2.9% (you, customer, or split)

This model only works if your customers pay primarily by ACH,
or you're comfortable passing card fees to customers. Does that
match your business model?"
```

**Why This Works:**
- Prevents "bait and switch" feeling
- Customer self-selects in/out
- Shows you're consultative, not just selling

---

## The "Competitor Changed Pricing" Narrative
**(YOUR MOST POWERFUL WEAPON)**

**When to Use:**
- Customer mentions QuickBooks, Melio, or Bill.com
- Customer says "I used to use [competitor]"
- Customer asks "How do you make money?"
- Customer is price-sensitive in low-margin industry

**The Script:**
```
"Can I share something that I think is really relevant?

Over the past 2-3 years, there's been a massive industry shift.
Companies like QuickBooks, Melio, and Build.com all used to
offer completely free ACH to their customers. Millions of
businesses built their operations around that free ACH.

Then, literally overnight, these companies realized 'Hey, we've
got customers locked in - let's monetize this.' QuickBooks went
first, charging 1-2% on ACH. Then Melio followed. Then others.

Businesses that were paying ZERO suddenly got bills for hundreds
or thousands of dollars per month - just to get money into their
bank accounts.

Our founders watched this happen and saw a massive opportunity:
What if we built a sustainable, profitable business model that
could offer free ACH PERMANENTLY - not as a loss leader, but as
part of the core offering?

That's Nickel. We're profitable because we make money from
subscriptions and credit card processing. Free ACH is how we
win customers and keep them happy. We're not going to pull a
Melio on you.

The businesses hurt worst by this pricing shift were construction,
wholesale distribution, professional services - industries with
3-6% margins. [If applicable: That's your industry.] Nickel is
purpose-built to be the permanent free ACH solution for businesses
that can't afford to get nickel-and-dimed."
```

**Why This Is So Powerful:**
- Creates emotional connection (people hate being screwed)
- Positions competitors as greedy/untrustworthy
- Explains your business model without being defensive
- Makes price objections feel petty (vs. betrayal they already experienced)

**Real-World Impact:**
- 7 out of 7 high-resonance moments used this narrative
- Emma Benson: "Wow, okay. I like that a lot because we've been paying higher ACH fees"
- Ramon Otero: "There's nobody out there that is providing free ACH. It's just unheard of."
- Brent Rose: Mentioned QuickBooks upselling problems - narrative resonated immediately

---

## Pricing Objection Escalation Path

**TIER 1 - Rep Handles (95% of objections)**
- Standard pricing objections
- Competitor comparisons
- Volume threshold questions
- "Can you negotiate?" asks

**Response:** Use this playbook

**TIER 2 - Manager Review (4% of objections)**
- Borderline volume cases ($1.5M-$2M)
- Strategic accounts with growth potential
- Complex multi-entity deals
- Integration requirement negotiations

**Response:** Escalate to Christian/Ray with:
- Full qualification (volume, use case, timeline)
- Why it's strategic (partnership, referrals, etc.)
- Proposed terms (what would make it work?)

**TIER 3 - Leadership Approval (1% of objections)**
- $2M+ volume with AR commitment
- API partnership deals (50K+ transactions/month)
- Multi-year enterprise contracts

**Response:** Requires written proposal with:
- Volume commitment (minimums)
- Implementation scope/fees
- Contract term (12+ months)
- Strategic value beyond revenue

**Example - TIER 3 Approval (VIP Software):**
- $1.20/ACH for 50,000 monthly minimum
- $5,000 implementation fee
- 12-month commitment
- Strategic partnership with API integration
- Approval required: Ray Fu + Christian Sheerer sign-off
