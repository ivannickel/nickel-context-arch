- Provide marketing materials they can share

### Account Denial Response

- Clear statements about business model and referral focus
- Explicit mention of 24 industry categories
- New business status confirmed (February 2025 establishment)
- Most of call focused on account denial rather than normal use case
- Less detail on typical transaction patterns and client work
