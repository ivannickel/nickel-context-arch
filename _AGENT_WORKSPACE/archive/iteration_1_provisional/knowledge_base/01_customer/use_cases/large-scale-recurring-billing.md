# Use Case: Large-Scale Recurring Billing

## Summary
Organizations that collect recurring payments from large customer bases (HOAs, property management, membership organizations, subscription businesses) need flexible, automated billing with self-service payment plan options and zero-fee ACH to reduce costs for payers.

## Description
Large-scale recurring billing addresses the needs of organizations with:
- **High customer volume:** 500-10,000+ payers
- **Recurring payment cycles:** Monthly, quarterly, or annual assessments/subscriptions
- **Payment flexibility needs:** Allow customers to choose payment frequency
- **Cost reduction goals:** Eliminate per-transaction fees that add up at scale
- **Self-service requirements:** Customers manage their own payment schedules

This use case is particularly relevant for:
- **Homeowners Associations (HOAs):** Annual assessments, special assessments
- **Property management companies:** Rent collection, HOA management
- **Membership organizations:** Gym memberships, club dues, associations
- **Subscription businesses:** SaaS, content, services with recurring revenue
- **Education:** Tuition, course fees with payment plans

## Fit Assessment

### Excellent Fit Indicators
- **Customer volume:** 500+ recurring payers
- **Payment frequency:** Monthly, quarterly, or annual cycles
- **Payment flexibility required:** Want to offer multiple payment schedule options
- **Cost sensitivity:** Per-transaction fees unsustainable at scale
- **Digital adoption:** Customer base comfortable with online payments
- **Self-service preference:** Don't want to manually manage payment schedules
- **ACH-first strategy:** Prefer/require zero-fee payment option

### Moderate Fit Indicators
- **Customer volume:** 100-500 recurring payers
- **Mixed payment needs:** Some recurring, some one-time
- **Manual oversight:** Want to approve/review payment schedules
- **Credit card acceptance:** Some customers want to pay by card despite fees

### Poor Fit Indicators
- **Low volume:** Less than 100 recurring payers
- **Simple annual billing:** No need for flexible payment plans
- **Check preference:** Customer base resistant to electronic payments
- **Complex billing:** Usage-based billing, variable amounts, tiered pricing
- **Integration requirements:** Need integration with industry-specific software (e.g., HOA management systems)

## Indicators from Transcripts

### Carson Crawford (Lake Carolina HOA)
**Organization context:**
- **Size:** 2,500 homeowners
- **Annual assessment:** $1,149.50 currently, increasing to ~$1,260
- **Total annual revenue:** ~$3,000,000
- **Current system:** TOPS (accounting/violations) with ZAGO payment processing
- **Decision timeline:** Board meeting next week for fee increase approval

**Pain points:**
**Quote:** "TOPS uses a thing called ZAGO. And what they do, they charge almost 4% on credit cards and then $3.95 per ACH."
- **Current cost:** $3.95 Ã— 2,500 homeowners = $9,875 annually (if all pay ACH once)
- **Credit card cost:** 4% on ~$3M = $120,000 if all paid by credit card
- **Board priority:** "I did notice that you guys offered a free ACH which I think is more online of what our board wants" - cost reduction for homeowners

**Payment flexibility need:**
**Quote:** "We're wanting to go to more of, like, a, I want to call it like a pay as you go, but we're giving our homeowners an option, like, hey, we don't care if you make one payment. We don't care if you make 12 payments. We don't care if you make 52 payments."
- **Desired state:** Homeowners choose: annual, monthly, weekly, or custom payment frequency
- **Business goal:** "We want them to have the option to budget"
- **Current limitation:** TOPS/ZAGO cannot support flexible self-service payment plans

**Quote:** "We're wanting to get them to where if they want to, they can pay us $1,200 a month or $100 a month... we want them to have the option to budget."
- **Payment amount flexibility:** Homeowners choose amount per payment (must total annual assessment)
- **Self-service requirement:** Homeowners set up their own schedule
- **No-call goal:** "If we could get it to where it's a no call, that that would probably even stop the checks from coming in"

**Multi-channel delivery:**
**Quote:** "By our bylaws, we have to send them an invoice by mail. By mail. But we also. Yeah, by mail. But we also send by email."
- **Compliance constraint:** Physical mail required by HOA bylaws
- **Digital preference:** Also send email and want web portal self-service
- **Nickel solution:** Email/text invoice delivery from Nickel, download PDF for physical mailing

**Payment portal:**
**Quote:** "That would be something we would like, you know, that something that, you know, they just go click, hey, go click payments and be done with it."
- **User flow:** Homeowner visits HOA website > clicks payment link > makes payment
- **Branded experience:** Custom URL/domain for professional HOA image
- **Self-service:** No office contact required

**Credit card surcharge:**
**Quote:** "We have some that are wanting to make payments via credit card... they'd be charged a 2.99% fee that would be 100% paid for by the homeowner"
- **Business rule:** Homeowner pays processing fee, not HOA
- **Compliance:** Colton confirmed 50-state surcharge compliance
- **Volume:** Subset of 2,500 homeowners who prefer credit cards

**Implementation concerns:**
**Quote:** "As far as creating an invoice in your system, all right, would I have to do that manually per, Resident."
- **Fear:** Manual data entry for 2,500 residents
- **Resolution:** CSV upload for both customers and invoices
- **Support:** Nickel support team assists with CSV mapping and bulk import

**Buying signals:**
- "Yeah, that really sounds like kind of what they're wanting" (Plus plan)
- Watched demo before call
- Already evaluating specific plan tier (Plus)
- Asking implementation questions (CSV upload, invoice creation)
- Timeline awareness (board meeting next week)

## Common Objections

### "We need integration with our HOA management software (TOPS, Buildium, etc.)"
**Answer:** We don't have direct integration with HOA management systems today. However, you can:
1. Export customer data from TOPS via CSV
2. Import to Nickel (we help with mapping)
3. Process payments through Nickel
4. Export payment data and import back to TOPS (or use QuickBooks as bridge)

Most customers find the cost savings (free ACH vs $3.95 per transaction) worth the minor export/import step.

### "Our bylaws require physical mail invoices"
**Answer:** No problem! Nickel sends email/SMS for convenience, but you can also download PDF invoices to print and mail for bylaw compliance. Many HOAs do both: email for speed, mail for compliance.

### "Will homeowners actually use the payment portal?"
**Answer:** Yes! We see 60-80% electronic payment adoption within 3-6 months. Keys to success:
1. Make it super easy (one-click from email)
2. Offer free ACH (vs $3.95 fee they pay now)
3. Communicate the benefits (pay from phone, choose payment plan)
4. Lead by example (board members use it first)

You'll always have some check diehards, but the majority prefer electronic once they try it.

### "What if homeowners set up payment plans that don't total the annual assessment?"
**Answer:** You have full control. Options:
1. Pre-set payment plan templates (e.g., 12 Ã— $105 = $1,260)
2. Allow self-service but review before approving
3. Set minimum payment amount rules

You decide how much flexibility to offer vs how much control to maintain.

### "What happens if a recurring ACH payment fails?"
**Answer:** You get instant email notification. You can then:
1. Contact homeowner to update payment method
2. Attempt payment again
3. Add late fees (per your bylaws)
4. Track failed payments in dashboard for follow-up

Most failures are simple fixes (expired account, insufficient funds) that get resolved quickly.

### "Our board needs to approve this - what do you recommend?"
**Answer:** Great! Here's what to share with your board:
1. **Cost savings:** $9,875/year minimum (free ACH vs $3.95 per transaction)
2. **Homeowner benefit:** Payment flexibility, zero fees for ACH
3. **Operational efficiency:** Reduce office check processing time
4. **Security:** Eliminate check fraud risk
5. **Pilot approach:** Test with 50-100 homeowners before full rollout
6. **Easy migration:** CSV import, support team assistance
7. **Low risk:** $420/year, cancel anytime

I can also send a demo video and pricing sheet for the board meeting.
