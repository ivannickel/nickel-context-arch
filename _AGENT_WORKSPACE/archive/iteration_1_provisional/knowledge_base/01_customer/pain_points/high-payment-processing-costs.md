## Description

High payment processing costs represent a widespread pain point affecting businesses of all sizes, but particularly acute for construction contractors, property managers, and small businesses with high transaction volumes. The pain encompasses multiple fee types:

1. **Wire transfer fees**: $15-25 per transaction at traditional banks
2. **ACH processing fees**: $3-7 per transaction or monthly minimums
3. **Credit card processing fees**: 2.5-4% that businesses must absorb
4. **Platform fees**: Monthly subscription costs for payment processing software

For businesses processing dozens or hundreds of payments monthly, these fees compound into significant annual expenses that directly impact profitability. The pain is intensified when:
- Businesses operate on thin margins (3-6% typical in construction)
- High transaction volumes amplify per-transaction fees
- Customers refuse to pay credit card surcharges
- Traditional banking solutions offer no alternatives

## Evidence from Transcripts

### Prime Renovations (Jeff Streich) - HIGH Severity

**Traditional Banking Fees:**
> "My wire transfers, five bucks... So they really why it's 15 bucks. Every outgoing why is 15. For me to do ACH through them is a nightmare, you know?"
> - Source: 003_prime-renovations-ny-nickel_2025-07-23.md, Lines 42-46

**Context:**
Jeff migrated from TD Bank (20-year relationship) to Relay Financial specifically to escape high fees:
- TD Bank: $15 per wire transfer
- Relay Financial: $5 per wire transfer
- This 67% reduction was compelling enough to switch banks after 20 years

**QuickBooks Pay Frustration:**
> "I'm not using the QuickBooks Pay because I hate them... And I love, again, the ACH is from my bank is fine, but they still, I don't have them talking to each other, really."
> - Source: 003_prime-renovations-ny-nickel_2025-07-23.md, Lines 200-202

Jeff abandoned QuickBooks Pay due to pricing increases and slow processing, despite integration benefits.

### Carson Crawford (HOA Manager) - HIGH Severity

**Current Payment Provider Fees:**
> "TOPS uses a thing called ZAGO. And what they do, they charge almost 4% on credit cards and then $3.95 per ACH."
> - Source: 004_carson-crawford-and-colton-ofarrell_2025-08-14.md, Lines 25-26

**Critical Context:**
- 2,500 homeowners x $1,200 annual dues = $3M in payments processed
- $3.95 per ACH x 2,500 transactions = $9,875 in fees (if all ACH)
- 4% credit card fee on any card payments compounds costs
- HOA seeking solution specifically to reduce member costs

**Explicit Goal:**
> "We're wanting to go to more of, like, a, I want to call it like a pay as you go, but we're giving our homeowners an option... we're trying to find a cheaper option for our residents"
> - Source: 004_carson-crawford-and-colton-ofarrell_2025-08-14.md, Lines 25-26

### Prime Renovations (Additional Evidence)

**Monthly Platform Fees:**
> "I just spent 90 a month with them [Relay Financial] to get the top tier thing because I thought I was getting other benefits, which I'm really not getting, but I don't even care. It's just so freaking easy."
> - Source: 003_prime-renovations-ny-nickel_2025-07-23.md, Lines 50-51

**Analysis:**
Willing to pay $90/month ($1,080/year) for ease of use, but acknowledges not getting value from premium tier. Shows price sensitivity exists but convenience can override it.

**ProCore Cost Concerns:**
> "Love Procore, little expensive by the way, the whole freaking system. And every time you want to add something, you got to pay more, but whatever."
> - Source: 003_prime-renovations-ny-nickel_2025-07-23.md, Line 60

Pattern of software costs accumulating across multiple systems.

## Competitive Context

### Traditional Banking Costs

- **ACH**: $3-7 per transaction OR monthly minimum balance
- **International**: $40-50+ per transaction
- **Monthly Fees**: $20-50 for business accounts
- **Issue**: Fees are non-negotiable, no volume discounts for small business

### Payment Platform Costs

- **Relay Financial**: $90/month for premium features (10 free ACH, then charges)
- **Issue**: "Free" solutions became paid, eroding customer trust

### Construction-Specific Platforms
