      - insight: "Use cases had 100% validation rate - these were accurate predictions"
        action: "Invest in more detailed use case discovery in iteration 2"

      - insight: "Compliance process opacity is critical severity despite single mention"
        action: "Prioritize operational fix for compliance communication"

      - insight: "Accounting firm buyer persona is high-value strategic discovery"

        - tag: "relay-financial"

    pattern_stability_score: 72/100
    calculation: |
      Base score: 50
      + Seed validation (43.75% * 20 points) = +8.75
      + High confidence tags (23/69 * 30 points) = +10
      + Category consistency (4/5 categories >20% validation) = +3.25
      = 72/100

      Interpretation: MODERATE-HIGH stability
      - Enough patterns to inform strategy
      - Significant emergent discovery (good for iteration 1)
      - Need iteration 2 to confirm single-mention tags

    decision_for_iteration_2: |
      PROCEED with current taxonomy structure

      Reasons:
      1. High confidence tags (23) provide solid foundation
      2. Use case validation (100%) confirms market fit accuracy
      3. Emergent tags reveal real customer language
      4. No structural taxonomy changes needed

      Actions for iteration 2:
      1. Process 4+ transcripts focusing on:
         - Accounting firm buyers (validate persona)
         - Relay Financial competitive scenarios
         - Business model sustainability objections
      2. Consolidate duplicate volume threshold tags
      3. Retire low-confidence tags if not revalidated
      4. Target: 85+ pattern stability score
