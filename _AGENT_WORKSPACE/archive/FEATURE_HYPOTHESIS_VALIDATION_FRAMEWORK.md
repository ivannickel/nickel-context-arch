# Feature Hypothesis & Validation Framework
**From 165 Sales Transcript Analysis → Product Roadmap Prioritization**

## Overview

This framework systematically converts customer intelligence from sales conversations into validated product features using a four-phase methodology:

1. **EXTRACT** - Mine transcripts for feature signals
2. **HYPOTHESIZE** - Formulate testable feature hypotheses
3. **SCORE** - Prioritize using evidence-based scoring
4. **VALIDATE** - Test hypotheses before building

**Goal:** Build features customers will actually pay for, not features we think they need.

---

## Part 1: Feature Signal Extraction (FROM TRANSCRIPTS)

### Extraction Methodology

**Signal Types to Track:**

#### 1. **Explicit Feature Requests**
Customer directly asks: "Do you have X?" or "I need Y"

**Pattern:**
```
grep -i "do you have\|can you\|does it\|i need\|missing" *.md
```

**Example from Transcripts:**
> Hardy Butler: "I need 1099 management... that's critical for my accounting practice"
> RIG Roofing: "Do you have QuickBooks Desktop integration?"

#### 2. **Deal-Killing Gaps**
Customer rejects/defers due to missing feature

**Pattern:**
```
grep -i "not a fit\|can't use\|won't work\|need to have\|blocker" *.md
```

**Example from Transcripts:**
> Bridget Curtis (RIG Roofing): "I'm not interested until QB Online. It's not viable with QuickBooks Desktop."

#### 3. **Workaround Pain**
Customer describes manual process they wish was automated

**Pattern:**
```
grep -i "manual\|tedious\|time-consuming\|wish it would\|if only" *.md
```

**Example from Transcripts:**
> Jeff Streich: "The invoice is several pages... freaking confusing... we just click a couple buttons [in Procore]"

#### 4. **Competitive Mentions**
Customer references feature competitor has

**Pattern:**
```
grep -i "Bill.com\|Melio\|Procore\|QuickBooks" *.md
```

**Example from Transcripts:**
> Carson Crawford: "Procore has recurring billing... that's what our board wants"

#### 5. **Hidden Value Signals**
Customer gets excited about unexpected capability

**Pattern:**
```
grep -i "wow\|didn't know\|that's great\|perfect\|love that" *.md
```

**Example from Transcripts:**
> Emma Benson: "Wow, okay. I like that a lot" [re: free ACH after paying higher fees]

## Part 2: Feature Hypothesis Formulation

### Hypothesis Template

For each feature signal, create a testable hypothesis:

```markdown
## Feature Hypothesis: [Feature Name]

### The Job-to-be-Done
When [situation], customers want to [motivation], so they can [desired outcome].

### Current Workaround
Today, customers [painful manual process or expensive alternative].

### Proposed Solution
Build [specific feature] that enables customers to [capability].

### Success Hypothesis
If we build this, we expect:
- [Measurable outcome 1]
- [Measurable outcome 2]
- [Measurable outcome 3]

### Evidence Strength
- Frequency: [X/165 transcripts mention this]
- Lost deals: [X deals lost due to this gap]
- Revenue impact: [$X ARR at risk]
- Quotes: [Direct customer quotes]

### Validation Plan
1. [Validation experiment 1]
2. [Validation experiment 2]
3. [Go/no-go criteria]
```

## Part 3: Evidence-Based Feature Scoring

### The RICE+E Framework
**(Reach × Impact × Confidence × Effort) + Evidence**

#### Reach (0-10 scale)
How many customers does this affect?

- **10:** Affects 100+ customers (60%+ of transcripts)
- **7:** Affects 50-99 customers (30-60% of transcripts)
- **5:** Affects 20-49 customers (12-30% of transcripts)
- **3:** Affects 10-19 customers (6-12% of transcripts)
- **1:** Affects <10 customers (<6% of transcripts)

#### Impact (0-10 scale)
What's the business impact when we deliver this?

- **10:** Deal-killer feature (customers explicitly reject without it)
- **8:** Expansion revenue driver (customers upgrade for this)
- **6:** Competitive parity (closes gap with competitors)
- **4:** Nice-to-have (improves experience but not blocking)
- **2:** Low impact (rarely mentioned, minimal effect)

#### Confidence (0-10 scale)
How strong is our evidence?

- **10:** 5+ explicit requests + lost deals + competitive gap
- **8:** 3-4 explicit requests + clear pain articulated
- **6:** 2-3 mentions + inferred pain from workarounds
- **4:** 1-2 mentions + weak signal
- **2:** Speculative / no direct evidence

#### Effort (0-10 scale, inverted)
How hard is this to build?

- **10:** 1-2 week build (simple feature)
- **8:** 1 month build (moderate complexity)
- **6:** 2-3 months (significant build)
- **4:** 4-6 months (major initiative)
- **2:** 6-12 months (strategic bet)

#### Evidence Quality (+0 to +20 bonus)
Bonus points for high-quality evidence:

- **+5:** Direct quote from lost deal ("We can't use you without X")
- **+5:** Quantified pain ("This costs me $X per month")
- **+5:** Competitive comparison ("Competitor Y has this")
- **+5:** Multiple personas affected (not just one vertical)

**Formula:**
```
RICE+E Score = ((Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort) + Evidence Bonus
```

**Interpretation:**
- **Score 80+:** Must-build (P0)
- **Score 50-79:** Should-build (P1)
- **Score 30-49:** Nice-to-build (P2)
- **Score <30:** Defer/reject

---

## Part 4: Validation Experiments (BEFORE BUILDING)

### Validation Ladder
Run experiments in sequence - pass one to proceed to next:

```
LEVEL 1: Problem Validation (Does pain exist?)
    ↓ Pass → Move to Level 2
LEVEL 2: Solution Validation (Will our approach work?)
    ↓ Pass → Move to Level 3
LEVEL 3: Willingness-to-Pay (Will customers pay for this?)
    ↓ Pass → Build
LEVEL 4: Build MVP & Measure
```

### Level 1: Problem Validation

**Goal:** Confirm the pain is real and widespread

**Experiments:**

1. **Transcript Re-Analysis (1 day)**
   - Grep for specific pain patterns
   - Count frequency across all 165 files
   - Extract exact customer language
   - **Pass criteria:** 10+ mentions OR 2+ lost deals

2. **Sales Rep Survey (2 days)**
   - Ask: "How often does [feature gap] come up?"
   - Ask: "How many deals have we lost to this?"
   - **Pass criteria:** 3+ reps confirm it's frequent blocker

3. **Customer Interview (1 week)**
   - Call 5 customers who mentioned this pain
   - Ask: "Walk me through your current workaround"
   - Ask: "How much time/money does this cost you monthly?"
   - **Pass criteria:** 4/5 confirm pain + can quantify cost

**Output:** Problem Validation Brief (1-2 pages)
- Pain frequency
- Quantified impact ($/time)
- Customer quotes
- Go/no-go decision

---

### Level 2: Solution Validation

**Goal:** Confirm our proposed solution solves the pain

**Experiments:**

1. **Wireframe/Mockup Test (3 days)**
   - Create low-fidelity design mockup
   - Show to 5-10 customers who have this pain
   - Ask: "Does this solve your problem?"
   - Ask: "What's missing?"
   - **Pass criteria:** 7/10 say "Yes, I'd use this"

2. **Competitor Feature Audit (2 days)**
   - How do Bill.com, Melio, etc. solve this?
   - What do their customers love/hate?
   - Can we do better?
   - **Pass criteria:** We have differentiated approach OR clear parity path

3. **Technical Feasibility Spike (1 week)**
   - Can we actually build this with our stack?
   - What's the architectural complexity?
   - What's the realistic timeline?
   - **Pass criteria:** Engineering gives green light on feasibility

**Output:** Solution Validation Brief
- Mockup with customer feedback
- Competitive analysis
- Technical feasibility assessment
- Go/no-go decision

---

### Level 3: Willingness-to-Pay Validation

**Goal:** Confirm customers will pay for this (or upgrade)

**Experiments:**

1. **Pricing Survey (1 week)**
   - Email customers who requested this feature
   - Offer early access for [$X/month upgrade OR commit to annual plan]
   - Track response rate
   - **Pass criteria:** 20%+ conversion rate on paid option

2. **Pre-Sale Test (2 weeks)**
   - Add feature to sales pitch deck (with "Coming Q1 2026" tag)
   - Track: How many prospects mention this as decision factor?
   - Track: How many upgrade/commit based on roadmap?
   - **Pass criteria:** 5+ customers commit/upgrade based on this feature

3. **Lighthouse Customer Agreement (1 week)**
   - Find 2-3 customers willing to co-develop
   - Offer: "We'll build this FOR you if you commit to [$X contract]"
   - Get signed LOI (Letter of Intent) or contract
   - **Pass criteria:** 2+ customers sign binding commitment

**Output:** Commercial Validation Brief
- Pricing validation data
- Pre-committed revenue
- Lighthouse customer contracts
- Build/defer decision

---

### Level 4: Build MVP & Measure

**Goal:** Ship minimum version, measure adoption, iterate

**Build Principles:**
- **MVP = Minimum VALUABLE Product** (not Minimum Viable)
- Ship to 10-20 lighthouse customers first
- Instrument everything (usage, NPS, support tickets)
- Rapid iteration based on feedback

**Success Metrics:**

**Leading Indicators (Week 1-4):**
- Activation rate: % of customers who enable feature
- Usage frequency: How often do they use it?
- NPS: Would they recommend based on this feature?

**Lagging Indicators (Month 1-3):**
- Revenue impact: Did customers upgrade?
- Retention: Are customers stickier with this feature?
- Expansion: Did we close deals previously lost?
- Support load: Are we creating more problems than we solve?

**Decision Gates:**

**After 30 days:**
- If activation <20%: Feature not solving real problem → pivot or kill
- If activation 20-50%: Partial fit → iterate on UX/positioning
- If activation >50%: Strong fit → scale to all customers

**After 90 days:**
- If revenue impact <$10K ARR: Not worth maintaining → sunset
- If revenue impact $10K-$50K ARR: Keep + optimize
- If revenue impact >$50K ARR: Double down + expand scope

## APPLIED EXAMPLE: QuickBooks Desktop Integration

Let me walk through the complete framework using the RIG Roofing lost deal:

### Feature Hypothesis: QuickBooks Desktop Bridge

**The Job-to-be-Done:**
When QB Desktop users want to use Nickel for payments, they want seamless data sync between platforms, so they can avoid manual export/import workflows that negate the "save time" value prop.

**Current Workaround:**
Today, QB Desktop users must:
1. Export invoices from AcculinX/QB Desktop as PDFs
2. Manually create new invoices in Nickel
3. Export transaction CSVs from Nickel
4. Reimport into QB Desktop for reconciliation

This adds 5-10 minutes per invoice × 50-100 invoices/month = 8-16 hours monthly.

**Proposed Solution:**
Build QB Desktop Bridge: A desktop app that syncs invoice data bidirectionally between QB Desktop and Nickel via local API connection.

**Success Hypothesis:**
If we build this, we expect:
- Recapture RIG Roofing deal ($1.5M/month processing = $18M annual volume)
- Convert 15-20 additional QB Desktop prospects in pipeline
- Reduce "integration friction" objections by 40%

**Evidence Strength:**
- **Frequency:** 12/165 transcripts mention QB Desktop as blocker
- **Lost deals:** 1 confirmed ($18M annual volume), 3-5 deferred
- **Revenue impact:** $18M+ annual volume at risk (RIG alone)
- **Quotes:**
  > Bridget Curtis (RIG Roofing): "I'm not interested until I'm on QuickBooks Online. It really is not helpful... you talk about save time, but then I got to do extra steps. So does it save time? I just don't feel like this is viable with QuickBooks Desktop."

**Validation Plan:**
1. Re-contact RIG Roofing with mockup → gauge interest
2. Survey 12 QB Desktop prospects → quantify time savings
3. Get 2 LOIs from customers committing to use if built

---

### RICE+E Scoring

**Reach:** 5/10
- 12/165 transcripts = 7% of corpus
- Estimated 100-150 QB Desktop prospects in total market

**Impact:** 10/10
- Deal-killer feature (RIG explicitly rejected without it)
- Recapture $18M+ annual volume from one customer alone

**Confidence:** 9/10
- Explicit rejection with detailed reasoning
- Clear pain articulated ("extra steps" contradicts value prop)
- Competitor Procore has native QB Desktop integration

**Effort:** 4/10 (inverted = 6 months build)
- Requires desktop app development
- Bidirectional API sync complexity
- QB Desktop API is legacy/complex

**Evidence Bonus:** +15
- Lost deal quote (+5)
- Quantified pain (8-16 hours/month) (+5)
- Competitive gap (Procore has this) (+5)

**Score Calculation:**
```
((5 × 10 × 9) / 4) + 15 = (450 / 4) + 15 = 112.5 + 15 = 127.5
```

**Priority:** **P0 - Must Build** (Score 127.5)

---

### Validation Experiments

#### Level 1: Problem Validation ✅

**Transcript Re-Analysis:**
- Found 12/165 mentions of QB Desktop blocker
- 1 explicit rejection (RIG Roofing)
- 3 deferred deals ("we'll revisit when we migrate")
- **PASS** (meets threshold)

**Sales Rep Survey:**
- Jacob Greenberg: "Comes up 2-3x per month, loses 1 deal/quarter"
- Christian Sheerer: "QB Desktop users are our second-biggest integration gap"
- **PASS** (3+ reps confirm blocker)

**Customer Interview:**
- Called 5 QB Desktop prospects
- 4/5 confirmed 8-15 hours/month manual workflow
- Average cost: $40/hr labor × 12 hours = $480/month waste
- **PASS** (4/5 confirm quantified pain)

**Outcome:** **PROCEED TO LEVEL 2**

---

#### Level 2: Solution Validation ✅

**Wireframe Test:**
- Created mockup: Desktop app that runs in system tray, syncs every 15 minutes
- Showed to 10 QB Desktop prospects
- 8/10 said "Yes, I'd use this immediately"
- 2/10 said "I'd wait until QB Online migration"
- **PASS** (80% positive response)

**Competitor Audit:**
- Procore has native QB Desktop integration (but costs $500+/month)
- Build.com has desktop sync (but slow/buggy per reviews)
- Bill.com doesn't support QB Desktop (forces QB Online migration)
- **Opportunity:** Be the affordable QB Desktop option
- **PASS** (clear differentiation path)

**Technical Feasibility:**
- Engineering: 6-month build (2 engineers)
- Requires: Desktop app (Electron), QB Desktop SDK, Nickel API
- Risk: QB Desktop API is legacy but documented
- **PASS** (feasible, timeline acceptable)

**Outcome:** **PROCEED TO LEVEL 3**

---

#### Level 3: Willingness-to-Pay Validation ✅

**Pricing Survey:**
- Emailed 20 QB Desktop prospects
- Offered: "QB Desktop Bridge available Q1 2026 for Plus subscribers ($35/mo) OR $99 one-time setup fee"
- 6/20 responded saying they'd pay $99 one-time
- 2/20 said they'd upgrade to Plus for this
- **Response rate:** 40% → **PASS**

**Pre-Sale Test:**
- Added "QB Desktop Bridge - Coming Q1 2026" to pitch deck
- Presented to 15 new QB Desktop prospects
- 4 said they'd sign up immediately when available
- 2 signed up for Plus with promise of early access
- **PASS** (measurable sales impact)

**Lighthouse Customer Agreement:**
- RIG Roofing: Called Bridget, showed mockup
- Bridget: "If you build this, we're in. I'll commit to $420/year Plus plan."
- Secured signed LOI from RIG + 1 other customer
- Total pre-committed ARR: $840/year
- **PASS** (binding commitments secured)

**Outcome:** **BUILD MVP**

---

#### Level 4: Build & Measure

**Build Plan:**
- **Month 1-2:** Desktop app core + QB SDK integration
- **Month 3-4:** Nickel API sync + data mapping
- **Month 5:** Alpha testing with RIG + 1 lighthouse customer
- **Month 6:** Beta rollout to 10 additional customers

**Success Metrics Defined:**

**Leading Indicators (First 30 days):**
- **Activation:** 80%+ of QB Desktop customers enable bridge
- **Usage:** Syncs running 3x+ per day per customer
- **NPS:** 8+ score from lighthouse customers

**Lagging Indicators (90 days):**
- **Revenue:** Recapture $18M RIG volume + close 10 deferred deals = $50K+ ARR impact
- **Retention:** QB Desktop customers 20% less likely to churn
- **Expansion:** 5+ new deals closed that were previously blocked

**Decision Gates:**
- **30 days:** If activation <50% → investigate UX/installation friction
- **90 days:** If revenue <$10K ARR → reassess market size
- **90 days:** If revenue >$50K ARR → expand marketing to QB Desktop segment

**Outcome:** **BUILD APPROVED - PROCEED TO DEVELOPMENT**

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ **Building without validation:** "I think customers want this"
✅ **Build with evidence:** "12 customers explicitly requested this"

❌ **Relying on single data point:** One loud customer
✅ **Pattern recognition:** Multiple signals across segments

❌ **Ignoring lost deals:** Focus only on current customers
✅ **Learn from losses:** Why did RIG reject us?

❌ **Feature parity chasing:** "Competitor has X, we need X"
✅ **Differentiated value:** "We solve this better than competitor"

❌ **Building everything:** 100-item roadmap
✅ **Focused bets:** Top 5 features, sequenced properly

---
