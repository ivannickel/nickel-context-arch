# Agent 3: Validation_Analyst

**Role:** Quality Gate Assessor + Decision Gate
**Pattern:** Iterative Refinement Loop - Validation Gate
**Execution:** After sample batch completion (Checkpoint 1) and full corpus (Checkpoint 2)
**Version:** 1.0
**Created:** 2025-10-30

---

## Purpose

Assess quality and pattern validation across batch of processed transcripts to make GO/NO-GO decisions for scaling to full corpus.

**Critical Responsibilities:**
- Measure pattern revalidation rate (did Iteration 1 patterns reappear?)
- Measure new discovery rate (novel patterns emerged?)
- Assess quality (attribution complete? strategic_fit calculated?)
- Generate GO/NO-GO decision with evidence
- Identify lens refinements needed if NO-GO
- Track iteration count (max 3 before human escalation)

---

## Input Requirements

### Required for Checkpoint 1 (Sample Batch)

**Batch of Nodes:**
- 50-100 knowledge graph nodes from 10-20 transcripts
- Location: `knowledge_base/01_customer/`, `knowledge_base/00_foundation/`
- Node types: personas, pain_points, objections, use_cases, competitive_intel

**Taxonomy Updates:**
- `knowledge_base/taxonomy.yaml` (updated with frequency changes)
- Baseline: 67 patterns from Iteration 1 (strategic_lens.yaml v1.1)

**Context:**
- `knowledge_base/strategic_lens.yaml` v1.1
- `_AGENT_WORKSPACE/agents/ORCHESTRATION_ARCHITECTURE.md` (quality criteria)

---

### Required for Checkpoint 2 (Full Corpus)

**Full Corpus Nodes:**
- 700-1500 knowledge graph nodes from 165 transcripts
- Same locations and types as Checkpoint 1

**Final Taxonomy:**
- Complete frequency distribution
- Pattern stability analysis
- Emergent → validated → canonical status progression

---

## Validation Process

### Step 1: Pattern Revalidation Analysis (15-20 min)

**Objective:** Measure how many Iteration 1 patterns (67 from strategic_lens.yaml) reappeared in sample batch

**Method:**
```yaml
For each pattern in strategic_lens.yaml v1.1:
  baseline_freq: [from lens, default 1 if emergent]

  Check taxonomy.yaml:
    current_freq: [frequency after sample batch]

  If current_freq > baseline_freq:
    pattern_status: "REVALIDATED"
    revalidation_evidence: [transcript IDs where it appeared]
  Else:
    pattern_status: "NOT SEEN"
    concern_level: [based on lens priority]
```

**Revalidation Rate Calculation:**
```yaml
total_lens_patterns = 67
patterns_revalidated = [count of patterns with freq increase]

revalidation_rate = (patterns_revalidated / total_lens_patterns) × 100%

Pass threshold: ≥60% (40 of 67 patterns should reappear)
```

**Example:**
```yaml
Iteration 1 patterns from lens:
  - quickbooks-integration (lens: priority 1, freq 4)
    Sample batch: freq increased to 8
    Status: REVALIDATED ✅

  - volume-threshold-barriers (lens: priority 1, freq 6)
    Sample batch: freq increased to 11
    Status: REVALIDATED ✅

  - accounting-firm-buyer (lens: priority 1, freq 1, status emergent)
    Sample batch: freq increased to 4
    Status: REVALIDATED ✅ (emergent → validated)

  - fortune-500-vendor-segment (lens: priority 2, freq 1)
    Sample batch: freq still 1 (not seen again)
    Status: NOT SEEN ⚠️ (may be outlier)

Revalidation: 42 of 67 patterns (63%) = PASS ✅
```

---

### Step 2: New Discovery Analysis (10-15 min)

**Objective:** Measure how many novel patterns emerged in sample batch (not in strategic_lens.yaml)

**Method:**
```yaml
For each pattern in taxonomy.yaml:
  If discovered_date > sample_batch_start_date:
    pattern_status: "NEW DISCOVERY"
    evidence: [transcript IDs, frequency, severity/priority]

  Categorize by:
    - category (persona, pain_point, objection, etc.)
    - priority (from lens criteria if applicable)
    - strategic_fit_weight (from dimensional scores)
```

**New Discovery Rate Calculation:**
```yaml
baseline_patterns = 67
new_patterns_discovered = [count of patterns with discovered_date in sample batch]

discovery_rate = (new_patterns_discovered / baseline_patterns) × 100%

Pass threshold: ≥20% (≥13 new patterns expected)
```

**Example:**
```yaml
New patterns discovered in sample batch:

Personas:
  - multi-entity-real-estate-buyer (freq 2, priority 1)
  - corporate-accounts-payable-manager (freq 3, priority 1)

Pain Points:
  - vendor-portal-fatigue (freq 2, severity HIGH)
  - multiple-business-entity-reconciliation (freq 1, severity MEDIUM)

Objections:
  - integration-implementation-time (freq 4, severity HIGH)
  - ar-customer-credit-card-reluctance (freq 2, severity CRITICAL)

Product Requirements:
  - bulk-payment-scheduling (freq 3, priority 1)
  - vendor-payment-approval-workflow (freq 2, priority 2)

Competitive Threats:
  - fundbox-invoice-factoring (freq 1, tier 2)

Total new discoveries: 18 patterns
Discovery rate: 18/67 = 27% = PASS ✅
```

---

### Step 3: Quality Assessment (10-15 min)

**Objective:** Measure adherence to attribution standards and strategic_fit calculation

**A. Evidence Preservation Check**

```yaml
For random sample of 20-30 nodes:

  Check context_lineage:
    ✅ source_document present
    ✅ lines_extracted present (line ranges)
    ✅ unique_value explanation present
    ✅ dimensional_annotations present (if from multi-agent extraction)

  Check evidence[]:
    ✅ All evidence items have quotes
    ✅ All evidence has line-level citations (file:line)
    ✅ No UNKNOWN claims without explicit flag
    ✅ No fabricated content (all traceable to source)

evidence_preservation_rate = (nodes_passing / nodes_sampled) × 100%

Pass threshold: ≥90%
```

**B. Strategic Fit Calculation Check**

```yaml
For nodes with strategic_fit scores:

  Check dimensional scores:
    ✅ WHO/WHAT/WHY/HOW/WHERE_WHEN/META scores present (if multi-agent)
    ✅ Composite strategic_fit calculated using weighted formula
    ✅ Reasoning documented for composite score
    ✅ Score matches dimensional inputs (math verification)

  Check score range:
    ✅ All scores between 0.0 and 10.0
    ✅ No scores without evidence
    ✅ Anti-personas correctly scored 0-3

strategic_fit_quality_rate = (nodes_passing / nodes_with_scores) × 100%

Pass threshold: ≥85%
```

**C. Attribution Completeness Check**

```yaml
For all nodes:

  Check frontmatter:
    ✅ node_type present
    ✅ status assigned (emergent/validated/canonical)
    ✅ tags[] present (from taxonomy)
    ✅ strategic_fit OR severity/priority present (domain-appropriate)

  Check content:
    ✅ No orphan nodes (all linked to source transcripts)
    ✅ No duplicate nodes (same concept, different file)
    ✅ Related nodes cross-referenced with [[wiki-links]]

attribution_completeness_rate = (nodes_passing / total_nodes) × 100%

Pass threshold: ≥85%
```

**Quality Score Calculation:**
```yaml
overall_quality = (
  evidence_preservation_rate × 0.40 +
  strategic_fit_quality_rate × 0.35 +
  attribution_completeness_rate × 0.25
)

Pass threshold: ≥85%
```

**Example:**
```yaml
Sample batch quality assessment:

Evidence preservation: 28/30 nodes = 93% ✅
Strategic fit quality: 45/50 nodes = 90% ✅
Attribution completeness: 88/100 nodes = 88% ✅

Overall quality = (93 × 0.40) + (90 × 0.35) + (88 × 0.25)
                = 37.2 + 31.5 + 22.0
                = 90.7% ✅ PASS
```

---

### Step 4: Scaling Decision (5-10 min)

**Decision Matrix:**

```yaml
GO (Proceed to next phase):
  Criteria:
    - Pattern revalidation ≥60%
    - New discovery rate ≥20%
    - Overall quality ≥85%

  Action:
    - Document validation results
    - Archive sample batch nodes
    - Proceed to full corpus processing (Phase 3)
    - Expected outcome: High confidence in lens alignment

NO-GO (Stop and fix):
  Criteria:
    - Pattern revalidation <40% (lens fundamentally misaligned)
    - OR Overall quality <70% (agents not following standards)

  Action:
    - Document failures with specific evidence
    - Identify root causes (lens issues vs agent execution)
    - Do NOT proceed to full corpus
    - Human escalation required

REFINE (Iterate on sample batch):
  Criteria:
    - Pattern revalidation 40-59% (lens needs adjustment)
    - OR New discovery rate <20% (sample not diverse enough)
    - AND Overall quality ≥70% (agents working correctly)

  Action:
    - Document patterns that failed to revalidate
    - Identify lens refinements needed
    - Update strategic_lens.yaml (version bump)
    - Retry sample batch with refined lens (max 3 iterations)
```

### Step 5: Generate Validation Report (10-15 min)

**Output File:** `validation_reports/checkpoint_[N]_validation.md`

**Report Structure:**

```markdown
# Checkpoint [N] Validation Report

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Analyst:** Validation_Analyst v1.0

## Executive Summary

**Decision:** GO | NO-GO | REFINE

**Key Metrics:**
- Pattern Revalidation: [X]% ([threshold: ≥60%])
- New Discovery Rate: [Y]% ([threshold: ≥20%])
- Overall Quality: [Z]% ([threshold: ≥85%])

**Recommendation:** [1-2 sentence summary]

---

## 1. Pattern Revalidation Analysis

**Baseline:** 67 patterns from strategic_lens.yaml v1.1

**Revalidated Patterns:** [X of 67 (Y%)]

## 4. Scaling Decision

**Decision:** GO | NO-GO | REFINE

### Rationale

[Detailed explanation of decision based on three criteria]

**Pattern Revalidation:** [PASS/FAIL with percentage]
- [Analysis of why patterns revalidated or didn't]

**New Discovery Rate:** [PASS/FAIL with percentage]
- [Analysis of discovery patterns]

**Overall Quality:** [PASS/FAIL with percentage]
- [Analysis of quality issues if any]

### Action Items

**If GO:**
- [ ] Archive sample batch validation report
- [ ] Proceed to Phase 3 (full corpus processing)
- [ ] Monitor quality metrics during full corpus
- [ ] Plan Checkpoint 2 validation after full corpus

**If REFINE:**
- [ ] Update strategic_lens.yaml to v[X.Y] with refinements
- [ ] Document lens changes in changelog
- [ ] Select new sample batch (or retry with same transcripts)
- [ ] Re-run dimensional extractors + synthesizer
- [ ] Schedule Iteration [N+1] validation (max 3 iterations)

**If NO-GO:**
- [ ] Escalate to human review
- [ ] Document root cause analysis
- [ ] Determine if lens fundamentally misaligned OR agent execution failure
- [ ] Hold full corpus processing until issues resolved

---

## 5. Lens Refinement Recommendations (If REFINE)

[Only if decision = REFINE]

### Patterns to Add/Update in strategic_lens.yaml

**Add:**
- [New high-priority patterns discovered in sample batch]

**Update:**
- [Patterns with priority/weight adjustments based on sample batch evidence]

**Remove:**
- [Patterns that didn't revalidate and likely outliers]

### Dimensional Scoring Adjustments

[If composite strategic_fit calculations seem off, suggest weight adjustments]

**Example:**
- META dimension weight too low (market segment critical for fit)
  - Current: 15%, Suggested: 20%
  - Reduce: WHERE_WHEN from 10% to 5%

---

## 6. Pattern Stability Analysis

**Taxonomy Health:**
- Total patterns: [baseline + new discoveries]
- Emergent: [count, %]
- Validated: [count, %]
- Canonical: [count, %]

**Status Progression:**
[List patterns that progressed emergent → validated OR validated → canonical]

**Example:**
- `accounting-firm-buyer`: emergent → validated (freq: 1 → 4) ✅
- `quickbooks-integration`: validated → canonical (freq: 4 → 8) ✅

**Stability Score:** [0-100]
```yaml
stability_score = (patterns_revalidated / total_baseline_patterns) × 100

Interpretation:
  85-100: Excellent stability, lens well-aligned
  70-84: Good stability, minor refinements
  60-69: Moderate stability, lens needs updates
  <60: Poor stability, lens misaligned with corpus
```

## Checkpoint 1 vs Checkpoint 2 Differences

### Checkpoint 1 (After Sample Batch)

**Purpose:** Validate lens alignment before scaling to full corpus

**Batch Size:** 10-20 transcripts, 50-100 nodes

**Focus:**
- Pattern revalidation (did Iteration 1 patterns reappear?)
- New discovery (sample diversity validation)
- Quality baseline (are agents following standards?)

**Decision Impact:**
- GO = Proceed to 140-150 remaining transcripts
- REFINE = Update lens, retry sample batch
- NO-GO = Stop, fix fundamental issues

**Risk:** Low (small batch, easy to iterate)

---

### Checkpoint 2 (After Full Corpus)

**Purpose:** Final quality validation before synthesis phase

**Batch Size:** 165 transcripts, 700-1500 nodes

**Focus:**
- Pattern stability (emergent → validated → canonical progression)
- Taxonomy health (tag sprawl, frequency distribution)
- Synthesis readiness (inter-domain connections, rollup preparation)

**Decision Impact:**
- GO = Proceed to Phase 4 (synthesis and strategic rollups)
- REFINE = Minor corrections only (no full re-processing)
- NO-GO = Major quality issues (unlikely at this stage if Checkpoint 1 passed)

**Risk:** High (full corpus processed, expensive to iterate)

---

## Iteration Limits & Escalation

### Maximum Iterations: 3

**Iteration 1:** Initial sample batch with strategic_lens.yaml v1.1
- If PASS → GO to full corpus
- If FAIL → REFINE lens to v1.2

**Iteration 2:** Retry sample batch with strategic_lens.yaml v1.2
- If PASS → GO to full corpus
- If FAIL → REFINE lens to v1.3

**Iteration 3:** Final retry with strategic_lens.yaml v1.3
- If PASS → GO to full corpus
- If FAIL → ESCALATE TO HUMAN

**Escalation Criteria:**
- 3 iterations completed without PASS
- Pattern revalidation <40% after 3 iterations
- Lens fundamentally misaligned with corpus (root cause analysis shows conceptual mismatch)

**Escalation Action:**
- Generate detailed failure report
- Document all iteration attempts and refinements
- Provide hypothesis for misalignment
- Recommend: (a) major lens redesign, OR (b) corpus filtering, OR (c) agent specification changes

---

## Contract Compliance Validation

✅ **MUST HAVE:**
- [ ] Pattern revalidation rate calculated and compared to ≥60% threshold
- [ ] New discovery rate calculated and compared to ≥20% threshold
- [ ] Overall quality score calculated and compared to ≥85% threshold
- [ ] GO/NO-GO/REFINE decision made with evidence
- [ ] Validation report generated with all 6 sections
- [ ] If REFINE: Specific lens refinements documented
- [ ] If NO-GO: Root cause analysis provided
- [ ] Iteration count tracked (max 3)

❌ **MUST NOT:**
- [ ] Make GO decision without meeting all 3 pass thresholds
- [ ] Skip quality sampling (must check 20-30 nodes minimum)
- [ ] Fabricate pattern revalidation (must verify in taxonomy.yaml)
- [ ] Exceed 3 iterations without human escalation
- [ ] Make REFINE decision without specific lens refinement recommendations

---

## Critical Flags (Auto-escalate to Human)

**Flag if:**
- Pattern revalidation <40% (lens fundamentally misaligned)
- Overall quality <70% (agents not following standards)
- 3 iterations completed without PASS (exhausted retry limit)
- Contradictory signals: high revalidation but low discovery, OR high discovery but low revalidation (corpus sampling issue)
- Evidence preservation <80% (systematic attribution failure)

---
