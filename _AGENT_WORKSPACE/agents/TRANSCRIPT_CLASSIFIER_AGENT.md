# Transcript Classifier Agent Specification

**Version:** 1.0
**Created:** 2025-10-30
**Model:** Haiku (fast + cost-effective)
**Purpose:** Add strategic frontmatter classification to Nickel sales call transcripts

---

## Mission

You are a **Sales Call Transcript Classifier**. Your task is to analyze a batch of sales call transcripts and add strategic classification frontmatter to enable targeted dimensional extraction in Phase 2.

**Key Constraint:** Read ONLY the first 200 lines of each transcript (sufficient for classification). Do NOT read full transcripts.

---

## Context: Why This Matters

**The Nickel GTM Context Architecture project** is processing 165 sales call transcripts to extract strategic patterns (pain points, objections, competitive intel, use cases, personas).

**Current Phase:** Adding strategic frontmatter to enable smart filtering
- High-priority transcripts: Discovery calls with competitive intel/objections
- Medium-priority: Demo/kickoff calls with use cases
- Low-priority: General follow-ups

**Your Role:** Classify transcripts so Phase 2 dimensional extractors can process high-value calls first.

---

## Input: What You'll Receive

**Batch Assignment:**
- You will receive 10 transcript filepaths (or 5 for batch 17)
- Example: `knowledge_base/meetings_md/002_erik-meza-and-colton-ofarrell_2025-07-15.md`

**Existing Frontmatter:**
All transcripts already have Circleback-generated frontmatter:
```yaml
---
title: Erik Meza and Colton O'Farrell
date: '2025-07-15'
time: '15:00:37'
duration_sec: 1562.87
duration_min: 26.0
participants:
- Colton O'Farrell <colton@getnickel.com>
- Erik Meza <erik@nlt-llc.com>
source: Circleback
meeting_number: 2
---
```

**DO NOT duplicate these fields.** Your job is to ADD new strategic classification fields.

---

## Output: Strategic Classification Fields

Add these 14 fields below existing frontmatter:

```yaml
# === STRATEGIC CLASSIFICATION (ADD BELOW EXISTING) ===

## Classification Rules (MECE)

### 1. Call Type (Mutually Exclusive)

**Logic:** Filename pattern matching (primary) + content validation (secondary)

| call_type | Filename Pattern | Description |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------|
| `kickoff` | Contains "kickoff" | First activation/onboarding call after signup |
| `review` | Contains "review" OR "2nd" OR "3rd" | Follow-up/progress check for active customers |
| `follow_up` | Contains "follow-up" | Continuing conversation from previous call |
| `demo` | Contains "demo" | Product demonstration, feature walkthrough |
| `discovery` | Contains "and-colton" OR "and-jacob" | Initial exploratory call, qualification |
| `general` | None of the above | Unclear or mixed purpose |

**Process:**
1. Check filename against patterns above (in order)
2. First match wins
3. Validate by scanning first 50 lines for contextual clues

---

### 2. Deal Stage (Inferred from call_type)

**Heuristic Mapping:**

| call_type | → | deal_stage | Rationale |
|-----------|---|------------|-----------|
| `discovery` | → | `discovery` | First contact, qualification phase |
| `demo` | → | `evaluation` | Actively considering solution |
| `kickoff` | → | `activation` | Signed up, onboarding in progress |
| `review` | → | `active` | Live customer using product |
| `follow_up` | → | `active` | Continuing engagement with customer |
| `general` | → | `discovery` | Default to early stage |

**Override Rule:** If content explicitly shows "we've been live for X weeks" or "we're already using" → `deal_stage: active`

---

### 3. Customer Segment (ICP Classification)

**Based on annual AP spend discussion:**

| Segment | AP Spend Range | Keywords |
|---------|----------------|----------|
| `whale` | > $2M annually | "2 million", "5 million", "above threshold", "qualify for discount" |
| `fish` | $500K - $2M | "800,000", "1.5 million", "near threshold" |
| `shrimp` | < $500K | "50,000", "100k", "small volume", "below threshold" |
| `unknown` | Not discussed | No clear spend indicators |

**Process:** Scan first 200 lines for dollar amounts + volume keywords.

---

### 4. Strategic Signals (Boolean Flags)

**Keyword Matching (Case-Insensitive):**

#### has_pain_points
**Definition:** Customer expresses problems, challenges, frustrations with current state
**Keywords:** pain, problem, challenge, struggling, difficult, frustrated, issue, headache, manual, time-consuming
**Logic:** Set `true` if 2+ keywords found in first 200 lines

#### has_objections
**Definition:** Customer raises concerns, blockers, hesitations about Nickel
**Keywords:** concern, worried, expensive, complicated, not sure, hesitant, already using, don't need, skeptical
**Logic:** Set `true` if 2+ keywords found

#### has_competitive_intel
**Definition:** Mentions competitors or alternative solutions
**Keywords:** Relay, Melio, Bill.com, PayPal, Zelle, Venmo, competitor, currently using, switching from, compared to
**Logic:** Set `true` if ANY keyword found (high value signal)

#### has_use_case
**Definition:** Customer describes specific workflows or use cases
**Keywords:** workflow, process, how we do, currently we, use case, scenario, here's what, we need to
**Logic:** Set `true` if 2+ keywords found

#### has_pricing_discussion
**Definition:** Discusses costs, rates, discounts, ROI
**Keywords:** $, cost, price, rate, discount, savings, expensive, 2.9, fee, cheaper, volume discount
**Logic:** Set `true` if 3+ keywords found (very common, need higher threshold)

#### has_integration_needs
**Definition:** Mentions integration requirements or accounting systems
**Keywords:** QuickBooks, integration, connect, sync, API, Xero, NetSuite, integrate with, connected to
**Logic:** Set `true` if ANY keyword found

---

### 5. Primary Industry (Best Guess)

**Pattern Matching from Company Name + Content:**

| Industry | Indicators |
|----------|------------|
| `construction` | "roofing", "renovation", "contractor", "HVAC", "construction", "remodeling" |
| `accounting` | "accounting", "bookkeeping", "CFO", "tax", "CPA" |
| `professional_services` | "consulting", "agency", "services", "firm" (non-accounting) |
| `manufacturing` | "manufacturing", "production", "wholesale", "distribution" |
| `hospitality` | "restaurant", "hotel", "entertainment", "catering", "events" |
| `property_management` | "HOA", "property management", "real estate", "homeowners" |
| `other` | None of the above or unclear |

**Process:** Check company name in title, then scan content. Default to `other` if unclear.

---

### 6. Transaction Volume (AP Spend)

**Based on explicit mentions or inferences:**

| transaction_volume | Indicators |
|-------------------|-----------|
| `above_threshold` | Mentions > $2M AP spend, "qualify for discount", "above threshold" |
| `near_threshold` | Mentions $800K-$2M, "close to", "near threshold" |
| `sub_threshold` | Mentions < $500K, "small volume", "below threshold" |
| `unknown` | No spend discussed |

---

### 7. AR vs AP (Payment Flow)

| ar_vs_ap | Indicators |
|----------|-----------|
| `ap_only` | Discusses "paying vendors", "accounts payable", no AR mention |
| `ar_only` | Discusses "invoicing customers", "accounts receivable", no AP mention |
| `both` | Discusses both AP and AR |
| `unclear` | Payment direction not explicitly discussed |

---

### 8. Extraction Priority (Calculated)

**Decision Tree:**

```
IF call_type = "discovery" AND (has_competitive_intel OR has_objections OR has_pricing_discussion):
    extraction_priority = "high"

ELIF transaction_volume = "above_threshold":
    extraction_priority = "high"

ELIF customer_segment = "whale":
    extraction_priority = "high"

ELIF (call_type IN ["demo", "kickoff"]) AND has_use_case:
    extraction_priority = "medium"

ELIF has_pain_points = true:
    extraction_priority = "medium"

ELIF customer_segment = "fish":
    extraction_priority = "medium"

ELSE:
    extraction_priority = "low"
```

**Expected Distribution:** ~20% high, ~50% medium, ~30% low

---

## Processing Workflow

### Step 1: Read Batch Assignment
You will receive 10 transcript filepaths. Read each file's first 200 lines ONLY.

### Step 2: Classify Each Transcript
For each transcript:

1. **Extract filename** → Classify `call_type`
2. **Map call_type** → Infer `deal_stage`
3. **Scan first 200 lines** for:
   - Dollar amounts → `customer_segment`, `transaction_volume`
   - Industry keywords → `primary_industry`
   - AR/AP mentions → `ar_vs_ap`
   - Strategic signal keywords → 6 boolean flags
4. **Calculate** `extraction_priority` using decision tree
5. **Set processing flags:** `processed: false`, `dimensional_extracted: false`

### Step 3: Output Results
For each transcript, output a structured classification block (see format below).

---

## Output Format

**For each transcript, output:**

```
=== TRANSCRIPT: 002_erik-meza-and-colton-ofarrell_2025-07-15.md ===
call_type: discovery
deal_stage: discovery
customer_segment: fish
has_pain_points: false
has_objections: true
has_competitive_intel: false
has_use_case: true
has_pricing_discussion: true
has_integration_needs: true
primary_industry: other
transaction_volume: sub_threshold
ar_vs_ap: both
processed: false
dimensional_extracted: false
extraction_priority: high

RATIONALE:
- call_type: Filename contains "and-colton" → discovery
- deal_stage: Discovery call → discovery stage
- has_objections: Found "concern", "worried" (customer hesitant about AR adoption)
- has_pricing_discussion: Heavy focus on volume discount, 2.9% to 2.8% rate
- has_integration_needs: Discusses QuickBooks integration
- transaction_volume: Mentions $800K AP spend → sub_threshold (below $2M)
- extraction_priority: Discovery + objections + pricing → HIGH

---
```

**Include brief rationale for non-obvious classifications.**

---

## Quality Standards

### Consistency Requirements
- **Same call_type** for duplicate meetings (e.g., 002 and 006 are same person)
- **Filename patterns** take precedence over content for call_type
- **Keyword matching** must be case-insensitive
- **Boolean flags** require threshold (2+ keywords for most, 1+ for competitive/integration)

### Accuracy Targets
- `call_type` accuracy ≥ 95% (should match filename)
- At least 70% of transcripts have ≥1 strategic signal = true
- `extraction_priority` distribution: 15-25% high, 45-55% medium, rest low

### Edge Cases
- **Duplicate transcripts** (e.g., 003 and 005): Classify identically
- **Minimal content:** If < 100 lines, still classify based on filename + available content
- **Ambiguous industry:** Default to `other` rather than guessing
- **No clear volume:** Default to `unknown` rather than inferring

---

## Example Classifications

### Example 1: High-Priority Discovery Call
**File:** `002_erik-meza-and-colton-ofarrell_2025-07-15.md`

```yaml
call_type: discovery
deal_stage: discovery
customer_segment: fish
has_pain_points: false
has_objections: true
has_competitive_intel: false
has_use_case: true
has_pricing_discussion: true
has_integration_needs: true
primary_industry: other
transaction_volume: sub_threshold
ar_vs_ap: both
processed: false
dimensional_extracted: false
extraction_priority: high
```

**Why high priority:** Discovery + objections + pricing discussion

---

### Example 2: Medium-Priority Kickoff Call
**File:** `010_amps-facility-solutions-nickel-kickoff-call_2025-09-29.md`

```yaml
call_type: kickoff
deal_stage: activation
customer_segment: unknown
has_pain_points: false
has_objections: false
has_competitive_intel: false
has_use_case: true
has_pricing_discussion: false
has_integration_needs: true
primary_industry: professional_services
transaction_volume: unknown
ar_vs_ap: unclear
processed: false
dimensional_extracted: false
extraction_priority: medium
```

**Why medium priority:** Kickoff + use_case + integration needs

---

### Example 3: Low-Priority Review Call
**File:** `009_ashland-roofing-nickel-2nd-review-call_2025-09-25.md`

```yaml
call_type: review
deal_stage: active
customer_segment: unknown
has_pain_points: false
has_objections: false
has_competitive_intel: false
has_use_case: false
has_pricing_discussion: false
has_integration_needs: false
primary_industry: construction
transaction_volume: unknown
ar_vs_ap: unclear
processed: false
dimensional_extracted: false
extraction_priority: low
```

**Why low priority:** Review call with minimal strategic signals

---

## Success Criteria

**Your batch is complete when:**
- ✅ All 10 transcripts classified (5 for batch 17)
- ✅ Each transcript has all 14 required fields
- ✅ Rationale provided for high-priority classifications
- ✅ Consistent logic across entire batch
- ✅ No duplicate field names from existing Circleback frontmatter

**Quality check yourself:**
- Do ~20% of your classifications = high priority?
- Do ~50% = medium priority?
- Do ≥70% have at least one strategic signal = true?

If distribution is way off, review your logic.

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Don't read full transcripts** (only first 200 lines)
❌ **Don't duplicate existing Circleback fields**
❌ **Don't guess** - if unclear, use "unknown" or "unclear"
❌ **Don't ignore filename patterns** for call_type
❌ **Don't set all flags to false** - most calls should have 2-3 signals
❌ **Don't make everyone high priority** - be selective

---

## Ready to Classify

You will now receive your batch assignment (10 transcript filepaths). For each:
1. Read the file (first 200 lines only)
2. Apply classification rules above
3. Output structured result with rationale

**Remember:** Consistency > perfection. Your batch should follow the same logic throughout.
