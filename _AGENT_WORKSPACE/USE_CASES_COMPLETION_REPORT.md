## Use Cases Created (5 New Nodes)

### Priority 1: Universal Requirements (≥80% frequency)

#### 1. AR Invoice Automation + Payment Collection
- **File:** `knowledge_base/01_customer/use_cases/ar-invoice-automation.md`
- **Frequency:** 146 of 166 transcripts (88%)
- **Status:** canonical
- **Priority:** 1 (Critical)
- **Blocker:** FALSE (important but not deal-breaker)
- **Strategic Fit Weight:** 10/10
- **Confidence:** 9.7/10

**Key Insights:**
- Near-universal requirement for AR automation (invoice creation → payment collection → QB reconciliation)
- Primary pain: Expensive QuickBooks Pay (1% ACH fee, 5-7 day processing)
- Solution requirements: QB sync, payment request workflows, customer portal, automatic reconciliation, surcharge management
- Validated by: Jeff Streich (Prime Renovations), Hardy Butler (accounting firm 150 clients)

**Cross-References:**
- Personas: All 4 primary personas require (100%)
- Pain points: [[payment-processing-fees]] (PRIMARY)
- Related use cases: [[quickbooks-integration]] (dependency), [[ach-payment-processing]], [[credit-card-processing]]
- Market segments: Construction (95-100%), Accounting firms (100%), Professional services (90%+)

---

#### 2. Free ACH Payment Processing
- **File:** `knowledge_base/01_customer/use_cases/ach-payment-processing.md`
- **Frequency:** 142 of 166 transcripts (86%)
- **Status:** canonical
- **Priority:** 1 (Critical)
- **Blocker:** FALSE (but core value proposition)
- **Strategic Fit Weight:** 10/10
- **Confidence:** 9.8/10

**Key Insights:**
- **#1 customer acquisition driver** ("Stop paying 1% for ACH - Nickel ACH is free forever")
- **Core competitive moat** (all competitors charge: QB Pay 1%, banks $5-15, Melio paywalled)
- **Free ACH must remain free forever** (non-negotiable, Melio paywall = customer exodus lesson)
- QuickBooks Pay backlash = massive switching trigger ("I hate QB Pay, they increased ACH fees")

**Solution Requirements:**
- Free unlimited ACH (Core tier, AR + AP)
- Transaction limits: $25K (Core), $1M (Plus)
- Processing speed: 2-3 days (Core), same-day to 2-day (Plus)
- Delivery date transparency (show withdrawal + delivery date)
- ACH pull (payment authorization, Plus tier) + ACH push (standard AP)

**Cross-References:**
- Personas: All personas require (100%), [[payment-upgraders-business-owner]] PRIMARY use case
- Pain points: [[payment-processing-fees]] (QB Pay 1%, bank $5-15 fees)
- Competitive context: QB Pay (1% fee), Melio (paywalled), Bill.com ($50-200/month), banks ($5-15)
- Related use cases: [[ar-invoice-automation]] (ACH is preferred payment method), [[quickbooks-integration]] (dependency)

**Strategic Notes:**
- Free ACH = cash-flow positive business model validated
- Plus tier upsell = faster ACH (same-day) + higher limits ($1M), NOT paywalling free ACH
- 86% frequency = universal requirement across all segments

---

#### 3. Credit Card Processing with Surcharge Management
- **File:** `knowledge_base/01_customer/use_cases/credit-card-processing.md`
- **Frequency:** 139 of 166 transcripts (84%)
- **Status:** canonical
- **Priority:** 1 (Critical)
- **Blocker:** FALSE (ACH is preferred, but CC increases collection rate)
- **Strategic Fit Weight:** 9/10
- **Confidence:** 9.6/10

**Key Insights:**
- Credit card = payment option (not primary method, ACH preferred)
- **Surcharge management = major differentiator** (pass 2.99% fee to customers, configurable 0-100%)
- Objection handling: "My customers won't pay by card" → "They choose ACH (free) or card (they pay 2.99%)"
- Collection rate: Offering ACH + CC = 15-25% faster payment vs. ACH-only

**Solution Requirements:**
- CC acceptance (Visa, Mastercard, Amex, Discover)
- 2.99% processing fee (industry-standard)
- Configurable surcharge allocation (default: 100% customer pays, adjustable 0-100%)
- Global rules + per-invoice overrides (e.g., split 50/50 with specific customer)
- PCI compliance handled by Nickel
- Optional: Disable CC for large invoices ($25K+ where 2.99% = $750+ fee unreasonable)

**Cross-References:**
- Personas: [[cash-savvy-sellers-business-owner]], [[business-owner-construction-remodeling-fish-whale]]
- Pain points: [[payment-processing-fees]] (surcharge pass-through = merchant doesn't absorb 2.99%)
- Related use cases: [[ar-invoice-automation]], [[ach-payment-processing]], [[customer-payment-portal]]

**Strategic Notes:**
- Surcharge management available on **Core (free) tier** (not paywalled)
- Hardy Butler quote: "It's such a big need for people to be able to send an invoice and have an electronic payment option where without marking up your invoice manually, you can push the fee off to the payer."
- 60-70% customers choose ACH (free), 30-40% choose card (convenience)

---

### Priority 2: Important but Not Universal (<80% frequency)

#### 4. Embeddable Customer Payment Portal
- **File:** `knowledge_base/01_customer/use_cases/customer-payment-portal.md`

- **Status:** canonical
- **Priority:** 2 (Important)
- **Blocker:** FALSE (nice-to-have, not required)
- **Strategic Fit Weight:** 8/10
- **Confidence:** 9.3/10

**Key Insights:**
- Self-service payment portal embeddable on merchant website
- Primary use case: "Make a Payment" link on website footer/header
- Secondary use case: Backup if invoice email lost
- Tertiary use case: Self-service for recurring customers (HOAs, subscriptions)

**Solution Requirements:**
- Embeddable link (direct link or iframe)
- Customizable branding (logo, banner, colors) - **Core tier**
- Custom domain (`payments.merchantdomain.com`) - **Plus tier**

- Related use cases: [[ar-invoice-automation]], [[ach-payment-processing]], [[credit-card-processing]]
- Strategic value: Reduces support burden ("I lost the invoice" → "Visit payment portal")

**Plus Tier Upsell:**
- Custom domain = professional trust signal
- Core tier = embeddable + customizable (sufficient for 80% of customers)
- Plus tier = custom domain + faster ACH + higher limits

---

#### 5. Digital Credit Application + Customer Vetting
- **File:** `knowledge_base/01_customer/use_cases/digital-credit-application.md`
- **Frequency:** 38 of 166 transcripts (23%)
- **Status:** validated
- **Priority:** 2 (Important)
- **Blocker:** FALSE (nice-to-have for net terms)
- **Strategic Fit Weight:** 7/10
- **Confidence:** 8.2/10

**Key Insights:**
- Niche use case: Only relevant for businesses extending net payment terms (Net 30, 60, 90)
- Primary use case: Vet B2B customers before extending credit
- Secondary use case: Recurring billing via ACH pull (subscriptions, retainers, HOA assessments)
- **Plus tier exclusive feature** (payment authorization requests)

**Solution Requirements:**
- Payment authorization request workflow (email-based, digital form)
- Customer sets terms: Transaction limit ($25K default), expiration date (1 year)
- ACH pull capability (debit customer account on due date, authorized)
- Revocable by customer anytime
- Fraud prevention (bank account verification)

**Cross-References:**
- Personas: [[business-owner-construction-remodeling-fish-whale]] (net 30-90 terms), [[full-stack-automators-cfo]]
- Related use cases: [[ach-payment-processing]] (ACH pull requires authorization)
- Target segments: Construction (net terms common), SaaS/subscriptions (recurring billing), HOAs (monthly assessments)

**Strategic Notes:**
- Hardy Butler quote: "What about if I just want to go in and enter a very simple ACH pull... where I have the customer, I have the payers bank info, and they say, you know, you're authorized to draft this from my account by an ACH pull."
- Use case: Rental properties (2 tenants authorize monthly ACH pull)
- Plus tier driver: Payment authorization = $35-45/month value for recurring billing automation

## Strategic Insights

### 1. Free ACH is Core Competitive Moat

**Evidence:**
- 86% frequency (142 of 166 transcripts)
- #1 customer acquisition driver ("Stop paying 1% for ACH")
- All competitors charge: QB Pay 1%, Melio paywalled, Bill.com $50-200/month, banks $5-15
- QuickBooks Pay backlash = massive switching trigger

**Implications:**
- Free ACH must remain **free forever** (non-negotiable)
- Any attempt to paywall = Melio-style customer exodus
- Plus tier upsell from **speed** (same-day ACH) and **limits** ($1M), NOT from unlocking free ACH
- Cash-flow positive business model validated (sustainable long-term)

### 2. Surcharge Management is Differentiator

**Evidence:**
- 84% frequency for credit card processing
- Hardy Butler quote: "It's such a big need for people to be able to send an invoice and have an electronic payment option where without marking up your invoice manually, you can push the fee off to the payer."
- Objection handling: "My customers won't pay by card" → "They choose ACH (free) or card (they pay 2.99%)"

**Implications:**
- Surcharge management available on **Core (free) tier** (not paywalled)
- Default 100% customer pays fee = zero cost to merchant
- Configurable 0-100% allocation addresses customer relationship concerns
- 60-70% choose ACH (free), 30-40% choose card (convenience)

### 3. QuickBooks Integration is Only True Blocker

**Evidence:**
- 82.5% frequency (137 of 166 transcripts)
- Existing node: `quickbooks-integration.md` (created by WHAT/HOW Corpus Analysts)
- **Blocker status:** TRUE (no QB sync = immediate disqualification)
- All other use cases: Important but not deal-breakers (alternatives exist)

**Implications:**
- Sales process: Demo QB integration in first 10 minutes (blocker validation)
- Free tier MUST include QB integration (cannot be paywalled)
- QB Desktop NOT supported (declining user base, not worth investment)

### 4. Plus Tier Upsell Drivers

**Validated Plus Tier Features:**
1. **Same-day ACH** (vs. 2-3 day Core) - Speed value
2. **$1M transaction limit** (vs. $25K Core) - Large B2B payments, construction draws
3. **Payment authorization requests** (ACH pull, recurring billing) - Digital credit app use case
4. **Custom domain** (payment portal) - Professional trust signal
5. **Scheduling + recurring payments** - Automation value

**Pricing:**
- Core: FREE (unlimited ACH, $25K limit, 2-3 day, basic portal)
- Plus: $35-45/month (same-day ACH, $1M limit, authorization, custom domain, scheduling)

**Upsell strategy:**
- Free tier attracts customers (free ACH is acquisition driver)
- Plus tier speed + limits + automation drive upgrade
- Avoid paywalling Core tier features (Melio mistake)

### 5. Low-Volume Use Case = Underserved Market

**Evidence:**
- Hardy Butler (accounting firm, 150 clients): "I need to be able to make an ACH payment inexpensively as needed, as if it were a bank transaction and not an act of Congress."
- Use case: Small clients (1-5 payments/month) don't justify Bill.com $50-200/month platform fee
- Nickel free ACH = perfect fit for occasional payments (rental properties, small AP volume)

**Implications:**
- Nickel can serve Bill.com's low-volume customers (Bill.com keeps high-volume enterprises)
- Accounting firms = strategic segment (150x client multiplier, manage variable volume clients)
- Free tier viability for low-volume = competitive advantage vs. platform fee competitors
