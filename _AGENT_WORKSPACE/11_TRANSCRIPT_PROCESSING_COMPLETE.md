## Technical Achievements

### Multi-Format Parsing Success

Successfully handled **6 different agent output formats**:

1. **Format 1:** `=== TRANSCRIPT: filename.md ===` (Batches 2, 5, 10, 13, 15)
2. **Format 2:** `### TRANSCRIPT NNN:` with numbered format (Batch 1)
3. **Format 3:** `### N. TRANSCRIPT: filename.md` with YAML blocks (Batch 3)
4. **Format 4:** `## TRANSCRIPT: filename.md` with bold fields (Batches 4, 12)
5. **Format 5:** `## TRANSCRIPT NNN: Name` with Filename field (Batch 6)
6. **Format 6:** `### Transcript N: filename.md` (Batch 7, 17)

**Parser Adaptability:** Created resilient multi-strategy parser that successfully extracted 115 classifications despite format variations.

### Agent Output Files

**17 Batch Result Files Created:**
- Location: `_AGENT_WORKSPACE/transcript_batches/batch_01_results.md` through `batch_17_results.md`
- Size: 15-23 KB per file (avg 18 KB)
- Format: Detailed classifications with rationales
- Quality: All agents followed MECE classification rules

## Known Issues & Mitigations

### Issue 1: Multiple Merge Runs
**Problem:** Some transcripts received duplicate strategic classification blocks
**Affected:** Unknown count (sample shows duplicates)
**Severity:** Medium (cosmetic, doesn't break functionality)
**Mitigation:**
- Can be resolved with deduplication script
- OR files can be manually cleaned
- OR frontmatter can be re-merged with dedup logic

### Issue 2: Partial Format Coverage
**Problem:** 50 transcripts' classifications not parsed (batches 8, 9, 11, 14, 16)
**Root Cause:** Additional format variants not yet handled by parser
**Severity:** Medium
**Mitigation:**
- Agent result files contain complete data
- Can add 2-3 more parsing strategies to cover remaining formats
- Estimated 30 minutes to complete

### Issue 3: One Missing File
**Problem:** `100_christian-ashley-nickel-str-management_2025-10-02.md` not found
**Severity:** Low (1 file out of 165)
**Mitigation:** Verify file exists or was renamed

### Improvements for Next Time
üí° **Single output format enforcement** - Provide exact template in agent spec
üí° **Dedup logic in merger** - Check if classification already exists before appending
üí° **Progress tracking** - Real-time dashboard for agent completion status
üí° **Automated validation** - Run quality checks immediately after merge
