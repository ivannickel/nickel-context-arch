# Undiscovered Agent Orchestration Patterns

**First-Principles Analysis of Orchestration Patterns Not Yet Documented**

---

## Methodology

**Approach**: Identify gaps in existing patterns through dimensional analysis

**Existing Patterns**:
1. Sequential Cascade (linear, time-based)
2. Domain Graph (spatial, knowledge-based)
3. Research→Code (vertical, layer-based)

**Dimensions Not Fully Explored**:
- Parallel/concurrent execution
- Feedback loops & iteration
- Probabilistic/stochastic routing
- Adaptive/learning orchestration
- Event-driven/reactive patterns
- Hierarchical decomposition
- Constraint-based orchestration

---

## Pattern 4: Parallel Fanout-Fanin

**Status**: UNDISCOVERED (implicitly used but not formalized)

### Architecture
```
                    ┌─→ Agent A1 ─┐
                    │              │
Input Context ──────┼─→ Agent A2 ──┼─→ Synthesis Agent → Output
                    │              │
                    └─→ Agent A3 ─┘

Fanout: Split context to multiple independent agents
Fanin: Aggregate results into synthesis
```

### Key Characteristics

**Concurrent Execution**:
- Multiple agents process SAME input context from different perspectives
- No inter-agent dependencies (true parallelism)
- Synthesis agent consolidates outputs

**Dimensional Decomposition**:
- Each parallel agent analyzes one dimension (structural, functional, temporal)
- Same input, orthogonal outputs
- Reduces total execution time by N (number of parallel agents)

**Example Use Case**: Meta-analysis Wave 1
- Agent 01: Structural Taxonomy (directory patterns)
- Agent 02: Role & Contract Extraction (functional patterns)
- Agent 03: Attribution Comparator (evidence patterns)

All analyze SAME 3 case studies but extract DIFFERENT dimensions

### When to Use

**Optimal For**:
- Multi-dimensional analysis of same input
- Time-sensitive deliverables (parallel reduces latency)
- Independent perspectives needed (avoid bias from sequential priming)
- Compute resources available for parallelism

**Design Principles**:
1. **True Independence**: Agents must not need each other's outputs
2. **Synthesis Layer**: Mandatory fanin agent to consolidate
3. **Conflict Resolution**: Synthesis must handle contradictions
4. **Dimension Orthogonality**: Parallel agents analyze different aspects

## Pattern 5: Iterative Refinement Loop

**Status**: UNDISCOVERED (execution exists in Pixee refactor, but pattern not abstracted)

### Architecture
```
Input Context
    ↓
┌───────────────────────────────┐
│ Agent: Analyze & Propose      │
│   ↓                          │
│ Validation Gate              │
│   ↓                          │
│ Quality < Threshold?         │
│   ├─ YES → Refine & Re-run  │◄── Feedback Loop
│   └─ NO → Output             │
└───────────────────────────────┘
```

### Key Characteristics

**Quality-Gated Iteration**:
- Agent executes, evaluates own output quality
- If below threshold, identifies gaps and re-runs with refinement
- Maximum iteration limit prevents infinite loops

**Self-Improving Agents**:
- Agent maintains "learning" context across iterations
- Each iteration explicitly addresses previous gaps
- Final output includes iteration history (transparency)

**Example Use Case**: Context Graph Compression
```
Iteration 1: Consolidate 150 files → 80 files (quality: 70%, missing key insights)
    ↓ [Gap: Customer intelligence dispersed across files]
Iteration 2: Re-consolidate with customer focus → 65 files (quality: 85%, some redundancy)
    ↓ [Gap: Duplicate messaging frameworks]
Iteration 3: Final consolidation → 60 files (quality: 95%, meets threshold)
    ↓ [Output accepted]
```

### When to Use

**Optimal For**:
- Tasks with measurable quality criteria
- Acceptable latency for iterations (not real-time)
- Incremental improvement possible (not binary success/failure)
- Output quality more important than speed

**Design Principles**:
1. **Explicit Quality Metrics**: Define measurable threshold (e.g., 60% file reduction, 100% insight preservation)
2. **Gap Identification**: Each iteration documents what needs improvement
3. **Iteration Limit**: Prevent infinite loops (max 3-5 iterations)
4. **Transparency**: Final output includes iteration history

---

## Pattern 6: Probabilistic Router

**Status**: UNDISCOVERED (routing exists in [Tool]/Recur messaging, but not formalized as orchestration pattern)

### Architecture
```
Input → Classification Agent → Route by Probability
                                    ↓
                    ┌───────────────┼───────────────┐
                    │               │               │
                High Confidence  Medium          Low Confidence
                    ↓               ↓               ↓
            Specialist Agent  Generalist Agent  Human Review
```

### Key Characteristics

**Confidence-Based Routing**:
- Classification agent assigns confidence scores
- High confidence → automated specialist agent
- Low confidence → human-in-the-loop
- Medium confidence → generalist agent with validation

**Adaptive Thresholds**:
- Thresholds adjust based on historical accuracy
- If specialist agent frequently wrong on 80%+ confidence → raise threshold to 90%

**Example Use Case**: Customer Pain Point Classification
```
Input: Customer feedback text

Classification Agent:
- Pain = "Manual data entry" (confidence: 95%) → Route to Efficiency Specialist
- Pain = "Compliance difficulty" (confidence: 60%) → Route to Generalist + Human Review
- Pain = Unclear (confidence: 30%) → Route to Human Analysis
```

### When to Use

**Optimal For**:
- Variable input quality (some clear, some ambiguous)
- Specialist agents exist for known cases
- Graceful degradation needed (don't fail on edge cases)
- Human oversight desired for low-confidence decisions

**Design Principles**:
1. **Explicit Confidence Scores**: Classification agent must output probability
2. **Multiple Routes**: Specialist, generalist, human paths
3. **Threshold Tuning**: Monitor accuracy and adjust routing thresholds
4. **Audit Trail**: Track routing decisions for improvement

## Pattern 7: Hierarchical Decomposition

**Status**: UNDISCOVERED (implicit in L0-L6 layers, but not formalized as recursive pattern)

### Architecture
```
Master Agent: Decompose task into subtasks
    ↓
┌────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Subtask 1 │ Subtask 2 │ Subtask 3 │
│     ↓     │     ↓     │     ↓     │
│  Sub-sub  │  Sub-sub  │  Sub-sub  │  ← Recursive decomposition
└────────────────────────────────────┘
    ↓
Synthesis Agent: Reassemble results
```

### Key Characteristics

**Recursive Task Breakdown**:
- Master agent determines if task is atomic or decomposable
- If decomposable → spawn sub-agents for each subtask
- Sub-agents may further decompose (recursive)
- Leaf agents execute atomic tasks

**Dynamic Depth**:
- Decomposition depth not fixed (adapts to task complexity)
- Simple tasks = 1 level, complex = 3+ levels
- Stop condition: Task is atomic OR max depth reached

**Example Use Case**: Enterprise Account Research
```
Master: Research Company X
    ↓
├─ Product Understanding
│   ├─ Value proposition extraction
│   ├─ Feature catalog
│   └─ Pricing signals
│
├─ Customer Analysis
│   ├─ Case study mining
│   ├─ Review sentiment
│   └─ Customer segmentation
│
└─ Competitive Positioning
    ├─ Direct competitors
    ├─ Differentiation claims
    └─ Market category
```

### When to Use

**Optimal For**:
- Complex, multi-faceted tasks
- Unknown task complexity upfront
- Need for dynamic scaling (simple vs complex inputs)
- Clear task decomposition logic exists

**Design Principles**:
1. **Atomicity Test**: Define what makes a task atomic (can't decompose further)
2. **Max Depth Limit**: Prevent runaway recursion (3-5 levels typical)
3. **Reassembly Logic**: Master agent must know how to combine sub-results
4. **Load Balancing**: Distribute subtasks across available compute

---

## Pattern 8: Event-Driven Reactive

**Status**: UNDISCOVERED (no reactive patterns observed in case studies)

### Architecture
```
Event Stream (new data, user actions, external triggers)
    ↓
Event Router
    ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ Event Type A → Agent Handler A │
│ Event Type B → Agent Handler B │
│ Event Type C → Agent Handler C │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Key Characteristics

**Trigger-Based Execution**:
- Agents don't run on schedule, run on events
- Events: New customer added, competitor launches product, GTM metric drops
- Reactive vs. batch processing

**Stateful Agents**:
- Agents maintain state between event invocations
- Example: "Competitor monitor" agent tracks last-seen state, only alerts on changes

**Example Use Case**: GTM Intelligence Monitoring
```
Events:
- New customer case study published → Trigger "Customer Intelligence Update" agent
- Competitor raises funding → Trigger "Competitive Repositioning" agent
- Win rate drops 10% → Trigger "GTM Diagnostic" agent
- New job posting detected → Trigger "Hiring Signal Analyzer" agent
```

### When to Use

**Optimal For**:
- Continuous monitoring systems (not one-time analysis)
- Resource efficiency (don't run agents when nothing changed)
- Real-time response needed
- External data sources (APIs, webhooks, feeds)

**Design Principles**:
1. **Event Schema**: Define clear event types and payloads
2. **Idempotency**: Agents handle duplicate events gracefully
3. **State Management**: Agents persist state between invocations
4. **Backpressure**: Handle event bursts (queue, rate limit, prioritize)

---

## Pattern 9: Constraint-Based Orchestration

**Status**: UNDISCOVERED (constraints exist implicitly, not formalized as orchestration)

### Architecture
```
Task Graph with Constraints:
- Agent A requires: Input X, <2GB memory, <5 min runtime
- Agent B requires: Agent A output, GPU available
- Agent C requires: Agent A or Agent B complete, weekday hours only

Orchestrator:
1. Evaluate constraints
2. Schedule agents based on resource availability + dependencies
3. Optimize for cost, latency, or quality
```

### Key Characteristics

**Multi-Constraint Optimization**:
- Dependencies (Agent B needs Agent A output)
- Resources (CPU, memory, GPU, API quota)
- Time (business hours, SLA deadlines)
- Cost (cheaper agents when budget limited)
- Quality (faster agents when latency critical)

**Dynamic Scheduling**:
- Orchestrator makes runtime decisions based on current state
- Example: If GPU available → run high-quality image agent, else → run CPU fallback

**Example Use Case**: Multi-Agent Research Pipeline
```
Constraints:
- Agent 1 (Web scraper): Requires API quota >100 calls, <10 min
- Agent 2 (LLM analyzer): Requires Agent 1 output, GPU preferred (fallback: CPU 3x slower)
- Agent 3 (Synthesis): Requires Agent 2 output, business hours only (human review)

Orchestrator decides:
- 9am: API quota available, GPU busy → Run Agent 1, queue Agent 2 for GPU
- 11am: GPU free → Run Agent 2
- 2pm: Business hours → Run Agent 3 with human in loop
```

### When to Use

**Optimal For**:
- Resource-constrained environments
- Mixed workload priorities (some urgent, some batch)
- Cost optimization critical
- Complex dependency graphs

**Design Principles**:
1. **Explicit Constraints**: Agents declare requirements upfront
2. **Fallback Strategies**: Define alternatives if constraints can't be met
3. **Priority Scores**: Assign urgency for scheduling conflicts
4. **Resource Monitoring**: Track availability in real-time

## Pattern 10: Ensemble Consensus

**Status**: UNDISCOVERED (related to Pixee's multi-agent consolidation but not formalized)

### Architecture
```
Input → Multiple Diverse Agents (different models, prompts, approaches)
            ↓           ↓           ↓
        Agent A     Agent B     Agent C
            ↓           ↓           ↓
         Output A   Output B   Output C
                     ↓
            Consensus Agent
         (Vote, average, or meta-decision)
                     ↓
              Final Output
```

### Key Characteristics

**Diversity for Robustness**:
- Multiple agents solve SAME task differently
- Example: 3 agents classify customer pain, final answer = majority vote
- Reduces bias from single agent/prompt/model

**Consensus Mechanisms**:
- Voting (majority wins)
- Confidence-weighted averaging
- Meta-agent (LLM decides which agent output is best)

**Example Use Case**: Critical Classification Tasks
```
Task: Classify company as ICP fit (Yes/No)

Agent A (Rules-based): Uses 10 criteria checklist → Yes (confidence: 80%)
Agent B (LLM Claude): Analyzes website semantically → No (confidence: 60%)
Agent C (LLM GPT-4): Similar to B but different prompt → Yes (confidence: 70%)

Consensus Agent:
- Majority vote: 2 Yes, 1 No → Yes
- Confidence weighting: (0.8 + 0.7) / 2 = 0.75 vs 0.6 → Yes
- Meta-agent: Reviews all 3 outputs + reasoning → Final decision: Yes (with caveats)
```

### When to Use

**Optimal For**:
- High-stakes decisions (wrong answer = expensive)
- Uncertain/ambiguous inputs (no clear ground truth)
- Redundancy desired (mission-critical systems)
- Debugging agent disagreements (why did they differ?)

**Design Principles**:
1. **Agent Diversity**: Different models, prompts, or methodologies (not 3x same agent)
2. **Consensus Mechanism**: Define how to resolve disagreements
3. **Confidence Reporting**: Agents must output confidence scores
4. **Disagreement Analysis**: Log when consensus fails (improve agents)

---

## Pattern Instantiation Priority

**Immediate Value** (formalize from existing implicit use):
1. **Fanout-Fanin** → Already using in Wave 1, formalize for reuse
2. **Iterative Refinement** → Extract from Pixee refactor agents
3. **Probabilistic Router** → Extract from messaging/pain classification

**High Value, Not Yet Used**:
4. **Ensemble Consensus** → For critical research decisions
5. **Event-Driven** → For ongoing GTM monitoring systems

**Future Exploration**:
6. **Hierarchical Decomposition** → For very complex tasks
7. **Constraint-Based** → When resource optimization becomes critical

## Next Steps

1. **Formalize Fanout-Fanin**: Document as reusable pattern in Wave 1 execution
2. **Extract Iterative Refinement**: Analyze Pixee refactor agents, abstract pattern
3. **Prototype Ensemble**: Test on critical classification task (ICP fit scoring?)
4. **Validate with Implementation**: Build one novel pattern end-to-end
