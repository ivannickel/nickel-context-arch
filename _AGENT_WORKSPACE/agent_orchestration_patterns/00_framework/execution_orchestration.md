# Execution Orchestration Plan

**How to Execute the Meta-Analysis Using Sub-Agent Orchestration**

---

## Overview

This meta-analysis uses **Pattern 4: Parallel Fanout-Fanin** (a novel pattern discovered during this analysis) to extract orchestration patterns from three case studies.

**Approach**:
- **Wave 1**: Parallel fanout (3 independent agents analyze different dimensions)
- **Wave 2**: Sequential synthesis (3 agents build on Wave 1 + each other)
- **Novel Pattern Discovery**: First-principles analysis of undiscovered patterns

---

## Wave 1: Parallel Pattern Extraction

**Pattern Applied**: Fanout-Fanin (novel pattern instantiation)

### Agent 01: Structural Taxonomy Extractor

**Objective**: Extract directory structure patterns, naming conventions, domain boundaries

**Input Corpus**:
- `gtm_engagements/02_warm_lead/recur_software_role/` (165MB, 43 markdown + Python)
- `gtm_engagements/03_active_client/pixee_ai_gtm/` (173MB, 213 markdown files)

**Analysis Tasks**:
1. Map directory hierarchies (depth, branching factor, naming patterns)
2. Identify domain boundaries (foundation, research, synthesis, execution, archive)
3. Extract file organization principles (chronological, functional, domain-based)
4. Analyze front matter schemas (YAML metadata patterns)
5. Document wikilink/reference patterns (graph topology)

**Output Contract**:
```yaml
file: 03_outputs/wave1/structural_taxonomy_report.md
sections:
  - directory_hierarchy_patterns
  - naming_convention_taxonomy

**Analysis Tasks**:
1. Classify agents by role (collector, analyzer, synthesizer, executor, maintainer)
2. Extract input/output schemas (what each agent consumes/produces)
3. Identify validation rules (quality gates, error handling)
4. Map inter-agent contracts (handoff protocols)

**Analysis Tasks**:
1. Extract attribution schemas (how sources are cited)
2. Compare evidence level taxonomies (verified vs inferred vs unknown)
3. Analyze lineage tracking (how transformations are traced)
4. Identify disposal/archive attribution (what was removed and why)
5. Document attribution anti-patterns (missing sources, vague citations)

Task: Agent 01 - Structural Taxonomy &
Task: Agent 02 - Role & Contract Extraction &
Task: Agent 03 - Attribution Comparator &

# Wait for all to complete
wait

# Total time: max(Agent 01, Agent 02, Agent 03) = ~60 minutes

**Input**:
- Wave 1 outputs (structural patterns, agent roles, attribution systems)

**Analysis Tasks**:
1. Extract complete L0-L6 layer definitions
2. Document progressive context deepening methodology
3. Map evidence escalation (how UNKNOWN → INFERRED → VERIFIED)

Task: Agent 04 - [Tool] L0-L6 Methodology
wait

# Agent 05 uses Wave 1 outputs
Task: Agent 05 - Context Graph Maintenance
wait

# Agent 06 uses ALL prior outputs
Task: Agent 06 - Meta-Synthesis
wait

# Total time: 45+45+90 = 180 minutes
```

**Dependencies**:
- Agent 04, 05 depend on Wave 1 (parallel after Wave 1 completes)
- Agent 06 depends on Wave 1 + Agent 04 + Agent 05

## Orchestration Pattern Used: Hybrid Composite

**This meta-analysis itself demonstrates a composite pattern**:

1. **Wave 1**: Fanout-Fanin (parallel extraction → synthesis)
2. **Wave 2**: Sequential Cascade (each agent builds on previous)
3. **Validation**: Iterative Refinement (improve outputs if below threshold)
4. **Novel Patterns**: First-principles analysis (not agent-driven, analytical)

**Meta-Insight**: This execution plan is itself an instance of the patterns being discovered.
