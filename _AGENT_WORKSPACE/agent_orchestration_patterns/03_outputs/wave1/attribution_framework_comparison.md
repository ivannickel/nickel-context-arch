# Attribution Framework Comparison: Evidence Systems in Context Engineering
**Agent 03: Attribution Framework Comparator - Wave 1 Meta-Analysis**

**Generated**: 2025-10-08
**Scope**: Comparative analysis of evidence attribution systems across [Tool], Recur, and Pixee case studies
**Purpose**: Build comprehensive attribution framework design guide for context engineering projects

---

## 1. Executive Summary

This analysis compares evidence attribution methodologies across three GTM case studies to extract reusable patterns for context engineering. Each system demonstrates distinct approaches to source citation, evidence verification, and content lineage tracking:

**[Tool] Attribution System** (Falsifiable Methodology)
- **Philosophy**: Every claim needs proof or explicit UNKNOWN flag
- **Schema**: Inline citations with 3-level evidence taxonomy (VERIFIED/INFERRED/UNKNOWN)
- **Rigor**: Maximum - explicit confidence levels on every assertion
- **Use Case**: High-stakes research where evidence quality matters more than speed

**Recur Attribution System** (Transparent Data Methodology)
- **Philosophy**: Document HOW data was gathered, not just WHAT was found
- **Schema**: Multi-source verification with explicit data source tiers
- **Rigor**: Standard - systematic source attribution with verification levels
- **Use Case**: Data-driven campaigns where methodology transparency enables reproducibility

**Pixee Attribution System** (Complete Lineage Traceability)
- **Philosophy**: Track content from creation → consolidation → disposal
- **Schema**: YAML front matter + wikilinks + disposal logs
- **Rigor**: Comprehensive - full transformation chain with rollback capability
- **Use Case**: Long-lived systems where content evolution and archival safety matter

### Key Insights on Evidence Rigor

**Insight 1: Attribution rigor scales with project lifespan**
- Recur (6-week campaign): Moderate citation rigor, methodology documentation
- Pixee (ongoing system): Moderate citation rigor, MAXIMUM lineage tracking

**Insight 2: Explicit evidence levels prevent drift**
- Without explicit levels, "inferred" claims inflate to "verified" over time
- Taxonomy must have clear semantic definitions, not just labels

**Insight 3: Disposal requires attribution**
- Pixee's disposal lineage prevents silent knowledge loss
- Systematic disposal documentation is rare but critical for long-lived systems

### Recommended Practices Synthesized

1. **Always use explicit evidence levels** - [Tool]'s 3-level system is minimum viable rigor
2. **Document transformation chains** - Pixee's lineage tracking prevents orphaned content
3. **Separate citation format from confidence taxonomy** - Schema (how to cite) vs semantics (what it means)
4. **Plan for disposal from day one** - Systematic archival prevents accumulation debt
5. **Use YAML front matter for metadata** - Pixee's approach enables systematic lineage tracking

## 2. Attribution Schema Comparison


**Core Pattern**: Embed evidence level and source URL directly in claims

**Citation Format Examples**:
```markdown
**Value Proposition:** "[Exact quote from website]" [SOURCE: URL, DATE: YYYY-MM-DD]

CUSTOMER: Acme Corp
INDUSTRY: B2B SaaS
SIZE: 450 employees (LinkedIn, 2025-10-07)
USE_CASE: "Used for sales team enrichment" (G2 review)
EVIDENCE_LEVEL: VERIFIED
SOURCE: https://g2.com/products/xyz/reviews - Review by VP Sales at Acme Corp

SALES_CYCLE_ESTIMATE: 3-6 months
CONFIDENCE: Medium
REASONING: Based on product complexity (HIGH from L0) + customer size (450 employees from L1)
DIRECT_EVIDENCE: "Took 4 months to evaluate" - G2 review, 2025-09-15
```

**Required Fields**:
- **SOURCE**: Exact URL or specific document reference
- **DATE**: When data was accessed/captured (enables staleness assessment)
- **EVIDENCE_LEVEL**: VERIFIED | INFERRED | UNKNOWN (explicit confidence)
- **REASONING**: Logic chain for inferred claims

**Schema Rigor**:
- **Minimal**: Value prop + source URL
- **Standard**: Value prop + source URL + date + evidence level
- **Comprehensive**: All standard fields + reasoning for inferences + cross-validation notes

**Example - Minimal (Insufficient)**:
```markdown
Value Prop: "Fast data enrichment"
Source: Website
```
*Problems*: Vague claim, no URL, no date, no evidence level

**Example - Standard (Good)**:
```markdown
Value Prop: "Enrich 1,000 contacts in minutes with waterfall logic"
Source: https://clay.com/product, accessed 2025-10-07
Evidence Level: VERIFIED
```

**Example - Comprehensive (Excellent)**:
```markdown
Value Prop: "Enrich 1,000 contacts in minutes with waterfall logic"
Source: https://clay.com/product (Product page, section 2), accessed 2025-10-07
Evidence Level: VERIFIED (exact quote from marketing page)
Cross-Validation: Claim validated by 3 customer case studies (DC Rolfe, Cavalier, Leeds Plastic) mentioning "minutes not hours" for enrichment
```

### 2.2 Recur Attribution Schema: Data Source + Verification Tiers

**Core Pattern**: Document data source provenance and verification method

**Citation Format Examples**:
```markdown
| Customer | Industry | Size | Evidence Level | Source |
|----------|----------|------|----------------|--------|
| DC Rolfe Ltd | Precision Engineering/CNC | 10+ staff | VERIFIED | https://www.statii.co.uk/case-study/dc-rolfe |
| Leeds Plastic | Plastic CNC/Fabrication | 10 staff | CLAIMED | https://www.statii.co.uk/stories |

**ICP Profile**:
- **Company Size**: 10-50 employees (verified from case studies)
- **Industries**: Metal fabrication, CNC machining, plastics
- **Business Model**: Make-to-order / job shop operations (NOT mass production)
- **Tech Maturity**: Currently on spreadsheets, basic accounting software (Sage, Xero)
- **Decision Makers**: Operations managers, owners, plant directors (engineering backgrounds)

**Data Source**: Companies House API (free, comprehensive UK company data)
**Methodology**: 6-week workflow from SIC code search → website validation → enrichment → scoring
**TAM Sizing**: 1,000-2,000 addressable companies nationally (conservative: 980, optimistic: 2,000)
```

**Required Fields**:
- **Source**: Specific data provider (Companies House, G2, website, case study)
- **Verification Method**: How claim was validated (case study quote, website statement, review analysis)
- **Evidence Level**: VERIFIED (public confirmation) | CLAIMED (company states, no confirmation) | MENTIONED (referenced but relationship unclear)
- **Methodology Documentation**: HOW data was gathered (enables reproducibility)

**Schema Rigor**:
- **Minimal**: Source name only
- **Standard**: Source + verification method + evidence level
- **Comprehensive**: All standard + complete methodology documentation + sample size limitations

**Unique Strength**: Transparent methodology enables reproducibility
- Another researcher can follow the 6-week workflow and get same results
- Data source limitations explicitly documented (no revenue data, employee counts estimated)
- Sample size constraints acknowledged ("5-customer sample size means patterns are hypotheses")

### 2.3 Pixee Attribution Schema: Front Matter Lineage + Disposal Tracking

**Core Pattern**: YAML metadata tracks content lifecycle from creation to disposal

**Front Matter Format**:
```yaml
---
name: DOCUMENT_NAME

tags: [foundation, market, competitive]
personas: [ciso, vp-engineering, head-appsec]
topics: [vulnerability-remediation, reachability-analysis]
competitors: [veracode, snyk, checkmarx]
related_docs:
  - "[[MEDDPICC_and_Personas]]"
  - "[[condensed_positioning]]"
context_lineage:
  system_attribution:
    methodology_source: "Abby Covert - How to Make Sense of Any Mess (IA principles)"
    adaptation_author: "Applied Context Engineering for Business Intelligence"
    creation_date: "2025-01-19"
  agent_dependencies:
    input_requirements:
      - "Foundation Domain: Company context preservation verification"
    output_enables:
      - "Discovery Domain: Research insights preservation verification"
    critical_path: "Week 2 execution - depends on Foundation completion"
  consolidation_scope:
    source_files: ["file1.md", "file2.md", "file3.md"]
    target_reduction: "67% file reduction"
    preservation_verification: "100% valuable content confirmed"
---
```

**Required Fields (Basic)**:
- **name**: Document identifier
- **description**: Purpose and scope
- **domain**: Organizational location
- **last_updated**: Staleness tracking

**Required Fields (Lineage)**:
- **related_docs**: Wikilink cross-references
- **context_lineage.source_files**: What was consolidated
- **context_lineage.consolidation_scope**: Transformation details

**Required Fields (Disposal)**:
- **disposal_rationale**: Why content can be safely removed
- **lineage_verification**: Where valuable insights were preserved
- **rollback_capability**: How to restore if needed

**Disposal Lineage Example**:
```yaml
disposal_documentation:
  file: "Competitor Website Action Plan - ChatGPT Deep Research.docx"
  disposal_date: "2025-01-20"
  disposal_rationale: "Complete content migration verified, Word format redundant"
  markdown_equivalent: "01_discovery/competitive_intelligence/competitor-website-action-plan---chatgpt-deep-research.md"
  lineage_verification: "ChatGPT competitive analysis preserved in Discovery domain"
  consolidated_into: "00_foundation/comprehensive_market_and_customer_intelligence_context.md"
  preservation_confirmation: "Section 3: Competitive Intelligence contains all strategic insights from source"
  rollback_procedure: "Source .docx backed up at /backups/2025-01-20/ for 1 year retention"
```

**Schema Rigor**:
- **Minimal**: Basic front matter (name, description, domain)
- **Standard**: Basic + related_docs wikilinks + last_updated
- **Comprehensive**: Standard + full context_lineage + disposal_documentation

**Unique Strength**: Complete transformation traceability
- Can trace any insight back through consolidation chain
- Disposal safety gates prevent knowledge loss
- Rollback capability if consolidation was premature

### 2.4 Rigor Comparison Matrix

| Dimension | [Tool] | Recur | Pixee |
|-----------|------|-------|-------|
| **Citation Granularity** | Inline per claim | Per data source | Per document |
| **Evidence Taxonomy** | 3-level explicit | 3-level explicit | Implicit via location |
| **Source Dating** | Required | Required | Optional (last_updated) |
| **Reasoning Documentation** | Required for inferences | Required for methodology | Not emphasized |
| **Cross-Validation** | Recommended | Encouraged | Via related_docs |
| **Lineage Tracking** | Git-based (implicit) | Git-based (implicit) | YAML front matter (explicit) |
| **Disposal Attribution** | Not documented | Not documented | Systematic disposal logs |
| **Rollback Capability** | Git history | Git history | Documented procedure |
| **Staleness Detection** | DATE field | DATE field | last_updated field |
| **Schema Complexity** | Low | Medium | High |
| **Implementation Cost** | Low (inline text) | Medium (tables + methodology) | High (YAML + disposal protocols) |

### Key Takeaway: Schema vs. Semantics Separation

**Schema** = HOW to cite (format, required fields)
**Semantics** = WHAT it means (evidence quality, confidence levels)

All three systems conflate these:
- Recur: Table-based citations (schema) + VERIFIED/CLAIMED/MENTIONED levels (semantics)
- Pixee: YAML front matter (schema) + domain location implies confidence (semantics)

**Best Practice**: Separate schema from semantics
- Schema can be lightweight (URL + date)
- Semantics must be explicit (evidence level taxonomy with clear definitions)
- Don't rely on document location to imply confidence (Pixee's implicit approach is risky)

---

## 3. Evidence Level Taxonomies


**Taxonomy Semantics**:

**VERIFIED** = Direct evidence with public confirmation
- Definition: "Claim has primary source evidence that can be independently validated"
- Examples:
  - Customer testimonial with attribution: "It was becoming exhausting to manage" - Hayden Sharpe, Operations Manager, DC Rolfe [SOURCE: https://www.statii.co.uk/case-study/dc-rolfe]
  - Exact quote from company website with URL
  - G2 review with verified purchaser badge
  - Press release from credible source
  - Job posting with specific role count and date
- Criteria: Another researcher can access same source and confirm claim
- Risk: Low - claim is fact-checkable

**INFERRED** = Logical deduction from verified evidence with explicit reasoning
- Definition: "Claim is reasonable conclusion from verified data, with inference chain documented"
- Examples:
  - "Sales cycle: 3-6 months (INFERRED from product complexity HIGH + customer size 450 employees + no direct evidence)"
  - "GTM Motion: PLG → Enterprise (INFERRED from job postings: 10 Growth Engineers + 5 Enterprise AEs)"
  - "Bottleneck: Upmarket expansion (INFERRED from 10 Enterprise AE roles posted in last 30 days + previous SMB focus from customer evidence)"
- Criteria: Reasoning must be explicit and challengeable
- Required: "REASONING: [logical chain]" field
- Risk: Medium - claim quality depends on inference logic

**UNKNOWN** = Insufficient data to make claim, gap flagged explicitly
- Definition: "Critical information gap that requires discovery or additional research"
- Examples:
  - "Customer buying committee: UNKNOWN - No testimonials mention stakeholders, no review site data on decision makers"
  - "Tech stack: UNKNOWN - No HG Insights data, no tool mentions in job postings"
  - "Revenue range: UNKNOWN - Private company, no public financial disclosure"
- Criteria: Gap must be important enough to flag (not trivial unknowns)
- Required: "Would need: [what data source]" to acknowledge path to verification
- Risk: None - honest acknowledgment prevents false confidence

**Evidence Level Inflation Anti-Pattern**:
```markdown
❌ BAD: "Customer: Enterprises" (unlabeled, sounds verified but is assumed)
✅ GOOD: "Customer: Enterprises (INFERRED from 3 case studies showing 1,000+ employee companies)"

❌ BAD: "Buying committee: C-Level" (no source, no reasoning)
✅ GOOD: "Buying committee: UNKNOWN - No public data on decision makers. Would need discovery calls to validate."

❌ BAD: "Sales cycle: Fast" (vague + unlabeled)
✅ GOOD: "Sales cycle: 3-6 months (INFERRED from product complexity MEDIUM + customer size 50-200 employees, validated against similar SaaS companies)"
```

### 3.2 Recur Data Source Tiers + Customer Verification

**Recur uses TWO dimensions of evidence quality**:

**Dimension 1: Customer Relationship Verification**
- **VERIFIED**: Customer publicly confirms relationship (case study quote, testimonial, review)
- **CLAIMED**: Company lists customer, no public confirmation found
- **MENTIONED**: Customer referenced in article/search but relationship unclear

**Dimension 2: Data Source Reliability Tiers**

**Primary Sources (High Confidence)**:
1. Company website (product pages, case studies, pricing)
2. Customer testimonials with attribution
3. G2/Capterra verified reviews
4. Press releases about customer wins
5. Government data (Companies House for UK companies)

**Secondary Sources (Medium Confidence)**:
6. LinkedIn company profiles (for team size, locations)
7. Conference presentations featuring customers
8. Third-party articles mentioning customers
9. Job postings (for GTM signals, tech stack)

**Tertiary Sources (Low Confidence - Avoid)**:
10. Unattributed customer logos
11. Marketing claims without evidence
12. Competitor websites making claims
13. Reddit/forum speculation

**Data Source Documentation Example**:
```markdown
**ICP Profile**:
- **Company Size**: 10-50 employees (VERIFIED from 5 case studies)
  - Primary Source: Company case study pages with explicit employee counts
  - Cross-Validation: LinkedIn profiles confirming size range

- **Industries**: Metal fabrication (SIC 25990), CNC machining (SIC 25620)
  - Primary Source: Companies House SIC code classification
  - Cross-Validation: Customer website descriptions match SIC codes

- **Geographic Focus**: Midlands/Yorkshire concentration
  - Primary Source: Customer addresses from case studies (5/5 in region)
  - Limitation: Sample size N=5 means pattern is hypothesis, not statistical fact
```

**Unique Strength**: Methodology transparency
- Documents HOW data was gathered, not just WHAT was found
- Sample size limitations explicitly acknowledged
- Data gaps clearly stated (no revenue data, employee counts estimated)
- Enables reproducibility - another researcher following same method gets same results

### 3.3 Pixee Lineage-Based Implicit Confidence

**Pixee's approach**: Document location implies confidence level

**Confidence Hierarchy (Implicit)**:
1. **00_foundation/** (canonical_source: true) - Highest confidence
   - Consolidated from multiple sources with explicit verification
   - Marked as authoritative reference for domain
   - Example: comprehensive_market_and_customer_intelligence_context.md

2. **01_discovery/** - Medium-high confidence
   - Research outputs with source attribution
   - Raw data from customer interviews, competitive analysis
   - Example: customer call transcripts, market research

3. **02_content/** - Medium confidence
   - Synthesis and frameworks built on foundation/discovery
   - Strategic recommendations based on validated insights
   - Example: messaging architecture, content strategy

4. **04_archive/** - Variable confidence (historical value)
   - Superseded content or source documents
   - Retained for lineage but not actively used
   - Example: old research documents, event-specific analysis

**Front Matter Confidence Indicators**:
```yaml
canonical_source: true   # Authoritative reference, highest confidence
file_type: strategic_positioning  # Type implies evidence level
domain: foundation       # Location implies validation rigor
consolidated_from: ["source1.md", "source2.md"]  # Lineage shows synthesis
```

**Weakness**: Implicit confidence is risky
- No explicit VERIFIED/INFERRED labels
- Confidence must be inferred from document location
- Risk of misinterpreting archive content as validated

**Strength**: Complete lineage traceability
- Can trace any claim back through consolidation chain
- Disposal documentation prevents silent knowledge loss
- Related_docs wikilinks show provenance

### 3.4 Conflict Resolution Approaches

**When sources disagree, how do systems handle conflicts?**

**[Tool] Approach: Flag Contradiction, Document Both**
```markdown
SALES_CYCLE_ESTIMATE: 3-6 months (INFERRED)
CONFLICT DETECTED:
  - Source 1: "Fast implementation" (company website) suggests <3 months
  - Source 2: "Took 4 months to evaluate" (G2 review) suggests 4+ months
  - Source 3: Product complexity (HIGH from L0) suggests 6+ months
RESOLUTION: Range estimate (3-6 months) captures uncertainty
CONFIDENCE: Low due to conflicting signals
VALIDATION NEEDED: Discovery calls to confirm actual cycle length
```

**Recur Approach: Weight by Source Quality + Sample Size**
```markdown
CUSTOMER_ICP - Company Size: 10-30 employees
EVIDENCE:
  - 5 verified customers: All 10-30 employee range (100% pattern)
  - Website marketing: "Small to medium manufacturers" (vague, lower weight)
  - Job postings: "Enterprise AE" roles (suggests upmarket, conflict)
RESOLUTION: Prioritize verified customer evidence (Primary Source) over marketing claims
LIMITATION: N=5 sample size - pattern is hypothesis requiring testing
CONFLICT: Enterprise AE hiring suggests potential upmarket pivot - flag for validation
```

**Pixee Approach: Consolidation + Conflict Documentation**
```yaml
consolidation_conflicts:
  - conflict_type: "Persona prioritization disagreement"
    source_1: "persona_map_extracted.md prioritizes CISO as primary persona"
    source_2: "pixee----pqs-segments.md prioritizes Head of AppSec as primary persona"
    resolution: "Unified framework positions Head of AppSec as Champion (technical buyer), CISO as Economic Buyer per MEDDIC methodology"
    rationale: "Customer interview data shows AppSec champions deals, CISO approves budget"
    preserved_in: "00_foundation/MEDDPICC_and_Personas.md Section 2.1"
```

**Best Practice Synthesis**:
1. **Never hide conflicts** - Contradictory evidence reveals important nuance
2. **Weight by source quality** - Primary sources override secondary
3. **Document resolution logic** - Explain WHY you chose one interpretation
4. **Flag for validation** - Conflicts indicate need for discovery/testing
5. **Use ranges when uncertain** - "3-6 months" is more honest than "4 months"

## 4. Lineage Tracking Patterns

### 4.1 Pattern 1: Git-Based Version Lineage (All Systems)

**Universal Pattern**: All three systems rely on git for version control

**What Git Tracks**:
- File creation, modification, deletion timestamps
- Author attribution for every change
- Complete file history with diff capability
- Branch-based isolation for experimental changes

**Example Git Lineage**:
```bash
# See full file history
git log --follow meta_analysis/attribution_framework_comparison.md

# See who changed what when
git blame meta_analysis/attribution_framework_comparison.md

# See content at specific point in time
git show HEAD~5:meta_analysis/attribution_framework_comparison.md

# Restore deleted file
git checkout HEAD~10 -- deleted_file.md
```

**Strengths**:
- Automatic - no manual documentation required
- Complete - every change is tracked
- Rollback-capable - can restore any prior version
- Industry standard - developers understand git

**Weaknesses**:
- **Implicit** - lineage exists but requires git command knowledge
- **Not semantic** - git tracks changes, not transformation rationale
- **No disposal documentation** - deleted files disappear from active view
- **Requires git literacy** - non-technical users can't trace lineage

**[Tool]/Recur Reliance on Git**:
- Both systems use git for version history
- No explicit lineage documentation in markdown files
- Disposal = file deletion (visible in git log but not actively documented)
- Transformation chains not documented (research → spec → code drift possible)

### 4.2 Pattern 2: Front Matter Lineage (Pixee)

**Explicit Lineage Tracking via YAML**:

**Basic Lineage** (Document relationships):
```yaml
related_docs:
  - "[[MEDDPICC_and_Personas]]"
  - "[[condensed_positioning]]"
  - "[[comprehensive_market_and_customer_intelligence_context]]"
```
*Enables*: Navigation, cross-referencing, dependency understanding

**Consolidation Lineage** (Transformation documentation):
```yaml
context_lineage:
  consolidation_scope:
    source_files:
      - "persona_map_extracted.md"
      - "pixee----pqs-segments.md"
      - "pixee---permissionless-value-props.md"
    target_reduction: "67% file reduction (3 files → 1 unified framework)"
    preservation_verification: "100% valuable insights consolidated into MEDDPICC_and_Personas.md"
    transformation_rationale: "Eliminated 85% persona overlap while preserving psychological insights"
```
*Enables*: Understanding what was consolidated, why, and where insights went

**Dependency Lineage** (Agent orchestration):
```yaml
context_lineage:
  agent_dependencies:
    input_requirements:
      - "Foundation Domain: Company context preservation verification"
      - "Discovery Domain: Research insights preservation verification"
    output_enables:
      - "Synthesis Domain: Strategic frameworks preservation verification"
    critical_path: "Week 3 execution - depends on Foundation + Discovery completion"
```
*Enables*: Execution sequencing, dependency validation, parallelization opportunities

**Strengths**:
- **Explicit** - lineage visible in file without git knowledge
- **Semantic** - documents WHY transformations happened
- **Navigable** - wikilinks enable easy traversal
- **Queryable** - YAML enables programmatic lineage queries

**Weaknesses**:
- **Manual** - requires discipline to maintain
- **Verbose** - YAML adds significant file overhead
- **Inconsistency risk** - Front matter can drift from actual content

**Best Practice**:
```yaml
# Minimal front matter (lightweight, maintainable)
---
name: DOCUMENT_NAME
description: Purpose in one sentence
related_docs: ["[[key_dependency_1]]", "[[key_dependency_2]]"]
last_updated: 2025-10-08
---

# Standard front matter (recommended balance)
---
name: DOCUMENT_NAME
description: Purpose and scope
domain: foundation|discovery|synthesis
file_type: research|framework|campaign
related_docs: ["[[dependency_1]]", "[[dependency_2]]"]
consolidated_from: ["source1.md", "source2.md"]  # If consolidation occurred
last_updated: 2025-10-08
---

# Comprehensive front matter (high-maintenance, use for critical docs only)
---
name: DOCUMENT_NAME
description: Detailed purpose
domain: foundation
file_type: strategic_framework
canonical_source: true
last_updated: 2025-10-08
tags: [tag1, tag2]
personas: [ciso, vp-engineering]
topics: [topic1, topic2]
related_docs: ["[[dep1]]", "[[dep2]]"]
context_lineage:
  consolidation_scope: [...]
  agent_dependencies: [...]
  preservation_verification: "..."
---
```

### 4.3 Pattern 3: Disposal Lineage Logs (Pixee)

**Novel Pattern**: Systematic disposal documentation

**Disposal Verification Checklist**:
```yaml
disposal_documentation:
  file: "Competitor Website Action Plan - ChatGPT Deep Research.docx"
  disposal_date: "2025-01-20"

  # Safety Gate 1: Content preservation verified
  markdown_equivalent: "01_discovery/competitive_intelligence/competitor-website-action-plan---chatgpt-deep-research.md"
  lineage_verification: "ChatGPT competitive analysis preserved in Discovery domain"

  # Safety Gate 2: Strategic insights consolidated
  consolidated_into: "00_foundation/comprehensive_market_and_customer_intelligence_context.md"
  preservation_confirmation: "Section 3: Competitive Intelligence contains all strategic insights from source"

  # Safety Gate 3: Rollback capability
  rollback_procedure: "Source .docx backed up at /backups/2025-01-20/ for 1 year retention"
  disposal_rationale: "Complete content migration verified, Word format redundant"

  # Safety Gate 4: Compliance check
  privacy_compliance: "No PII or sensitive contact data in file - safe to dispose"
```

**Disposal Categories (from Pixee archive agent)**:

**Category 1: Source Document Redundancy**
- Pattern: .docx → .md migration complete
- Safety: Content verified in markdown equivalent
- Rationale: File format redundancy, no unique value
- Example: "Appsec and DevSecOps - Market Voices Reports.docx" → "appsec-and-devsecops---market-voices-reports.md"

**Category 2: Tactical Analysis Completion**
- Pattern: Event-specific analysis served tactical purpose
- Safety: Strategic methodology lessons captured in retained analysis
- Rationale: Tactical detail has limited ongoing value
- Example: "dallas_dinner_line_by_line.md" (tactical) → insights preserved in "dallas_dinner_analysis.md" (strategic)

**Category 3: Superseded Strategic Analysis**
- Pattern: AI outputs or historical planning superseded by current frameworks
- Safety: Strategic methodology and insights integrated into active domain
- Rationale: Content replaced by better/current version
- Example: "pixee-next.md" (historical strategy) → insights in current strategic frameworks

**Category 4: Archive Optimization (NOT disposal)**
- Pattern: Strategic value retained but access frequency low
- Safety: Systematic access protocols documented
- Rationale: Historical value justifies retention
- Example: Founder podcast transcript, event analysis methodology

**Disposal Safety Protocol (4 Gates)**:

**Gate 1: Pre-Disposal Verification**
- [ ] Content preservation confirmed in active domains
- [ ] Line-by-line comparison completed for critical content
- [ ] Strategic insights verified in consolidated documents

**Gate 2: Lineage Documentation**
- [ ] Source → markdown → consolidation chain mapped
- [ ] Transformation rationale documented
- [ ] Consolidated destination identified

**Gate 3: Rollback Capability**
- [ ] Complete backup created before disposal
- [ ] Restoration procedure documented
- [ ] Retention period defined (1 year standard)

**Gate 4: Compliance Verification**
- [ ] PII/sensitive data identified
- [ ] Privacy regulations checked (GDPR, etc.)
- [ ] Legal/regulatory retention requirements validated

**Strengths**:
- **Prevents silent knowledge loss** - Can't delete without documentation
- **Systematic archival** - Clear criteria for disposal decisions
- **Audit trail** - Complete record of what was removed when/why
- **Rollback safety** - Can restore if disposal was premature

**Weaknesses**:
- **High overhead** - Significant documentation burden
- **Manual process** - Requires discipline and checklist adherence
- **Overkill for simple projects** - Not worth cost for short-lived work

**When to Use Systematic Disposal**:
- ✅ Long-lived systems (multi-year projects like Pixee)
- ✅ High-stakes content (regulatory/compliance documentation)
- ✅ Multi-agent systems (where transformation chains are complex)
- ❌ Short campaigns (like Recur 6-week project)

### 4.4 Pattern 4: Transformation Chain Attribution (Recur)

**Research → Code Transformation Example**:

**Step 1: Research (Agent 01 - Foundation)**
```markdown
# Statii Foundation Research Report

**ICP Profile**:
- Company Size: 10-50 employees (verified from case studies)
- Industries: Metal fabrication, CNC machining, plastics
- Business Model: Make-to-order / job shop operations
- Pain Points: Manual data entry, spreadsheet chaos, lack of real-time visibility

SOURCE: https://www.statii.co.uk/case-study/dc-rolfe
DATE: 2025-09-29
EVIDENCE: VERIFIED (case study with attribution)
```

**Step 2: Segmentation Logic (Agent 03 - Market Boundaries)**
```markdown
# Statii Market Boundary Definition

**Segment A: Metal Fabrication** (SIC 25990, 25730)
- Priority: 1
- Evidence: 3 verified customers in this segment (DC Rolfe, Cavalier, S&D)
- Source: Agent 01 customer intelligence + Companies House SIC codes

**Scoring Criteria**:
- SIC code match (Metal Fab): 30 points
- Company size 10-30 employees: 20 points
- Geographic: Midlands/Yorkshire: 15 points

SOURCE: Derived from Agent 01 foundation report
TRANSFORMATION: Customer patterns → Scoring model
```

**Step 3: Data Model (Agent 05 - Data Fusion)**
```markdown
# [Tool] Enrichment Workflow

**Step 11: SIC Code Scoring**
```
IF SIC in [25990, 25730]: +30 points  # Metal Fab segment
IF SIC in [25620]: +25 points         # CNC segment
IF SIC in [22290]: +20 points         # Plastics segment
```

**Attribution**:
- Logic source: Agent 03 market boundary segmentation
- Evidence source: Agent 01 verified customer SIC patterns
- Sample size: 5 verified customers (limitation acknowledged)
```

**Step 4: Code Implementation**
```python
# scoring_model.py

def calculate_sic_score(sic_code):
    """
    Score company based on SIC code match to verified customer patterns.

**Transformation Chain Attribution Best Practices**:

1. **Document source of logic** - Link code back to research spec
2. **Preserve reasoning** - Why these weights? (Customer evidence)
3. **Flag limitations** - Sample size constraints in comments
4. **Enable traceability** - File path references to source research
5. **Version control together** - Research and code in same repo

**Anti-Pattern: Spec-Code Drift**
```python
# BAD: Code drifted from research spec, no attribution

# Why 30 points? Why these SIC codes? What's the evidence?

### 4.5 Rollback Capabilities Comparison

**Git-Based Rollback ([Tool]/Recur/Pixee all use)**:

**Capabilities**:
- Restore entire file to prior version: `git checkout HEAD~5 -- file.md`
- Restore deleted file: `git checkout <commit> -- deleted_file.md`
- Recover content before accidental overwrite
- Time-travel to any point in project history

**Limitations**:
- Requires git command knowledge
- Difficult to selectively restore (file-level only, not section-level)
- No semantic understanding (can restore content but not know if it's still valid)
- Doesn't document WHY content was removed

**Pixee's Enhanced Rollback (Systematic Disposal)**:

**Capabilities** (beyond git):
- **Documented rollback procedures** in disposal logs
- **Backup location specified** for retained source files
- **Restoration criteria** (when to rollback)
- **Content validity assessment** (is restored content still accurate?)

**Example Rollback Decision Matrix**:
```yaml
disposal_assessment:
  file: "competitor-analysis-2024.md"
  disposal_date: "2025-01-15"
  backup_location: "/backups/2025-01/competitor-analysis-2024.md"
  retention_period: "1 year (expires 2026-01-15)"

  rollback_scenarios:
    scenario_1: "New competitor emerges with similar strategy → restore for comparison"
    scenario_2: "Customer asks about historical competitive landscape → restore for context"
    scenario_3: "Strategic pivot revives old approach → restore for methodology review"

  rollback_criteria:
    - Strategic value resurfaces
    - Historical context needed for decision
    - Content still factually accurate (not stale)

  anti_rollback_criteria:
    - Content superseded by better analysis
    - Facts outdated and would mislead
    - Insights already preserved in active documents
```

**Best Practice**: Document rollback triggers, not just procedures
- Git enables rollback CAPABILITY
- Disposal docs enable rollback DECISION-MAKING
- Combination = systematic content lifecycle management

## 5. Disposal Attribution Methodology

### 5.1 Disposal Criteria (When to Archive vs Delete vs Consolidate)

**Pixee's Systematic Disposal Framework**:

**Decision 1: Archive (Retain but move to low-frequency access)**

**Criteria**:
- Strategic value: Historical significance or methodology worth preserving
- Access frequency: Rarely needed but valuable when needed
- Staleness: Content may be outdated but has archival value
- Examples:
  - Founder podcast transcript (historical competitive positioning)
  - Event analysis methodology (reusable for future events)
  - Market research from previous year (trend comparison)

**Action**: Move to `04_archive/` with retention metadata
```yaml
archive_metadata:
  retention_justification: "Event analysis methodology valuable for future strategic events"
  access_protocol: "Consult when planning similar high-touch networking events"
  staleness_check: "Methodology timeless, specific details (contacts/venues) outdated"
  review_schedule: "Annual assessment for continued relevance"
```

**Decision 2: Delete (Safe disposal with lineage documentation)**

**Criteria**:
- Content fully migrated to new format (e.g., .docx → .md)
- Strategic insights extracted and consolidated into active documents
- No unique value remaining in original
- Examples:
  - Source .docx files after markdown conversion
  - Tactical analysis superseded by strategic synthesis
  - Duplicate content from multiple AI analysis runs

**Action**: Delete with comprehensive disposal log
```yaml
disposal_log:
  file: "tactical_event_analysis_detailed.md"
  disposal_reason: "Tactical details served immediate purpose, strategic lessons preserved"
  valuable_content_preserved_in: "event_methodology_framework.md (Section 3: Execution Playbook)"
  backup_location: "/backups/2025-01/tactical_event_analysis_detailed.md"
  backup_expiration: "2026-01-15 (1 year retention)"
```

**Decision 3: Consolidate (Merge multiple sources into unified document)**

**Criteria**:
- Significant overlap (>60%) across multiple documents
- Contradictory guidance causing confusion
- Same topic fragmented across files
- Examples:
  - 3 persona documents with 85% overlap → 1 unified persona framework
  - Multiple competitive analyses → single competitive intelligence doc
  - Scattered messaging guidance → centralized messaging architecture

**Action**: Consolidate with lineage documentation
```yaml
consolidation_log:
  target_file: "00_foundation/MEDDPICC_and_Personas.md"
  source_files:
    - "persona_map_extracted.md"
    - "pixee----pqs-segments.md"
    - "pixee---permissionless-value-props.md"
  consolidation_rationale: "85% persona overlap causing inconsistency risk"
  unique_content_preserved: "Psychological buyer profiles, PQS framework, value prop templates"
  conflicts_resolved: "Champion persona (AppSec vs CISO) resolved via MEDDIC buyer committee methodology"
  file_reduction: "67% (3 files → 1 unified framework)"
```

**Decision Matrix**:

| Criteria | Archive | Delete | Consolidate |
|----------|---------|--------|-------------|
| **Strategic Value** | Medium-High | Low-None | High (scattered) |
| **Access Frequency** | Low | Zero | Medium-High |
| **Staleness** | Outdated but useful | Superseded | Current but fragmented |
| **Overlap** | Unique content | Duplicate | 60%+ overlap |
| **Action** | Move to archive/ | Remove with log | Merge with lineage |

### 5.2 Safety Protocols (Ensure No Insight Loss)

**Pixee's 4-Gate Safety Protocol**:

**Gate 1: Content Preservation Verification**

**Process**:
1. Line-by-line comparison of source vs. destination
2. Unique insights identification
3. Strategic value assessment
4. Preservation confirmation checklist

**Example Checklist**:
```yaml
preservation_verification:
  source_file: "competitor-deep-dive-chatgpt.md"
  destination_file: "00_foundation/comprehensive_market_and_customer_intelligence_context.md"

  verification_steps:
    step_1_line_by_line_review: "COMPLETE - 487 lines reviewed"
    step_2_unique_insights_extraction: "COMPLETE - 12 unique competitive insights identified"
    step_3_destination_confirmation: "COMPLETE - All 12 insights in Section 3: Competitive Intelligence"
    step_4_quality_check: "COMPLETE - No degradation in insight quality during consolidation"

  verification_result: "SAFE TO DISPOSE - 100% strategic value preserved"
  verifier: "Foundation Consolidation Agent"
  verification_date: "2025-01-19"
```

**Gate 2: Lineage Mapping**

**Process**:
1. Document transformation chain (source → intermediate → final)
2. Identify all files that depend on this content
3. Update cross-references and wikilinks
4. Validate dependency integrity

**Example Lineage Map**:
```yaml
lineage_mapping:
  source: "persona_map_extracted.md"
  transformation_chain:
    - "persona_map_extracted.md (original research)"
    - "→ consolidated into MEDDPICC_and_Personas.md (synthesis)"
    - "→ referenced by Campaign_Messaging_and_Value_Propositions.md (application)"

  dependent_files:
    - "02_content/Campaign_Messaging_and_Value_Propositions.md"
    - "02_content/content_strategy/content_strategy_master.md"
    - "04_implementation/sales_enablement/objection_handling.md"

  cross_reference_updates:
    - "Updated [[persona_map]] → [[MEDDPICC_and_Personas]] in 3 files"
    - "Verified wikilink integrity across all dependent docs"

  lineage_validation: "COMPLETE - All dependencies mapped and updated"
```

**Gate 3: Rollback Procedure Documentation**

**Process**:
1. Create backup before disposal
2. Document backup location and retention period
3. Define rollback scenarios and triggers
4. Specify restoration procedure

**Example Rollback Doc**:
```yaml
rollback_documentation:
  backup_location: "/backups/2025-01-20/competitor-deep-dive-chatgpt.md"
  backup_timestamp: "2025-01-20T14:32:00Z"
  retention_period: "1 year (expires 2026-01-20)"

  rollback_scenarios:
    - "Consolidation quality concern raised by stakeholder"
    - "New competitive intelligence requiring original detail level"
    - "Dependency discovered that wasn't documented in lineage map"

  rollback_procedure:
    step_1: "Restore from backup: cp /backups/2025-01-20/competitor-deep-dive-chatgpt.md 01_discovery/competitive_intelligence/"
    step_2: "Verify file integrity: diff backup and restored file"
    step_3: "Update wikilinks: grep -r '[[comprehensive_market_and_customer_intelligence_context#competitive]]' and add [[competitor-deep-dive-chatgpt]] references"
    step_4: "Document rollback reason in disposal log for future reference"

  rollback_authority: "Foundation consolidation agent or human maintainer"
```

**Gate 4: Compliance & Privacy Check**

**Process**:
1. Identify PII, sensitive contact data, confidential information
2. Check privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
3. Validate legal/regulatory retention requirements
4. Document compliance clearance

**Example Compliance Check**:
```yaml
compliance_verification:
  file: "dallas_dinner_personal_connections.csv"

  pii_assessment:
    contains_pii: true
    pii_types: ["email addresses", "phone numbers", "company affiliations"]
    sensitivity_level: "Medium - professional contact info, not financial/health data"

  privacy_regulations:
    gdpr_applicable: false  # No EU residents in contact list
    ccpa_applicable: true   # California-based event
    ccpa_compliance: "Right to deletion honored - contacts informed of data removal"

  retention_requirements:
    legal_hold: false
    regulatory_retention: "None - professional networking data"
    business_justification: "Tactical event data, strategic insights preserved elsewhere"

  disposal_clearance:
    privacy_officer_approval: "Not required for non-sensitive professional contact data"
    compliance_status: "CLEARED FOR DISPOSAL"
    privacy_protocol: "Secure deletion (not just file removal)"

  disposal_method: "Secure overwrite with 3-pass DoD 5220.22-M standard"
```

### 5.3 Disposal Best Practices Synthesized

**Practice 1: Never dispose without documentation**
- Minimum: Disposal log with rationale + preservation confirmation
- Standard: 4-gate safety protocol checklist
- Comprehensive: Full lineage mapping + rollback documentation

**Practice 2: Default to archive, not delete**
- Unless content is truly redundant (format migration), archive first
- 1-year archive review cycle to reassess disposal
- Archive is safer than delete for edge cases

**Practice 3: Consolidation > Deletion**
- If content has any strategic value, consolidate instead of delete
- Consolidation preserves insights while reducing file count
- Lineage tracking is easier with consolidation than disposal

**Practice 4: Backup before every disposal**
- Automated backup script before any file deletion
- 1-year retention minimum (adjust for regulatory requirements)
- Document backup location in disposal log

**Practice 5: Test rollback procedures**
- Quarterly rollback drill to validate backup integrity
- Document any failures and update procedures
- Ensure restoration can be done by any team member, not just original author

**Anti-Pattern Examples**:

**Anti-Pattern 1: Silent Disposal**
```bash
# BAD: Delete file with no documentation
rm old_competitive_analysis.md
git commit -m "cleanup"

# What was in that file?
# Was anything valuable?
# How do we restore if needed?
# No idea - knowledge lost forever
```

**Anti-Pattern 2: "Archive Everything" Hoarding**
```
# BAD: Never dispose of anything, archive bloats
04_archive/
  ├── old_stuff_2020/
  ├── old_stuff_2021/
  ├── old_stuff_2022/
  ├── maybe_useful/
  ├── probably_not_useful/
  └── definitely_not_useful/

# 500+ files in archive, impossible to navigate
# No disposal criteria, just accumulation
# Storage cost increasing, maintenance impossible
```

**Anti-Pattern 3: Premature Deletion**
```yaml
# BAD: Delete after incomplete consolidation
disposal_log:
  file: "strategic_framework_v1.md"
  disposal_reason: "Superseded by v2"
  preservation_verification: "Skipped - assumed v2 has everything"

# 6 months later: "Where's that insight about buyer psychology from v1?"
# Can't find it in v2, can't restore v1 (no backup)
# Knowledge lost due to premature disposal
```

**Good Pattern: Systematic Disposal Workflow**
```yaml
# GOOD: Complete safety protocol
disposal_workflow:
  step_1_assessment:
    file: "competitor_analysis_2024_q1.md"
    disposal_trigger: "Q4 ended, new analysis complete"
    decision: "Archive for 1 year, then dispose if not accessed"

  step_2_preservation_check:
    unique_insights: "3 competitive insights identified"
    consolidated_into: "00_foundation/comprehensive_market_and_customer_intelligence_context.md Section 3.4"
    verification: "Line-by-line review completed, 100% coverage confirmed"

  step_3_lineage_documentation:
    source_chain: "Q1 research → Q4 synthesis → 2025 competitive strategy"
    dependent_files: ["campaign_messaging.md", "sales_battlecards.md"]
    cross_references_updated: true

  step_4_backup:
    location: "/backups/2025-01/competitor_analysis_2024_q1.md"
    retention: "1 year"
    verification: "Backup integrity verified via checksum"

  step_5_disposal:
    method: "Move to archive/ with metadata, delete after 1 year if unaccessed"
    compliance: "No PII, no retention requirements"
    rollback_documented: true

  step_6_monitoring:
    access_tracking: "Log accesses for 1 year review decision"
    review_date: "2026-01-15"
    review_criteria: "If accessed >3 times, extend retention; if 0 accesses, safe to delete"
```

### 5.4 Safety Gates to Prevent Insight Loss

**Gate Design Principles**:

**Principle 1: Multiple verification steps**
- Single-point failure is unacceptable for knowledge management
- Each gate addresses different failure mode
- Gates must be independent (can't skip gate 2 even if gate 1 passes)

**Principle 2: Explicit confirmation required**
- No "assume it's fine" - must check and confirm
- Checkboxes or YAML confirmation fields
- Automated verification where possible (diff tools, checksums)

**Principle 3: Human judgment for strategic value**
- Automation can verify format migration (file exists)
- Only humans can assess strategic insight preservation
- Critical decisions require explicit reviewer attribution

**Principle 4: Progressive safety (can always increase rigor)**
```
Minimal Safety (Tactical projects):
  - Gate 1: Content preservation check (manual review)
  - Gate 3: Backup creation

Standard Safety (Most projects):
  - Gate 1: Content preservation verification (checklist)
  - Gate 2: Lineage mapping
  - Gate 3: Rollback documentation

Comprehensive Safety (High-stakes systems):
  - All 4 gates with explicit verification
  - Automated integrity checks
  - Quarterly rollback drills
  - Compliance officer sign-off
```

**Gate Failure Recovery**:
```yaml
gate_failure_protocol:
  scenario: "Gate 1 fails - unique insights found that aren't in consolidated doc"

  immediate_action:
    - "HALT disposal process"
    - "Document discovered insights"
    - "Update consolidation target with missing content"

  remediation:
    - "Re-run Gate 1 verification after update"
    - "Document failure in disposal log (learning opportunity)"
    - "Update gate checklist to prevent recurrence"

  learning_capture:
    - "What insights were missed? (content gap)"
    - "Why were they missed? (process gap)"
    - "How to prevent? (checklist improvement)"
```

## 6. Anti-Patterns & Pitfalls

### 6.1 Anti-Pattern 1: Vague Source Attribution

**Problem**: Sources cited without specificity, making validation impossible

**Examples**:
```markdown
❌ BAD: "Industry reports suggest..."
  - Which report? Which industry? When?
  - Can't verify claim or assess staleness

❌ BAD: "Customer: Enterprise companies"
  - Which customers? How verified?
  - "Enterprise" is vague (100 or 10,000 employees?)

❌ BAD: "Source: Website"
  - Which page? What date?
  - Website changes over time, claim becomes unverifiable

❌ BAD: "Evidence Level: Verified"
  - Verified how? By whom?
  - No source URL, just label
```

**Why It Fails**:
- **Unverifiable**: Another researcher can't confirm claim
- **Unstable**: Source changes, claim becomes unfalsifiable
- **Confidence unclear**: "Verified" without source is meaningless
- **Enables drift**: Vague claims compound into false confidence

**Remediation**:

**Fix 1: Require URL + Date + Specific Location**
```markdown
✅ GOOD: "Industry reports suggest X"
  → "75% of AppSec teams struggle with alert fatigue (Gartner AppSec Survey 2024, p. 23, Figure 12)"
  → Source: https://gartner.com/appsec-survey-2024, accessed 2025-10-07

✅ GOOD: "Customer: Enterprise companies"
  → "Customer ICP: 1,000-5,000 employee companies (verified from 5 case studies: Acme Corp (2,400), BetaCo (1,200), Gamma Inc (3,800))"
  → Source: https://company.com/customers, accessed 2025-10-07

✅ GOOD: "Source: Website"
  → "Source: https://company.com/product (Product page, section 2: 'Features'), accessed 2025-10-07, exact quote: 'Enrich 1,000 contacts in minutes'"

✅ GOOD: "Evidence Level: Verified"
  → "Evidence Level: VERIFIED (direct quote from CEO blog post with attribution)"
  → Source: https://company.com/blog/ceo-vision-2025, published 2025-01-15
```

**Fix 2: Enforce Citation Template**
```markdown
# Citation template (standard rigor)
**Claim**: [What you're asserting]
**Evidence Level**: VERIFIED | INFERRED | UNKNOWN
**Source**: [Full URL]
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD (when accessed or published)
**Location**: [Section/page number if applicable]
**Reasoning**: [For INFERRED claims - why this conclusion from evidence]

# Example
**Claim**: "Sales cycle for mid-market is 3-6 months"
**Evidence Level**: INFERRED
**Source**: https://g2.com/products/acme/reviews
**Date**: 2025-10-07 (accessed)
**Location**: Review #42 by VP Sales
**Reasoning**: Review states "took 4 months to evaluate" + product complexity (HIGH) suggests 3-6 month range typical
**Cross-Validation**: No direct contradiction from other reviews (10 reviews checked)
```

### 6.2 Anti-Pattern 2: Spec-Code Drift

**Problem**: Code implementation diverges from research spec without updating attribution

**Example Failure Scenario**:

**Research Spec (Agent 03)** - `research/03_market_boundaries.md`:
```markdown
**Segment A: Metal Fabrication** (SIC 25990, 25730)
- Priority: 1
- Evidence: 3 verified customers in this segment
- Scoring: 30 points for SIC match

Last Updated: 2025-09-30
```

**Code Implementation** - `src/scoring_model.py`:
```python
def calculate_sic_score(sic_code):
    # No attribution comments
    metal_fab_sics = [25990, 25730, 12345]  # Where did 12345 come from?
    if sic_code in metal_fab_sics:
        return 35  # Why 35 instead of 30 from spec?
    return 0
```

**Drift Occurs**:
1. Developer adds SIC 12345 based on ad-hoc conversation (not in research)
2. Developer increases score to 35 for "better precision" (not in spec)
3. No comments document changes
4. Research spec says 30 points, code uses 35
5. Campaign results analyzed against wrong assumptions

**Why It Fails**:
- **Invisible drift**: No one knows code diverged from spec
- **Broken feedback loops**: Campaign results don't inform research
- **Reproducibility loss**: Can't recreate scoring logic from documentation
- **Compounding errors**: Undocumented changes accumulate

**Remediation**:

**Fix 1: Attribution Comments in Code**
```python
def calculate_sic_score(sic_code):
    """
    SIC code scoring based on verified customer analysis.

    Research Attribution:
    - Source: research/03_statii_market_boundaries.md (Agent 03)
    - Last Synced: 2025-09-30
    - Evidence: 3 verified customers in metal fabrication (SIC 25990, 25730)
    - Scoring: 30 points per research spec Section 3.2

    CHANGE LOG:
    - 2025-10-01: Added SIC 12345 based on new customer discovery (update spec)
    - 2025-10-01: Increased score to 35 for precision (DRIFT - spec still says 30)

    ACTION REQUIRED: Update research/03_market_boundaries.md to reflect code changes
    """
    metal_fab_sics = [25990, 25730, 12345]  # 12345 = Sheet metal working (new discovery)

    if sic_code in metal_fab_sics:
        return 35  # DRIFT WARNING: Spec says 30, code uses 35 - needs reconciliation
    return 0
```

**Fix 2: Automated Spec-Code Sync Checks**
```python
# test_spec_sync.py
def test_sic_scoring_matches_spec():
    """
    Validate that code implementation matches research specification.

    This test fails if spec-code drift is detected, forcing reconciliation.
    """
    # Load scoring spec from research doc
    spec = load_research_spec("research/03_market_boundaries.md")
    spec_metal_fab_score = spec["segments"]["metal_fabrication"]["score"]
    spec_metal_fab_sics = spec["segments"]["metal_fabrication"]["sic_codes"]

    # Test code matches spec
    assert calculate_sic_score(25990) == spec_metal_fab_score, \
        f"Code score {calculate_sic_score(25990)} != Spec score {spec_metal_fab_score}"

    code_sics = get_metal_fab_sics()  # Extract from code
    assert set(code_sics) == set(spec_metal_fab_sics), \
        f"Code SICs {code_sics} != Spec SICs {spec_metal_fab_sics}"
```

**Fix 3: Bidirectional Sync Process**
```markdown
# Spec-Code Sync Protocol

**Rule 1: Research changes → Update code + tests**
- Research spec is source of truth
- Code must sync within 1 sprint
- Test suite validates sync

**Rule 2: Code changes → Update research spec**
- If code must diverge (tactical necessity), document in spec
- Flag as "DRIFT" until research validates change
- Next research cycle reconciles drift

**Rule 3: Weekly drift review**
- Automated report of spec-code mismatches
- Team reviews and decides: revert code or update spec
- No drift persists >2 weeks

**Rule 4: Version tagging**
- Research spec versions tagged (v1.0, v1.1)
- Code references spec version in comments
- Breaking changes increment major version
```

### 6.3 Anti-Pattern 3: Silent Content Disposal

**Problem**: Content deleted without documentation, knowledge lost forever

**Example Failure Scenario**:

**Month 1**: Research produces `competitive_analysis_deepdive.md` with 50 unique insights

**Month 3**: New analyst creates `competitive_intelligence_2025.md`, consolidates some content

**Month 4**: Cleanup happens
```bash
git rm competitive_analysis_deepdive.md
git commit -m "cleanup old docs"
```

**Month 6**: Stakeholder asks: "What was that insight about competitor X's pricing model from Q1?"

**Problem**:
- No disposal log, no way to know what was in deleted file
- Git history has file, but no one knows to look there
- Content may have been consolidated, but which insights went where?
- 15 of 50 unique insights lost because consolidation was incomplete

**Why It Fails**:
- **Git is not disposal documentation** - Git tracks what changed, not why or where value went
- **Implicit knowledge loss** - Deleted content invisible to new team members
- **No rollback decision framework** - Should we restore? No one knows what was lost
- **Consolidation incompleteness** - Easy to miss insights during merge

**Remediation**:

**Fix 1: Disposal Log Requirement**
```yaml
# REQUIRED before any file deletion
disposal_log:
  file: "competitive_analysis_deepdive.md"
  disposal_date: "2025-04-15"
  disposal_reason: "Consolidated into competitive_intelligence_2025.md"

  content_preservation:
    total_insights: 50
    consolidated_insights: 47
    lost_insights: 3

  lost_insights_assessment:
    insight_1: "Competitor X pricing model - PRESERVED in Section 3.2 of new doc"
    insight_2: "Market positioning analysis - PRESERVED in Section 4.1"
    insight_3: "Tactical competitor response - INTENTIONALLY EXCLUDED (tactical, not strategic)"

  preservation_verification:
    method: "Line-by-line review"
    reviewer: "Agent 02"
    verification_date: "2025-04-15"

### 6.4 Anti-Pattern 4: Orphaned Content

**Problem**: Content with no lineage, can't determine source/purpose/relevance

**Example Orphaned Content**:
```markdown
# untitled_research.md

Some interesting findings about competitor X.

Their pricing is higher than expected.

Customers mentioned feature Y in reviews.

[No source, no date, no author, no purpose documented]
```

**Why This Happens**:
- Quick notes during research, never formalized
- Ad-hoc analysis without project context
- Copy-pasted from email/chat, no attribution
- Legacy content from departed team member

**Why It Fails**:
- **Can't validate**: No source = can't verify claims
- **Can't update**: No date = don't know if stale
- **Can't use**: No purpose = don't know when to apply
- **Can't dispose**: No lineage = don't know if safe to delete
- **Accumulates**: Orphaned content never gets cleaned up

**Remediation**:

**Fix 1: Mandatory Document Headers**

# Competitor X Pricing Analysis

[Content with inline source attribution...]
```

**Fix 2: Orphan Detection + Remediation**
```bash
# orphan_detector.sh
# Finds files missing critical metadata

echo "Scanning for orphaned content..."

for file in $(find . -name "*.md"); do
    # Check for required metadata
    has_author=$(grep -c "^author:" "$file")
    has_created=$(grep -c "^created:" "$file")
    has_purpose=$(grep -c "^purpose:" "$file")
    has_sources=$(grep -c "^sources:" "$file")

    if [ $has_author -eq 0 ] || [ $has_created -eq 0 ] || [ $has_purpose -eq 0 ] || [ $has_sources -eq 0 ]; then
        echo "⚠️  ORPHAN DETECTED: $file"
        echo "    Missing: author, created, purpose, or sources"
        echo "    Action: Add metadata or dispose with documentation"
        echo ""
    fi
done
```

**Fix 3: Quarterly Orphan Cleanup**
```yaml
# orphan_cleanup_protocol.yaml

quarterly_cleanup_process:
  step_1_detection:
    - "Run orphan_detector.sh to find files missing metadata"
    - "Create orphan remediation log"

  step_2_triage:
    for_each_orphan:
      - "Attempt to determine: author, date, purpose, sources"
      - "Check git history: git log --follow orphan.md"
      - "Ask team: Anyone recognize this content?"

  step_3_remediation:
    if_recoverable:
      - "Add metadata based on investigation"
      - "Link to related docs"
      - "Update status to 'remediated_orphan'"

    if_unrecoverable:
      - "Move to orphan_quarantine/ directory"
      - "Document: 'Cannot determine provenance, scheduled for disposal in 3 months if unclaimed'"
      - "Team notification: 'Orphan quarantine created, review before disposal'"

  step_4_disposal:
    after_3_months:
      - "If no one claims orphaned content, safe to dispose"
      - "Create disposal log with 'ORPHAN - unknown provenance' rationale"
      - "Backup for 1 year in case someone recognizes later"
```

### 6.5 Anti-Pattern 5: Evidence Level Inflation

**Problem**: Inferred or assumed claims drift into being treated as verified facts

**Inflation Progression**:
```markdown
# Week 1 - Honest inference
"Customer segment: SMB manufacturers (INFERRED from 3 case studies showing 10-50 employee companies)"

# Week 4 - Label dropped
"Customer segment: SMB manufacturers (from case studies)"

# Week 8 - Source dropped
"Customer segment: SMB manufacturers"

# Week 12 - Now treated as verified fact
"Target: SMB manufacturers" (used in campaign messaging as if verified)

# Week 16 - Compounds into derived claims
"Since we serve SMB manufacturers, they likely have limited IT budgets" (inference built on inference)
```

**Why It Happens**:
- **Repetition breeds confidence** - The more you see a claim, the more verified it feels
- **Convenience** - Easier to drop "INFERRED" qualifier than maintain it
- **Optimism bias** - Want claims to be true, unconsciously upgrade confidence
- **Handbook syndrome** - Internal docs sound more authoritative over time

**Why It Fails**:
- **False confidence** - Strategy built on assumed facts
- **Failed validation** - Campaign targets wrong segment because ICP was inflated
- **Compounding errors** - Inferences built on inferences create house of cards
- **Can't course-correct** - Lost track of what was verified vs assumed

**Remediation**:

**Fix 1: Evidence Level Preservation**
```markdown
# Create constant reminders that preserve evidence levels

❌ BAD: "Customer segment: SMB manufacturers"

✅ GOOD: "Customer segment: SMB manufacturers (10-50 employees)"
  - Evidence Level: INFERRED
  - Source: 3 case studies (DC Rolfe, Leeds Plastic, Cavalier)
  - Sample Size: N=3 (LIMITATION: Small sample, hypothesis requiring validation)
  - Last Validated: 2025-09-30
  - Validation Status: REQUIRES TESTING - campaign will validate hypothesis
```

**Fix 2: Confidence Decay Function**
```markdown
# Add staleness warnings that prevent old inferences from inflating

confidence_decay:
  claim: "Customer segment: SMB manufacturers (10-50 employees)"
  evidence_level: "INFERRED"
  created: "2025-09-30"
  sample_size: 3

  confidence_assessment:
    - "Age: 1 week - FRESH (confidence = baseline)"
    - "Age: 1 month - MONITOR (confidence = baseline, flag for review)"
    - "Age: 3 months - STALE (confidence = degraded, requires revalidation)"
    - "Age: 6 months - DEPRECATED (confidence = low, assume claim invalid until revalidated)"

  revalidation_triggers:
    - "Campaign results contradict hypothesis (e.g., enterprise deals closing)"
    - "New customer data available (e.g., 10 new case studies published)"
    - "Market shift detected (e.g., product positioning changes)"
```

**Fix 3: Inference Chain Tracking**
```markdown
# Document inference chains to prevent compounding

claim_lineage:
  claim_1:
    assertion: "Customer segment: SMB manufacturers (10-50 employees)"
    evidence_level: "INFERRED"
    evidence: "3 case studies showing 10-50 employee companies"
    confidence: "Medium (small sample)"

  claim_2_derived_from_claim_1:
    assertion: "SMB manufacturers have limited IT budgets"
    evidence_level: "INFERRED from INFERRED"  # ⚠️ DOUBLE INFERENCE WARNING
    evidence: "Assumes claim_1 is valid + industry research on SMB IT spending"
    confidence: "Low (inference built on small sample inference)"
    confidence_degradation: "Compounded uncertainty - requires strong validation"

  claim_3_derived_from_claim_2:
    assertion: "Price-sensitive positioning required"
    evidence_level: "INFERRED from INFERRED from INFERRED"  # ⚠️ TRIPLE INFERENCE - VERY RISKY
    evidence: "Assumes claim_2 valid (which assumes claim_1 valid)"
    confidence: "Very Low (3-level inference chain)"
    ACTION_REQUIRED: "Validate base claim_1 before using claim_3 in strategy"
```

**Fix 4: Regular Confidence Audits**
```yaml
# Quarterly evidence level audit process

confidence_audit:
  frequency: "Quarterly"
  scope: "All strategic claims in foundation documents"

  audit_steps:
    step_1_inventory:
      - "List all claims marked VERIFIED, INFERRED, UNKNOWN"
      - "Check for unlabeled claims (assume UNKNOWN until proven)"

    step_2_staleness_check:
      - "Flag claims >3 months old without revalidation"
      - "Check if sources still valid (URLs, data sources)"

    step_3_inflation_detection:
      - "Compare current docs to 3 months ago - did INFERRED become VERIFIED without new evidence?"
      - "Check for dropped evidence level labels"

    step_4_sample_size_validation:
      - "Inferences based on N<10 samples flagged for expansion"
      - "Campaign results used to validate/refute small sample inferences"

    step_5_remediation:
      - "Downgrade inflated claims to correct evidence level"
      - "Add staleness warnings to old inferences"
      - "Flag for revalidation or disposal"
```

## 7. Attribution Framework Design Guide

### 7.1 Minimal Attribution (Quick Projects, Low Rigor)

**When to Use**:
- Tactical research (1-2 week projects)
- Low-stakes decisions (exploratory research)
- Individual contributor work (no team handoff)
- Disposable deliverables (one-time analysis)

**Required Elements**:
- Source URL (for primary claims)
- Date accessed (staleness detection)
- Basic evidence labels (optional but recommended)

**Schema Template**:
```markdown
# Research Output

**Claim**: [What you found]
**Source**: [URL]
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD

Example:
**Claim**: "Competitor X offers 14-day free trial"
**Source**: https://competitorx.com/pricing
**Date**: 2025-10-07
```

**What You Get**:
- ✅ Basic verifiability (can check sources)
- ✅ Staleness detection (dates enable aging assessment)
- ✅ Minimal overhead (just URL + date)

**What You Don't Get**:
- ❌ Confidence levels (no VERIFIED/INFERRED taxonomy)
- ❌ Lineage tracking (git only)
- ❌ Disposal documentation (delete files freely)
- ❌ Transformation chains (research → code drift possible)

**Acceptable Trade-Offs**:
- Short project lifespan = low staleness risk
- Individual work = low handoff/coordination needs
- Low stakes = acceptable to have some unverified claims

**Example: [Tool] Minimal Attribution**
```markdown
# Quick Competitive Pricing Check

**Competitor A**: $99/month for 1,000 contacts
Source: https://competitora.com/pricing, 2025-10-07

**Competitor B**: $149/month for 1,000 contacts
Source: https://competitorb.com/pricing, 2025-10-07

**Takeaway**: Our $120/month positioning is mid-market
```
*Sufficient for quick comparison, not sufficient for strategic pricing decision*

### 7.2 Standard Attribution (Most Projects)

**When to Use**:
- Standard business projects (1-3 months)
- Team collaboration (handoffs required)
- Medium-stakes decisions (impacts quarterly goals)
- Reusable deliverables (used in campaigns/product)

**Required Elements**:
- Source URL + specific location (page, section)
- Date accessed + date published (if different)
- Evidence level taxonomy (VERIFIED/INFERRED/UNKNOWN)
- Reasoning for inferred claims
- Cross-references to related work

**Schema Template**:
```markdown
# Research Output with Attribution

**Claim**: [Specific assertion]
**Evidence Level**: VERIFIED | INFERRED | UNKNOWN
**Source**: [URL] ([Specific location: section, page])
**Date Accessed**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Date Published**: YYYY-MM-DD (if different)
**Reasoning**: [For INFERRED - why this conclusion from evidence]
**Cross-Validation**: [Supporting or contradicting evidence]
**Related Docs**: [[doc1]], [[doc2]]

Example:
**Claim**: "Enterprise sales cycle is 3-6 months"
**Evidence Level**: INFERRED
**Source**: https://g2.com/products/acme/reviews (Review #42 by VP Sales)
**Date Accessed**: 2025-10-07
**Date Published**: 2025-08-15
**Reasoning**: Review states "took 4 months to evaluate" + product complexity (HIGH) suggests 3-6 month range is typical for this product type
**Cross-Validation**: 3 other reviews mention "long evaluation" without specifics (consistent)
**Related Docs**: [[customer_intelligence_report]], [[sales_cycle_analysis]]
```

**What You Get**:
- ✅ Verifiable claims (with specific sources)
- ✅ Explicit confidence (VERIFIED/INFERRED/UNKNOWN)
- ✅ Reasoning transparency (inferences explained)
- ✅ Cross-reference navigation (wikilinks)
- ✅ Staleness detection (date fields)
- ✅ Team handoff capability (next person can validate)

**What You Don't Get**:
- ❌ Systematic disposal (still git-based)
- ❌ Transformation chain docs (manual tracking)
- ❌ Automated sync checking (spec-code drift possible)

**Recur Example - Standard Attribution**:
```markdown
# Statii Customer ICP Analysis

**Company Size**: 10-50 employees
**Evidence Level**: VERIFIED
**Source**: https://www.statii.co.uk/case-study/dc-rolfe (Case Study Section 1)
**Date Accessed**: 2025-09-29
**Evidence**: 5 case studies with explicit employee counts:
  - DC Rolfe: "10+ staff"
  - Leeds Plastic: "10 staff"
  - Cavalier: ~14 employees (inferred from facility size)
  - S&D Solutions: Family-run (estimated 10-20)
  - SRL Countertech: Sheffield-based (no size disclosed)
**Sample Size**: N=5 (LIMITATION: Small sample, pattern is hypothesis)
**Cross-Validation**: Website states "small to medium manufacturers" (vague but consistent)
**Related Docs**: [[market_boundary_definition]], [[scoring_model_spec]]

**Confidence**: Medium - Pattern holds for 100% of sized customers (3/5 disclosed), but sample is small
**Validation Plan**: Campaign targeting will test 10-30 vs 30-50 vs 50-100 employee segments to validate sweet spot
```

### 7.3 Comprehensive Attribution (High-Stakes, Long-Lived Systems)

**When to Use**:
- Long-lived systems (multi-year projects)
- High-stakes decisions (company strategy, major investments)
- Regulatory/compliance contexts (audit requirements)
- Complex multi-agent systems (transformation chains critical)
- Knowledge management systems (lineage preservation essential)

**Required Elements (All Standard + Additional)**:
- **Front matter metadata** (YAML with complete lineage)
- **Transformation chain documentation** (source → intermediate → final)
- **Disposal lineage** (systematic archival with safety gates)
- **Rollback procedures** (documented restoration capability)
- **Automated sync validation** (spec-code drift prevention)
- **Confidence decay tracking** (staleness assessment)
- **Conflict resolution logs** (when sources disagree)

**Schema Template**:
```yaml

## Transformation Chain Attribution

**Research → Segmentation → Scoring → Code**

1. **Research Phase** (Agent 01):
   - Input: Website analysis, case study review, G2 data
   - Output: `research/01_foundation_report.md`
   - Key Insight: 5 verified customers, all 10-50 employees

2. **Segmentation Phase** (Agent 03):
   - Input: Agent 01 customer patterns
   - Output: `research/03_market_boundaries.md`
   - Transformation: Customer patterns → ICP criteria → Scoring weights

3. **Scoring Phase** (Agent 05):
   - Input: Agent 03 segmentation logic
   - Output: `research/05_data_fusion_enrichment.md`
   - Transformation: Segmentation criteria → 100-point scoring model

4. **Code Implementation**:
   - Input: Agent 05 scoring spec
   - Output: `src/scoring_model.py`
   - Attribution: Code comments reference spec sections
   - Sync Status: Last synced 2025-10-01, no drift detected

- ✅ Rollback capability (documented procedures)
- ✅ Confidence decay tracking (prevents inflation)
- ✅ Transformation chain attribution (prevents spec-code drift)
- ✅ Conflict resolution logs (contradictory sources handled)
- ✅ Team coordination support (handoffs documented)
- ✅ Audit trail (regulatory compliance)

**What You Pay**:
- ❌ High maintenance overhead (YAML + disposal logs + sync checks)
- ❌ Requires discipline (easy to skip documentation)
- ❌ Tooling complexity (automated validation scripts)
- ❌ Learning curve (team training required)

**Pixee Example - Comprehensive Attribution**:

### 7.4 Framework Selection Decision Tree

```
START: What kind of project are you working on?

├─ Q1: How long will this project live?
│   ├─ <2 weeks → MINIMAL ATTRIBUTION (quick projects)
│   ├─ 2 weeks - 3 months → STANDARD ATTRIBUTION (most projects)
│   └─ >3 months or ongoing → Continue to Q2
│
├─ Q2: What are the stakes of decisions based on this research?
│   ├─ Low (tactical, reversible) → STANDARD ATTRIBUTION
│   ├─ Medium (quarterly impact) → STANDARD ATTRIBUTION
│   └─ High (strategic, major investment) → Continue to Q3
│
├─ Q3: How many people will use/maintain this work?
│   ├─ Just me → STANDARD ATTRIBUTION (minimal lineage okay)
│   ├─ Small team (2-5) → Continue to Q4
│   └─ Large team or cross-functional → COMPREHENSIVE ATTRIBUTION
│
├─ Q4: Are there regulatory/compliance requirements?
│   ├─ No → STANDARD ATTRIBUTION (unless complex)
│   └─ Yes (audit trails required) → COMPREHENSIVE ATTRIBUTION
│
└─ Q5: How complex is the transformation chain?
    ├─ Simple (research → output) → STANDARD ATTRIBUTION
    ├─ Moderate (research → spec → implementation) → STANDARD + transformation docs
    └─ Complex (multi-agent, many consolidations) → COMPREHENSIVE ATTRIBUTION
```

**Special Cases**:

**Case 1: Starting Minimal, Scaling Up**
- Begin with minimal attribution (speed > rigor)
- If project extends >3 months: upgrade to standard
- If becomes critical system: upgrade to comprehensive
- Each upgrade adds rigor without discarding previous work

**Case 2: Regulatory Compliance**
- Even short projects need comprehensive attribution if compliance matters
- Audit trails require disposal documentation from day 1
- Can't retrofit lineage after the fact

**Case 3: Multi-Agent Systems**
- Complex transformation chains require comprehensive from start
- Spec-code drift prevention essential
- Lineage tracking prevents orphaned content

## Sample Size Limitations

**Critical Limitation**: [Honest assessment of sample size constraints]

Example:
**Sample Size**: N=5 verified customers
**Limitation**: Pattern is hypothesis, not statistical fact
**Implication**: Segmentation criteria based on small sample should be tested via campaign execution
**Validation Plan**: Campaign will target 3 segments (10-30, 30-50, 50-100 employees) to validate sweet spot

## Conclusion: Building Your Attribution System

**Key Takeaways**:

1. **Evidence rigor scales with project lifespan** - Quick projects need minimal attribution, long-lived systems need comprehensive lineage

2. **Explicit evidence levels prevent drift** - VERIFIED/INFERRED/UNKNOWN taxonomy forces honest assessment and prevents inflation

3. **Disposal requires attribution** - Systematic disposal documentation prevents silent knowledge loss in long-lived systems

4. **Separate schema from semantics** - Citation format (how to cite) vs confidence taxonomy (what it means) are independent choices

5. **Start minimal, upgrade as needed** - Can begin with simple URL + date, add rigor when project stakes increase

**Final Recommendation**:

**For most GTM projects**: Use Recur-style standard attribution
- Balances rigor and overhead
- Methodology transparency enables reproducibility
- Evidence levels prevent false confidence
- No heavyweight YAML or disposal logs

**For long-lived context systems**: Use Pixee-style comprehensive attribution
- Front matter lineage enables navigation
- Systematic disposal prevents accumulation debt
- Transformation chains prevent spec-code drift
- Higher overhead justified by multi-year value

**For quick research**: Use [Tool]-style minimal attribution
- Inline citations with evidence levels
- Low overhead, high speed
- Sufficient for tactical decisions
- Upgrade to standard if project extends
