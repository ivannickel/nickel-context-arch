## Findings

### Duplication Pattern
All 5 files with classification had **exactly 4 identical blocks**. This suggests:
- A merge script bug that quadruples classification blocks
- Likely occurred during batch processing of files 161-165
- Cleanup successful: All reduced to single block

### Missing Classifications
Files 151-160 have no classification at all, suggesting:
- These files were never processed by classification agents
- Or classification failed silently
- Need to be queued for classification workflow

---

## Next Steps

1. **For Orchestrator:** Add files 151-160 to classification queue
2. **For Merge Script:** Fix duplication bug (4x repeat pattern)
3. **For Phase 2:** Files 161-165 are ready for dimensional extraction
4. **For Files 151-160:** Block Phase 2 until classified
