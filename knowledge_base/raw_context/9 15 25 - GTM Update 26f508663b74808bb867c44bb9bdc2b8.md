## Google Ads

- Transitioned away from broad match; now running only **phrase match types** to tighten targeting and reduce junk traffic
- Long term, we will want to transition back to a broad match system as it is ultimately lower cost and more efficient when the algorithm is working properly
- Performance is **stabilizing** after the temporary pause caused by the billing issue
- If this trend continues, we’ll have room to **scale spend meaningfully** without losing efficiency
- Performance should get smoother as we scale, but there will be more to manage
- **Modeling comps** (e.g. Bill.com and Melio) suggests we could spend $1.5–$2M and **drive $2B+ in TPV** from Google Ads alone, but this would likely be our most expensive route to 2B

## Organic Search (Google)

- Weekly clicks increased from **1.21K → 1.62K**
- Growth driven primarily by:
    - Long-tail search around **ACH transfer limits**
    - New guides on **credit card surcharge compliance**
- ACH return code pages still growing slowly but steadily — **high ceiling**, high intent

- **Industry pages** rolling out:
    - *Roofers* page is live but needs revision
    - **Goal this week:** Launch 3 verticals and finalize content + design template to enable faster rollout across industries

## Growth Engine X (Outbound)

- 3 solid leads last Friday on new copy
- Inboxes working again,  last blocker resolved
- Running light for now: single email only, short + soft touch
- Will keep current volume steady while test new copy

## G2 Reviews

- 71 total reviews (+21 since we restarted campaign)
- Still rolling in steadily
- Reclaimed “Top Performer” and “Easiest to Use” badges

## Scaling Risk: Support, Sales, and Fraud Controls

With our recent raise, growth is unlikely to be the bottleneck, the most likely constraint is our ability to scale human sales and CS touch points and screening for fraud

### Fraud Risk Automation

- Proposal project for Jacob Deidle: 

Launch a **lightweight fraud risk automation system** to proactively score new signups
- Early signals we can flag:
    - Domain age < 1 year
    - Backlinks or presence in search
    - Broken website or clearly templated landing pages
    - Generic Lorum Ipsum or AI-generated content
    - No named team members or real LinkedIn connections
    - IP anomalies, mismatched geo, or VPN detection
- **Next step:** Review known fraud cases and build a ruleset to automate risk tagging at signup
    - Potential to integrate with Clay or HubSpot scoring
