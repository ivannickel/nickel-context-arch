## Nooks Setup & Call Structure

We're overdue for a full review of our Nooks setup. Four key issues:

1. **Nooks Seat Count**
    - Decision needed: Do we need a second seat (e.g., for AE visibility, coaching, or second SDR)?
2. **Dispositions & DNC Process**
    - Current structure is breaking follow-up. Everyone is getting DNCâ€™d, including warm connects and intel-rich convos.
    - We need clearÂ **dispo categories**Â (e.g., Champion Identified, Buyer Identified, Wrong Person, Call Back Needed).
    - **Callbacks & multi-step playbooks**Â need to be tracked and routed. Letâ€™s sync with Ryan Getz at Nooks to review.
3. **Over-Aggressive DNC'ing**
    - The current blanket DNC logic was a temporary fix and is now hurting our pipeline depth.
    - Rebuild logic with clear tiers: True DNC vs Not This Person vs Future Follow-Up.
4. **Company Office vs Main Office**
    - Zak is calling both types interchangeably â€” we need to treat these differently in dialing and messaging.

### Data Quality & Sourcing

Our connect rate issues are likelyÂ **tool + process**, not just data. That said, we need to finalize sourcing.

- **ZoomInfo vs Apollo**: Letâ€™s test Apollo now and evaluate match/cell rates vs ZoomInfo before buying more seats.
- **FullEnrich**Â meeting is set â€” could help with enrichment + validation.
- **LeadMagic**Â is another option if cleanliness stays a problem.
- **Immediate action**: run current pipeline through Apollo and score quality by function/title.

### Webflow / Contact Studios Blocker

This is a critical bottleneck:

- Ray doing Webflow isnâ€™t scalable
- Me learning it right now will be slow right now and not ideal use of time
- Iâ€™ve started conversations with Webflow design partners to replace Flowout
- **Goal**: 2â€“3 programmatic silos published this month
    
    Letâ€™s prioritize getting an external Webflow partner in place this week.

### AE Round Robin + Deal Pipeline

We should review:

- **Is round robin working?**Â Are AEs getting the right leads and ownership?
- **Are follow-ups happening?**Â Are new opps being added consistently?
- **Where are deals stalling?**Â Letâ€™s break down stage movement and AE feedback.

### Key Actions This Week

- Decide on Apollo test + ZoomInfo usage
- Rebuild Nooks disposition logic with Ryan
- Fix DNC rules and callback workflow
- Resolve Webflow partner decision
- Review AE pipeline + ownership clarity
- Decide on / update future meeting cadences (pipeline review, marketing update, etc)
