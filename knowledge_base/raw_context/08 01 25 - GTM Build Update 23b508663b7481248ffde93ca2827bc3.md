- **Record-Setting Month**: We hit an all-time high of **$36M in TPV** across *all customers* — our strongest month ever *("If every month isn't our highest month, we have a problem" - Claudio)*
    - Our *core customer base* (excluding CJ Brothers) also set a record at **$25M TPV**
- **Growth Momentum**:
    - **Overall TPV accelerated**: June → July grew **24%**, outpacing the **14% growth** from May → June
    - **Note on June growth**: While overall TPV grew significantly in June, without CJ Brothers it was a lesser delta (not a concern for now but something to note)
- **Strategic Product Adoption Excellence**:
    - **AR Leadership**: Overall AR accounts for **32.85%** of TPV, but without CJ brothers, it’s actually **at 47.34%** — nearly half our TPV
    - **Credit Card Innovation**: **Credit card percentage is also now 17%** of our total TPV (without CJ Brothers)

### **🧠 Activation & Funnel Metrics (New Accounts)**

1. [**Activation Rate**](https://app.popsql.com/dashboards/1Ba5mGBw)
- **What’s Good**
    - Activation is solid: In July, the # **of new accounts making at least 1 transaction** was right around expectations — even a bit higher.
    - This means we’re doing well getting new customers to start using the platform.
- **What Needs Work**
    - **Fewer new accounts are hitting this transaction** compared to previous months.
    - We’re getting them to start, but **not all the way through** — we need to help push them over the finish line.
1. [**Activation Velocity](https://app.popsql.com/queries/-OWagX8O-zTGnZ5MO2pY) - WIP**
- Product Growth
- **August Goal**
    - Better tracking certain metrics like time to first successful transaction
        - **Activation Rate**
            - 1 Transaction Larger than Certain Thresshold OR
            - 3 Transactions
        - **Activation Velocity**
            - AEs - How to call faster?
        - **TPV**

**Conversion Rates**

### 2. 🎥 Marketing/Growth Metrics (Ivan)

- Last week was our **highest week ever** for organic traffic with **819 clicks**.
- Two recent signups this week were directly attributed directly to **Contact Studios blog posts**. Expect more as content matures and rankings stabilize.

- Highest month ever for overall traffic, 19K
- Direct traffic makes up 59% of traffic and is rising
- Main driver was **credit card surcharging posts**, which are starting to rank and capture bottom-of-funnel traffic.
- **ACH return code posts** under review — planned tweaks to improve rankings.
- Next content focus: **Bank transfer limits**, aimed at capturing high-intent users who are:
    - Hitting bank or platform transfer limits
    - Experiencing delays or holds on large transactions
- Goal is to **index strongly in LLM responses** for high-value queries over time
    - Become the **recommended provider** whenever:
        - Anyone is trying to receive or make a large payment
        - Experiencing bank holds due to payment size
        - In our ICP, researching payment platforms
