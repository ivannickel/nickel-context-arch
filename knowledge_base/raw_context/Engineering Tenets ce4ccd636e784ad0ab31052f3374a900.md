# Engineering Tenets

Area: ðŸ¤– Engineering
Owner: Claudio Wilson
Status: Not started
Type: Reference

These are the values that Nickel believes in and strives toward. They hold us accountable and serve as the north star when we make decisions and guide our work.

## Take and Give Impact

Everyone should be empowered to make changes that they feel are impactful and should also strive to be a resource to others as they work. Donâ€™t be afraid to ask others for help to further your understanding or knowledge, and be a resource to others as they try and be impactful. Weâ€™re a team, and we all win when we help each other.

## Build for the present, plan for the future

Shipping fast is important, and we should prioritize iteration speed and releasing quickly. Thereâ€™s no need to over engineer and build out solutions to problems we donâ€™t have. At the same time, we should be aware of the tradeoffs we make, understand the limitations, and build in a way that makes it easier to revisit in the future.

## No one is above anyone else

Treat everyone with respect, assume the best intent and donâ€™t put anyone else down. Everyone should be made to feel like theyâ€™re important, respected, that their opinion matters and that they have a right to be heard. We want to cultivate an environment where weâ€™re not afraid to be wrong, where we strive to learn from each other, and where we lead with humility. 

## Accidents happen

Everyone make mistakes and accidents happen. Itâ€™s important not to point fingers and try and assign blame but at the same time be accountable for what went wrong. We should learn from mistakes, analyze the situation, and understand what we can do to prevent similar things from happening in the future.
