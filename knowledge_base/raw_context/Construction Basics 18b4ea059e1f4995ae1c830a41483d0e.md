## Key players in construction

---

### **Owner**

Entity who “owns” or is paying for the project. An owner can be an individual or a company. Common examples include: 

- A real estate development firm like Related or Tishman Speyer
- A company like Apple looking to build a new HQ
- A government agency looking to build a new road
- A General Contractor building a house to speculate on the market
- A homeowner trying to make small improvements

### **Architect (”Designer”)**

Entity responsible for designing the project. An architect can also be an individual or company. Common examples include:

- An architectural firm like SOM or Bjark Ingels
- An interior designer
- A general contractor (common for small residential projects)

### Engineers

Entity responsible for providing engineering services and specifications. An architect can also be an individual or company. There are specialized engineering firms but sometimes architect firms will also have engineering in-house to provide “end to end” services. Engineers are responsible for developing the specification portion of Construction Documents. These include specifications for type of concrete, width of rebars, type of studs used in framing, etc. 

### General Contractor (”GC”)

Entity responsible for managing the construction project. A GC can also be an individual or a company. There are two types of general contractors:

- **Regular general contractor:** this is the most common. These GCs serve as managers overseeing and coordinating the project. They do not do any actual construction
- **Self performing general contractor:** Less common, but these GCs will “self perform” some parts of the construction project like framing or electrical

### Subcontractor (”Sub” or “Trade”)

An individual or company that specializes in one or multiple construction trades (e.g., framing, foundation, plumbing, etc.). They are hired by the GC to build a portion of the project

### Material Supplier

Almost always a company that procures, warehouses, and sells building materials

## A typical construction project

---

This is a watered down example that’s common on many multi-family and commercial projects. There are literally hundreds of variations of this model depending on the type/complexities of the project, contracts used and entities involved.

## Types of construction projects

---

### 🛁 Renovation

This typically refers to the renovation of a single family home, can be the entire home or a portion like the bathroom. 

Multi-family and commercial renovations are called Tenant Improvement (”TI”) and Rehab respectively. 

### 🏠 Residential or Single Family

Terms are used interchangeably. It refers to the construction of a home meant for the residence of a single family unit. This is typically a standalone house

### 🏘️ Multifamily

Construction of a small residential building meant to house multiple households. A small multi-family construction project is typically a set of connected townhomes or a small apartment unit. Another example is when a NYC brownstone gets converted into an apartment that houses 3 - 5 families.

Larger multi-family developments (5+ units, though there is no hard rule) are typically considered to be commercial projects.

### 🏢 Commercial

Construction of a large building that can be used for residential, retail or commercial purposes. Examples include: apartment complexes, office buildings, mixed use (retail + residential or retail + office), etc. 

### 🌉 Public / Infrastructure / Civil

Terms are used interchangeably. This category includes roads, bridges, hospitals, libraries, transit centers, etc.

## Relevant terms to know

---

- **Materials Takeoff:** the process of estimating the amount of building materials needed based on a set of drawings and specifications. This is usually done by an Estimator
- **Lien:** a legal right to possess a property until a debt or obligation is met. It’s very similar to a collateral. For example, if a material supplier provides materials for a project but does not get paid. They have the right to claim a portion of the building until they are paid. This is very problematic for the Owner
- **Lien Waiver:** A document that waives someone’s rights to possess a property. This document is used to indicate that a debt or obligation has been met. For example: after a material supplier is paid, they need to send a lien waiver to the Owner and waive their rights to possess the building
- **Pay Applications:** Refers to both a formal document and process used by contractors to get paid by the Owner. This is the main reason that contractors have a unique payment flow
- Construction Documents
    - **Blueprints / Drawings:** self explanatory, but comes in many levels of fidelity (see COD 100 - 400)
    - **Specifications:** a detailed list of “requirements” that accompanies and provides more details to the drawings
