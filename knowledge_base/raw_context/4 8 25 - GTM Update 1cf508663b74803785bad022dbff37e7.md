### YouTube Influencer Referral Program

- Planning to meet today with **Justin**, an influencer expert Ray connected me with
- **Main blocker**: the offerâ€”we need to finalize what exactly we're giving to influencers and referred clients
- Researched competitorsâ€™ referral/affiliate programs:
    - [**Bill.com**](http://bill.com/) and **Melio** both use **PartnerStack** (enterprise-level, likely expensive)
    - **Clay** uses **Rewardful**
    - Most cost-effective starting options:
        - **Rewardful** and **FirstPromoter**, both start at $49/month with no cost for sign-ups
- Created a comparative research doc outlining how much competitors offer to both the affiliate and the referred customer (happy to link/share)

### Reddit Monitoring Workflow

- Completed and documented the Reddit monitoring system
- Breakdown of workflows:
    - **Reddit Updates**: channel for hottest, most relevant leads (i.e. top-tier sales opportunities)
    - **Conversation Starters**: channel for potential engagement opportunities that need responses
    - **Competitive Insights**: channel for passive monitoringâ€”useful data but doesnâ€™t require action
- Doc includes structure, examples, and flow.

### Google Ads Update

- Launched **Performance Max campaign** (still in learning phase)
- First meeting with **US-based Google Ads rep**â€”not much feedback yet, but follow-up scheduled for next week
    - Rep has access to internal competitor insights (valuable intel weâ€™ve been waiting on)
- **Current issue**: Conversion drop likely caused by Googleâ€™s algorithm reducing bids due to lack of approved leads
    - Last approved lead: 5 days ago
    - Algorithm seems to have self-spiraled, reducing bids more and more
- Actions taken:
    - Turned both campaigns to **Maximize ROAS** (vs setting target ROAS), which should restart spend
    - May increase spend temporarily but should re-activate campaign traction
