# GTM Planning Meeting - Comprehensive Notes

**Date:** Monday, July 21, 2025

**Duration:** 01:35:45

**Participants:** Ivan LaBianca, Zak George, Colton O'Farrell, Miguel Vera

**Absent:** Jacob

## Executive Summary

The meeting focused on establishing clear HubSpot pipeline definitions, customer activation metrics, and deal prioritization processes. Key achievements included redefining pipeline stages, establishing activation thresholds (3 transactions OR $100+ total OR single transaction >$100), and identifying the need for automated workflows and notifications. The team also addressed compliance restrictions and the need to differentiate handling of inbound vs. outbound deals.

## 1. Marketing Updates and Traffic Growth

### Current Performance

- **Record organic traffic:** 741 visitors (highest ever) - 2x growth from 300s/month previously
- **ACH return code pages:** Ranking 3rd and 4th in search results
    - Expected to drive significantly higher traffic when reaching 1st position
- **Blog content gaining traction:**
    - "How to make large payments"
    - "How to pay vendors via credit card"

### Team Updates

- **New Webflow designer:** Francisco (Argentina) - completed credit card surcharging page templates on Friday
- Currently working on improved inbound forms to reduce support requests
- Plans to publish content "non-stop going forward" after resolving Webflow workflow issues

### Action Items

- [ ]  Finalize CTA update on credit card surcharging pages
- [ ]  Continue aggressive content publishing schedule
- [ ]  Francisco to build additional landing pages as specified

---

## 2. Growth Engine X Performance and Lead Quality

### Current Status

- **Scaling email volume:** From 1,500 to 5,000 emails daily
- **Lead quality validation:** Colton confirmed 4 out of 5 leads were solid ICP matches
    - Examples: Rope and wire distributor, roofing subcontractors
- **Scheduled demos:** 2 for Wednesday (including Prime Renovations in New York)

### Technical Improvements

- Eric implementing phone number capture for wholesale distribution campaigns
- Phone numbers will sync directly into HubSpot for immediate calling

### Deliverability Challenges

- 50% of emails hitting spam when Colton CCs himself from GetNickel domain
- Team agreed on immediate calling strategy when leads respond

### Action Items

- [ ]  Eric to implement phone number push to HubSpot for wholesale campaigns
- [ ]  Consider round-robin routing for Growth Engine X leads ($100/month via Outbound Sync)
- [ ]  Establish calling priority: 1) HubSpot inbound, 2) Growth Engine X responses (highest priority), 3) pending accounts

---

## 3. HubSpot Pipeline Stage Definitions

### Redefined Stages

1. **"Signed Up"**
    - **New definition:** Account creation only (not bank linking)
    - Previously conflated with bank account linking
    - Enables tracking of all prospects who create accounts
2. **"Activated"**
    - **Definition:** Meeting ANY of these criteria:
        - 3+ transactions
        - $100+ total transaction volume
        - Single transaction over $100
    - Move from focusing on bank linking to actual usage

### Key Decisions

- Sign-up stage captures high-intent activity regardless of approval status
- Activation focuses on actual platform usage rather than setup steps
- Approval/denial is a merchant status, not a pipeline stage

### Action Items

- [ ]  Implement automated stage movement when activation criteria are met
- [ ]  Create Slack notifications for approval/denial status changes
- [ ]  Build workflow to move denied accounts to closed-lost automatically
- [ ]  Special review process for outbound deals before denial

---

## 4. Customer Activation Metrics and Retention Indicators

### Magic Moment Analysis

- **Initial hypothesis:** Customers making transactions 30+ days apart show 90%+ retention over 6 months
- **Key insight:** Time between transactions more important than volume
    - Example: Bracket Storage - 53 transactions in <30 days before churning
    - Validates need for time-based retention metrics

### Proposed Metrics

- **Activation threshold:** 3 transactions OR $100+ total OR single transaction >$100
- **Retention indicator:** Transactions spanning 30+ days
- **Churn risk:** High transaction volume in short timeframe without sustained usage

### Future Considerations

- Separate "retention indicator" stage for long-term customers
- Automated alerts for churn risk indicators
- Power user identification (top 10-20% of users)

### Action Items

- [ ]  Miguel to complete retention analysis with MCP data scientist
- [ ]  Create automated workflows for retention indicators
- [ ]  Establish monitoring system for activated customers at risk

## 5. Pipeline Review and Deal Prioritization

### Current Challenges

- Too many low-value deals cluttering pipeline reviews
- Difficult to focus on high-impact opportunities
- Many inbound deals have small revenue potential

### Proposed Solutions

1. **Tier System Implementation**
    - Tier 1: High-value accounts (focus of pipeline reviews)
    - Tier 2: Medium-value accounts
    - Tier 3: Low-value accounts (tracked but not discussed)
2. **Deal Prioritization Criteria**
    - Estimated TPV (Total Payment Volume)
    - Company revenue
    - Strategic importance

### Colton's Deal Management

- Comprehensive notes and next steps maintained for all opportunities
- Challenge: Determining which deals deserve attention vs. tracking only
- Example: Happy Days Childcare vs. Wheeler Advertising (activated after guidance)

### Action Items

- [ ]  Establish deal tier criteria and thresholds
- [ ]  Create separate views or boards for different deal tiers
- [ ]  Define minimum TPV for pipeline review discussions
- [ ]  Schedule regular pipeline review meetings with tier filtering

---

## 6. Outbound vs. Inbound Process Workflows

### Inbound Process

- Comprehensive demo and self-service guidance approach
- Lower touch after initial demo
- Many small-value opportunities
- Challenge: Some high-value deals come through inbound

### Outbound Process

- Higher quality, pre-qualified leads
- Requires special handling for approval process
- Example: American Home Renewal successfully re-engaged after scheduling issues
- Need for fraud prevention without poor customer experience

### Key Differences

- **Fraud risk:** Primarily an inbound problem
- **Approval process:** Outbound deals need special review before denial
- **Follow-up intensity:** Outbound requires more persistent engagement
- **Commission impact:** Outbound typically higher value

### Action Items

- [ ]  Create outbound flag in HubSpot for special approval handling
- [ ]  Establish clear handoff process between sales and approval team
- [ ]  Define separate workflows for inbound vs. outbound deals
- [ ]  Implement notification system for outbound deal denials

---

## 7. Compliance and Prohibited Business Activities

### Prohibited Activities (Sponsor Bank Requirements)

- Cannabis and cannabis-related businesses
- Precious metals trading (raw gold, diamonds)
- [Full list shared in girls channel by Miguel]

### Examples and Edge Cases

1. **Raw Gold and Diamond company:** $50M revenue denied due to precious metals restriction
2. **Cannabis company:** Mistakenly contacted through Growth Engine X
3. **Defense contractors:** Acceptable unless transaction sizes exceed platform capabilities
4. **Multi-business companies:** May qualify if non-prohibited activities can be separated

### Key Clarifications

- Payroll tax payments to IRS acceptable
- Government payments generally acceptable
- Defense contractors not prohibited
- Jewelry sales (finished products) different from raw precious metals trading

### Action Items

- [ ]  Update Growth Engine X targeting to exclude prohibited categories
- [ ]  Create clear documentation for edge cases
- [ ]  Establish process for multi-business line companies
- [ ]  Train team on compliance requirements

---
