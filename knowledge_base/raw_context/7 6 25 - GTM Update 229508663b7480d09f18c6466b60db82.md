### Google Ads & Inbound Signups

Signups are climbing again. If not for the 4th of July, last week would have likely been our highest signup week ever. We expect this trend to continue as performance stabilizes.

- Google is now optimizing for bothÂ **approved signups**Â andÂ **form starters**, with the majority of weight still on approved but form start smoothing out the signal.
- Lead quality may dip slightly in the short term as the algorithm rebalances, but Iâ€™ll monitor closely.
- These fluctuations should become less noticeable as we scale spend postâ€“Series A. Larger budget = more signal = more consistency.

### HubSpot & Sales Ops â€“ Goals for This Week

If we can build a usable MVP, we can battle-test it with real inbound and eventually outbound activity. That will show us what works and what doesnâ€™tÂ *before*Â we lock in automations and reporting. Reporting can easily be backfilled if we're capturing the right fields along the way.

Based on our discussions, the top goals for this week in HubSpot are:

### Pipeline

- Build and battle test theÂ **new 5-stage deal board**:
    1. Interest Expressed / MQL (Marketing or Sales Qualified Lead); 10% probability
        1. eventually we have to track metrics on outbound sales vs outbound marketing activity
        2. account signup (?)
    2. Discovery Complete / Qualified (Sales Qualified Opportunity); 20%
    3. Demo Complete / Stage 3 and Onward (Potential Solution); 40%
    4. Account Approved / Potential Customer (Potential Activation): 60% 
    5. Activated (e.g. X transactions or $Y TPV â€” need to define)
- We can work deals through this live and adjust as needed.
    - adjust probabilities as we learn sql to sqo to
- **Update 7/8 on SOP**
    - Stage 1 = Interest Expressed = Marketing Qualified Lead or Sales Qualified Lead (MQL, SQL)
        - Deals move into Stage 1 if they come into contact with us via Inbound form, Automated Outbound, Ads, ChatGPT, etc. ALL **Interested** Leads go to Stage 1
        - Lowest level of probability to close (10%)
        - Eventually have to segment conversion from MQLs and SQLs (these are typically higher)
    - Stage 2 = Discovery Complete (Qualified) = Sales Qualified Opportunity
        - Only move from Stage 1 to Stage 2 when sufficient discovery has been done to justify an increase in the probability to close from ~10% to ~20%
            - % estimates will be revised after we see data waterfall from S1 to S2, etc. and so on.
        - ONLY happens when Discovery Conversation has been completed by AE.
    - Stage 3 = Demo Complete = Identified a Potential Solution
        - We have shown the platform and there is a potential solution to a pain identified by the AE and the prospect.
        - At this stage, we should have a complete fill out of the MEDDPICC fields or other methodology in the Deal Notes
        - Increase the probability of closing to 40%
    - Stage 4 = Signed-Up / Account Approved / Potential Customer (Potential Activation): 60%
        - Weâ€™ve identified a solution and have been convincing enough to earn a company sign up which we must nurture to develop into an Activated Customer
    - Stage 5 = Activated Customer
        - Customer has an account with Nickel and is using us to process payments on a regular basis.
        - At least 3 transactions within the platform (?)
        - 100% Closed Won and nurturing for Expansion
        - Need to know what the patterns look like, what the size of transactions are and

### Pages & Views

- Create usable views for:
    - Deal Board (Pipeline)
    - Deal Page
    - Contact Page
    - Company Page
        - Associate contacts with deals (automation?)

### Data & Routing

- Sync between company and contact records is now live so contact communication should be showing as long as the company and contact have the same email domain
- Miguel set HighTouch to run hourly updates so records should now show up-to-date product usage fields including but not limited to:
    - Total transactions
    - Average transaction size
    - First transaction date
    - Account type (free, pro, etc)
    - Account status (approved, pending)

If other fields are needed we can add them as needed. Note that some older accounts may have different data since the database has changed over time. Focus on new accounts when evaluating the sync and accuracy, we can sort out how to clean up old ones later.

- Christian and Jacob, whenever you are ready Iâ€™d like to setup lead routing setup to you:
    - Distribute inbound form leads
    - Distribute newly signed-up but inactive accounts
- This routing will allow us to battle-test the new deal stages and confirm the right entry points

### Reporting & Automation

- Once pipeline, structure, and views are working, it will be much easier to build reporting to track lead movement and outcomes. Many out of the box reports will work for us if we are collecting the right data on the front end
- Goal is to streamline click paths and capture sales activity with minimal manual entry

### Integrations

- **Iâ€™ll handle setup for**:
    - Smartlead
    - Google Ads, search console, website data and other sources needed for marketing reporting
- **Need support on integrating Nooks - We need to** decide on disposition options before integrating or else it will create a mess in HubSpot:
    - We should standardize 5â€“7 options that reflect clear call outcomes
    - Once Nooks is connected, we can push calls + outcomes directly into HubSpot and refine the workflow together
    - Need to test HubSpot Sequences/Nook integration

### Outbound Targets & Lead List Development

If we can finalize a broad outbound target list Iâ€™ll start running targeted ads as soon as possible to support outreach. Recommend first two campaigns:

- **Wholesale materials distributors:** starting with kitchen/bath, tile and flooring
- **Payment Network**: Vendors whoâ€™ve received payments via Nickel. This will require additional filtering and merging, but could be a strong source of warm leads.

### SEO + Content Publishing

- Target is to getÂ **150 programmatic posts live by end of month,** starting with credit card surcharging laws, then moving to invoicing guidelines by industry
- Recommend using blog page unless we can finalize or a simplified template within 48hrs to avoid any design/dev blockers
- Main priority right now is output and coverage to allow pages to index, we can polish later
