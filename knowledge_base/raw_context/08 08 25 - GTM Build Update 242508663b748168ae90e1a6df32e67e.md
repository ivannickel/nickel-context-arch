# 08/08/25 - GTM / Build Update

Area: üè¢ Company Wide
Owner: Miguel
Series: Weekly GTM/Build Update
Status: Published
Type: Update

**Goal:** Keep a tight feedback loop between GTM and product/build teams, share live insights, and have a little fun to wrap up the week.

---

### 1. üé• BizOps Overall Updates

### Customer Activation Focus (Miguel)

- So this week a big focus and theme was around getting customers to activate. While it's not bad, could always improve
- Therefore, this week a lot of work (at least Miguel's work) was determining our actual customer funnel/journey and identifying metrics to track for the improvements outlined below
- At this point, we'll probably just use before and after to evaluate but working towards doing more proper testing (A/B copy etc.)

### [Customer Journey Stages & Metrics](https://app.popsql.com/queries/-OX4djAqiLQpXpmNcpcH)

**1. Sign Up**

- **Metric:** Sign Up ‚Üí Link Bank Account Rate
- **Product Growth Improvements:**
    - Najeer's modal to display every time user logs in without linked bank account
    - Updated verification language to "tell us about your business" approach
        - Hypothesis: Verification language scaring users and why them feeling the need to be ‚Äúapproved‚Äù is arising and why they may not be advancing to next stage

            ![Screenshot 2025-08-08 at 2.23.02‚ÄØPM.png](08%2008%2025%20-%20GTM%20Build%20Update/Screenshot_2025-08-08_at_2.23.02_PM.png)
            

**5. Activated User (3+ Transactions)**

- **Sales Initiative -** #**new-nickel-users includes:**
    - New approved accounts
    - First-time bill pay transactions (vendor payments)
    - First-time get paid customer transactions (RCx)
    - **Goal:**
        - Contact new ICP customers ASAP in a more **CSM way** (in accordance with the ROE)
        - Source new qualified (business) accounts to the platform more easily
- **CSM Initiative (with Colton):** **Month 1 ‚Üí Month 2 Users** *(i.e.,  first transaction within the past 2 months, haven‚Äôt made one in the last 20 days)*
    - Purpose is to:
        - Testing [HubSpot email features](https://app.hubspot.com/email/47449442/edit/194151230767/preview) to transition away from [customer.io](http://customer.io) and strengthen getnickel.com domain reputation
        - Re-engage customers for this bottom funnel and truly activate
1. **Overall Metric that Tracks the Entire Journey** 
    1. **Sign Up to 1st Successful Transaction Rate**
        
        
        | 0 - 30 days ago | 18.73 |
        | --- | --- |
        | 31 - 60 days ago | 25.00 |
        | 61 - 90 days ago | 31.65 |
2. **Ask:** Keep sharing **low-lift, high-impact ideas** for customer activation (especially product growth related ideas and related to number 2)

### Business Email Requirements Update (Miguel / Ivan)

**Current Challenge**

- Total Signup has increased significantly, but this is driven by [**free emails** vs. **business emails**](https://app.popsql.com/queries/-OVPcZnjDDo5RW7Hq2Qm)
    - *Note: We‚Äôve seen cases where someone signs up with both personal and business so just forces them to use business emails for higher intent*
- [**Data**](https://app.popsql.com/queries/-OTVgBcgE_Gdf-xagLxZ) shows business email + website = significantly higher activation rates

**Proposed Solution**

- Website requirement remains optional BUT **incentivize business email signup**
- **Error Message:** "Must be a valid business email. [Link to Contact Us Form]"
- **Process:** Sales team follows up to relevant contacts

### 2. üì£ Marketing/Growth Metrics (Ivan)

- Highest Organic Traffic to Date
    - 1100 last week vs 820 previous week
    - Mostly power by new silo on CC surcharging
- In Progress Marketing Initiatives:
    - Case Studies - Christian & Jacob
        - Jacob working on Archadeck case study materials that him and Christian will work on to be used as templates for other deals
    - ACH limits by bank
    - Industry Pages Template, starting with Roofers
- Increasing visibility on LLM‚Äôs especially GPT5 core model
    - Current content strategy is 100% focused on search, AIO and LLM brand or feature mentions. Not general content

- Pending/inactive accounts triage process
- Churn/at risk customer process and dashboard

### 7. üîú¬†Recap / Next Steps

- **Figure out the DENIAL Process**
    - **Problem:** Pending customers who we try to activate ONLY to be denied afterwards - bad user experience
    - **Potential Changes:**
        - Pre-Education around usage
