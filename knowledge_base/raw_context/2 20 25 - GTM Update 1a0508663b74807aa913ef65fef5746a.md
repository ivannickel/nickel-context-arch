### **Facebook Ads Limitations for Targeting Accountants**

### **Reddit Strategy Exploration**

    - Best practices suggest using both individual and company accounts for credibility.
    - Self-promotion is banned in some subreddits but allowed in others as long as the ratio of self-promotion to other posts is less than 9 to 1
    - Tested F5 Bot for monitoring mentions.
- **Next Steps:**
    - Decide on an official Reddit strategy: individual accounts, brand account, or both.
    - Identify key subreddits where engagement would be valuable.
    - Set up a streamlined monitoring and engagement process.
