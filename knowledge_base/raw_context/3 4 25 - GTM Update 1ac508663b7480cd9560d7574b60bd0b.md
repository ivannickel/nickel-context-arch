### **Fixing Conversion Tracking & Visibility**

- **Biggest blocker:**Â Current tracking is unreliable, preventing Google Ads and manual optimization.
- **Issues Identified:**
    - We need to trackÂ **where conversions drop off**Â (e.g., at bank information step?).
    - Conversion values are set atÂ **$600 for an approved lead, $20 for a signup**â€”but we donâ€™t have enough approved leads yet to optimize effectively.
    - **Yesterdayâ€™s data discrepancy:**Â 18 signups in Google Ads, but only 10 real ones in the platform (including 2 test signups).
- **Action Items:**
    - [Assign Owner] Fix sign-up conversion tracking to ensure accuracy.
    - ImplementÂ **Zapier to feed activated deals**Â back into Google Ads.
    - **Ensure Google Analytics tracks drop-offs**Â to see where users abandon the process.
    - Build outÂ **clear attribution tracking**Â to differentiate high vs. low-quality campaigns.

### **Scaling Google Ads Effectively**

- **Current Focus:**Â Google Ads only (to keep things simple before adding other channels).
- **Future Plan:**Â Multi-channel expansion, but only after tracking is fixed.
- **Observations:**
    - **Massive delta**Â between high and low-quality leadsâ€”campaign optimizations could significantly improve ROI.
    - **New shared budget setup**Â with Google optimizing for conversion value.
    - **Need more signups feeding into the algorithm**Â since approved leads are too few for accurate optimization.

### **Organic & Inbound Growth Strategy**

- **Short-term:**
    - Publishing theÂ **Trade Credit Blog Post**Â as an inbound experiment.
    - TrackingÂ **organic lead volume and quality**Â from this initiative.
- **Long-term:**
    - SEO strategy for high-intent keywords.
    - Building out moreÂ **educational content**Â targeting construction and bookkeeping audiences.

**Action Items:**

- Finalize and publishÂ **Trade Credit Blog Post**.
- MonitorÂ **organic traffic & conversion impact**.
