# Nickel + Daydream |  Strategy Session

---

## Background

Nickel is a modern B2B payments and credit platform built for businesses that make large, invoice-based payments ‚Äî especially those operating in the physical economy. Our users include contractors, wholesale distributors, suppliers, and manufacturers ‚Äî companies that often have a small head count but often move tens of thousands to millions of dollars each month via ACH, credit card, checks, or manual invoicing.

A large portion of these businesses offer or rely on¬†**net terms**¬†‚Äî delivering goods or services up front, and waiting 30, 60, or even 120 days to get paid. This structure creates a massive burden: businesses are forced to act like banks for their customers, taking on credit risk, collections overhead, and strained cash flow. We believe this dynamic is the root cause of the¬†**$3+ trillion working capital gap**¬†in the U.S., and one of the biggest sources of financial friction in the B2B economy.

Nickel starts by solving payments: we offer same-day ACH, credit card acceptance, and check processing (including scanning and mailing), all built on top of simple, flexible AR/AP tools that integrate directly with QuickBooks. Most customers start with payments ‚Äî either AR, AP, or both ‚Äî and adopt more advanced functionality over time.

Once they‚Äôre up and running, businesses can use Nickel to¬†**evaluate customers, extend terms with confidence, and access advances on unpaid invoices** giving them control and flexibility over how and when they get paid.

### **SMBs Processing Large Invoice Based Payments**

- Think: contractors, distributors, material suppliers ‚Äî anyone doing big invoice-based payments.
- They usually don‚Äôt use a POS or API (and we don‚Äôt offer either) ‚Äî they're still mailing checks, using bank ACH, QuickBooks Payments, or tools like [Bill.com](http://bill.com/).
- We're often replacing [Bill.com](http://bill.com/), Melio, or manual processing via bank.

## Product-Led SEO Experiments

- Some of our customers use **custom payment pages** like [this one](https://pay.ndemnifly.com/)
    - These are thin now but starting to rank ‚Äî likely because our customers often don‚Äôt have a strong web presence
    - Curious if this could be leveraged at scale for backlinks or traffic
- We‚Äôre also considering **customer spotlight content or directories** ‚Äî similar to what Melio did with their [marketplace](https://meliopayments.com/marketplace/)
