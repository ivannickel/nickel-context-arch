# GTM plan draft 9/5/25

Owner: Ivan LaBianca
Status: Not started

## Context & Strategic Objectives

Hey team, with the raise of our 11m Series A, I wanted write down some preliminary thoughts on how we can get to the next milestone. As Ray outlined in the investor memo, since launch, **Nickel’s** **Annual Payment Volume has grown 125x** with **241% retention after nine months**. We’re on track to exceed **$1.25B TPV, a $4M run rate, and 2,000 active businesses by the end of 2025**.

What makes this even more exciting is where the growth is coming from. More than half of our signups are through **organic, direct, or “unknown” channels,** people finding Nickel on their own, for free... That’s with only about **6K site visits a month**. Bill.com, by comparison, has over **1M organic visits monthly**. If this is what we can do with tiny traffic, the ceiling is extremely high.

Looking ahead, the goal is clear: get past **$2B TPV by Q1 2026**, and then **$6–10B by the end of 2026**, as Ray outlined in our investor memo. This document lays out my thoughts on how we can get there, starting with a high-level summary, then the tactics, the resourcing and timeline, and finally the risks and contingencies we should plan for. Please add comments and feedback so we can sharpen it together.

## Executive Summary

Our path to **$2B+ TPV by Q1 2026** rests on a three part self reinforcing growth loop.

**1. Diversified Inbound**

Net new users discover Nickel first through **AI search and LLM ranking**, reinforced by **SEO and referrals**. We will continue layering in **paid ads** to amplify what is working and expand into **brand building campaigns and PR** over time. This diversified inbound engine creates predictable demand and establishes long term authority.

**2. Targeted Outbound and Payment Network Activation**

Through **automation**, we can maximize our **payment network** and surround high value accounts with **vertical specific outreach, ads, and direct mail**. The goal is smart marketing that supports sales by making Nickel appear everywhere prospects look, projecting far beyond the size of a **10 person team** and building **trust at scale**.

**3. Systematic Cultivation of Customer Advocates**

High value customers receive **red carpet onboarding** to strengthen retention, then become part of a **noisy customer base** that fuels growth through **reviews, case studies, referrals, and social proof**. This feeds directly back into the **inbound flywheel**.

### Strategic Objectives

- **Drive TPV from ~$450M to $2B+ by end of Q1 2026** through scalable GTM motions
- **Increase activation rates** over the same period
- **Expand our presence in core verticals** (construction, distribution, wholesale, trades) through vertical specific content creating, account based direct outreach, and referral/activation motions
- **Build compound growth loops,** referral, viral, and SEO, that scale efficiently as volume and brand recognition grow
- **Position Nickel for multi-product expansion** later in 2025 (collections, corporate cards, working capital) by building out demand through content and brand

## **Three-Layer Growth Loop: Inbound, Targeted Outbound, Customer Advocacy**

### **1. Drive Net-New Traffic via Performance Marketing & Organic Inbound**

**Goal**: Generate predictable, high-quality lead flow by publishing high-conversion content and scaling paid campaigns

---

### **A. Organic (Google, AIO, GEO, etc)**

Focus: Publish and rank high-conversion content that drives compounding, cost-effective inbound interest via LLMs and Google Search

**Tactics**:

- **Programmatic SEO**: Target “ACH return codes,” bank limitations, “best payment platform for [industry]” queries, and comparison pages (e.g. Nickel vs Stripe).
- **Vertical-Specific Landing Pages**: Continue building conversion-optimized pages for HVAC, kitchen suppliers, distributors, etc.
- **Press & Thought Leadership**:
    - Series A announcement, market category framing.
    - Industry benchmarks: “State of B2B Payments 2025,” etc.
- **YouTube & Podcast Placement**: Founder interviews and customer case story appearances drive branded search and trust.

**Needs**:

- **Sustain publishing velocity**: Editorial + programmatic engine must keep pushing ~10–20 pages/week.
- **Support from PR/content partners**: More firepower on industry thought leadership, case study production, and long-form assets.

### **B. Paid/Performance Marketing**

Focus: Paid campaigns that reach high-intent buyers and feed rapid feedback loops for creative testing, landing page optimization, and conversion tracking.

**Channels & Tactics**:

- **Google Search**: Core paid acquisition engine currently with room to expand beyond competitor and “ach” related terms
- **YouTube & Meta Ads**: Significant upside but limited by current attribution gaps and lack of creative. Also requires much more active management/Time for execution
- **Vertical specific campaigns**: Run paid and outbound campaigns that point directly to industry-specific landing pages (e.g. “Nickel for HVAC contractors”)

**Bottlenecks**:

- **Attribution is still fragile**: Multi-channel conversion tracking is not fully wired into Postgres/HubSpot. First-click and lead source data are often lost.
- **Creative pipeline is thin**: We need consistent fresh pipeline of visual assets for Meta and PMax campaigns to be efficient. Generally creative performance drops off in 4-6 weeks a the best results come from testing widely
- **Execution bandwidth**: TOFO and MOFO ad’s campaigns with visual creative have the benefit go building brand recognization while generating conversions, but require much more direct management. It may make sense to invest in a part time performance marketing manager to scale

---

### **2. Targeted Account-Based Marketing + Warm Lead Acceleration**

**Goal**: Surround high-value accounts with vertically relevant outreach, ads, and follow-up. Shorten the sales cycle and increase conversion rates by maintaining persistent visibility across multiple touchpoints.

---

### **A. Targeted Cold Account Outreach (ABM)**

Focus: Precision-target high-LTV verticals with layered outbound, direct mail, and retargeting to build familiarity and drive conversion.

**Execution Plan**:

- **Right now, Zach is doing outbound to an overly broad list of industries and Titles. With clay, we can build much more targeted lists and pre-research the accounts so that he can do much higher quality outbound outreach**
- **Build cold account lists by vertical** (e.g., HVAC installers, plumbing wholesalers, kitchen/bath distributors).
- **Enrich via Claygent** for:
    - Company size + vertical alignment
    - Personal email addresses
    - Physical mailing addresses
- **Run vertical-specific outbound** campaigns (email + cold calling) via Nooks, HubSpot, and SDR/AE follow-ups.
- **Direct Mail Layer**:
    - Send 6×8 postcards with vertical-specific copy.
    - Trigger mail based on outbound stage or via website visit enrichment.
- **Ad Layer**:
    - Serve industry-specific display and video ads across Meta, YouTube, and LinkedIn.
    - Reinforce Nickel’s vertical fit and trustworthiness.

**Dependencies**:

- Creative assets tailored to each vertical (both static and video).
- Dedicated outbound bandwidth (Zaki, Colton, AEs).
- Systems integration: enrichment → CRM → outbound/ad targeting → reporting.

---

### **B. Payment Network + Inbound Visitor Follow-Up**

Focus: Convert warm leads (signups, site visitors, network invites) who don’t immediately convert by wrapping them with personalized follow-up.

**Execution Plan**:

- **Auto-enrich inbound signups and visitors** with Clay.
- **Tag ICP-fit warm leads** who:
    - Signed up but didn’t finish onboarding
    - Visited key pages (pricing, ACH/CC product pages)
    - Received invites through the payment network but didn’t convert
- **Add them to vertical-based nurture sequences**:
    - Direct mail
    - Display/video ad retargeting
    - Personal AE/SDR follow-up
- **Deploy “Why Nickel” landing pages** and value props tailored to their industry.

**Current Bottlenecks**:

- Not all inbound activity is being enriched and routed automatically.
- Limited reporting visibility on ad engagement from this cohort.
- Bandwidth constraints on timely follow-up.

### **3. Red Carpet Activation + UGC Loop**

**Goal**: Turn every great customer into an advocate. Make the most valuable accounts feel seen and supported, while extracting maximum social proof, content, and amplification from their experience.

---

### **A. Red Carpet Activation**

Focus: Deliver high-touch onboarding and personalized support for top accounts to improve activation, retention, and willingness to promote.

**Execution Plan**:

- Identify ICP-fit signups (by volume, industry, or influence).
- Prioritize them for:
    - **1:1 onboarding calls**
    - **White-glove support** (e.g., handholding through setup, answering ACH/CC questions)
    - **Follow-ups from AE/CSM based on usage**
- Route to account owner with:
    - Pre-filled Clay/CRM enrichment
    - Suggested touchpoints (onboarding lag, first payment sent, churn risk, etc.)
- Use onboarding as a moment to gather **valuable data** for GTM:
    - Industry, tools used, pain points
    - Interest in sharing publicly, testimonials, referrals

---

### **B. UGC + Advocacy Engine**

Focus: Encourage and enable customers to create social proof across multiple surfaces.

**Execution Plan**:

- **Case Studies + Logos**:
    - Publish short customer stories as blog posts and videos
    - Repurpose onboarding anecdotes into written wins
    - Route for reposting on LinkedIn, Reddit, YouTube
- **Review Campaigns**:
    - Capterra, G2, Google, Trustpilot
    - Post-sale and milestone-triggered outreach
    - Offer incentives or thank-you gifts
- **Badge Program**:
    - Offer “Nickel-Verified” or “Preferred Vendor” web badges
    - Include SEO-optimized backlink to boost domain authority
- **Reddit + LinkedIn Seeding**:
    - Identify Redditors and social users in our base
    - Softly encourage posts in r/smallbusiness, r/accounting, r/entrepreneur, etc.
    - Equip them with talking points, memes, and support docs
- **Press + PR**:
    - Publish 1x/month press releases on new products, milestones, customer wins
    - Outreach to trade publications, fintech newsletters, and podcast hosts
    - Position Nickel as both a tech and small business success story

**Dependencies**:

- Dedicated owner for content + UGC
- Creative assets (video templates, quote graphics, etc.)
- List of high-potential users for activation
- Strong coordination with support/success for follow-through

## Resourcing

**Software**

**Ad Spend**

**Talent**

To execute this plan, we’ll likely need to add targeted support either in the form of contractors or full time. Area’s we could invest:

- **Performance Marketing:** If we want to move beyond search marketing we could benefit from having a dedicated performance marketer
- **Ads, Video and Webdesign:** Generating and refreshing visual assets is key for scaling Meta and Pmax ads, creating visual assets is currently a bottleneck
- **Content & Writing**: Phase out Contact Studios and bring on a dedicated writer who can focus on case studies, and thought leadership. Jenica could help with PR outreach to extend the reach of these efforts
- **GTM Engineering**: phase out Growth Engine X and bring on a more dedicated GTM engineer to help us build internal systems such as inbound lead scoring/enrichment, support automation, sales automation, etc

## Sequencing/Sprints

**Days 0–30 (Sprint 1)**

- Add **contract design support** for ads, landing pages, and creative refresh.
- Bring in **contract performance marketing support** to run structured ad tests and improve reporting.
- Have **Jenica** take ownership of **review outreach** (Capterra, G2, Google, Trustpilot) and begin QA on **AI automations** for inbound triage and lead routing.

**Days 31–60 (Sprint 2)**

- Onboard a **dedicated writer** for SEO/GEO, case studies, and thought leadership.
- Continue Jenica’s **review outreach** and expand her role to cover **sales process automation backstop**, checking AI workflows and lead scoring outputs.
- Establish a more formal **Customer Advocacy motion** (case studies, referrals, noisy customer program), supported by the writer.

**Days 61–90 (Sprint 3)**

- **Start PR outreach and backlink generation**
- Potentiall bring on a **dedicated GTM engineer or contractor** to design outbound automation, retargeting flows, lead scoring paid retargeting, and data integrations.

## Risks & Mitigations (Outline)

**1. AIO/SEO/AI Discovery Shifts**

- *Risk*: AI search (AIO/LLMs) and Google SEO may get harder to rank in as competition increases and algorithms evolve.
- *Mitigation*: Invest early in authority (backlinks, PR, advocacy content), diversify across channels (paid, referrals, outbound) so we’re not overly dependent on any single chainel , and monitor emerging AI search platforms closely.

**2. AI Reliability & Process Risk**

- *Risk*: Dependence on AI workflows (lead triage, scoring, outbound) could break or deliver false positives/negatives.
- *Mitigation*: Maintain human backstops (Jenica and team QA), build redundancy into systems, and prioritize GTM engineering for monitoring and alerts.

**3. Outbound Saturation**

- *Risk*: Outbound response rates could decline as more companies flood inboxes, ads, and phones.
- *Mitigation*: Differentiate with vertical-specific creative, mix in direct mail and multi-channel touches, and cultivate based of warm leads so we don’t have to depend on pure cold outreach, (payment network, cold outreach to site visitors, etc)

**4. Customer Advocacy & Reviews**

- *Risk*: Negative reviews or lack of participation could dampen trust and slow growth loops.
- *Mitigation*: Deliver red-carpet onboarding, incentivize positive reviews, respond quickly to negatives, and bake advocacy prompts into product flows.

**5. Support Scaling**

- *Risk*: Support capacity doesn’t keep up with growth, leading to slow response times and customer churn.
- *Mitigation*: Automate tier-1 support, expand help resources/self-service, and plan ahead for scaling human support bandwidth as TPV grows.

**6. Paid Ads & Rising Costs**

- *Risk*: Ads get more expensive over time since they are auction-based; CAC could climb as competitors bid aggressively.
- *Mitigation*: Use ads for amplification rather than dependency, double down on SEO and AI-first inbound, and continuously optimize creative to maintain efficiency.
