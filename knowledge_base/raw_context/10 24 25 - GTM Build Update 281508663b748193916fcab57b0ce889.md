## **2. GTM Observations (25 minutes)**

### **Long-Term / Bigger Projects**

- **POS**: By adding the ability to store line-items with prices inside Nickel, it can make it easier for high value retail operations to leverage us at Point-Of-Sale. Existing use-cases.
    - **Abel Richard:**¬†Surgenex owner is starting a line of luxury products $200k+ to be sold in-store. Instead of using Lightspeed POS for processing, they'll be using Nickel on an ipad to send custom invoices.
    - **Weaver Hardware**: Referred by Chicago Brass, Weaver is using Nickel for in-store purchases, custom quoting products and sending invoices.
    - **Lighting NY**: 50/50 remote invoices and in-person in-store sales.
    - **Product Next Steps (Long-Term)**
        - Nickel Mobile App
        - Increase Credit Card Usage
- **"Typeform for Payments" :**¬†This idea can generate more traffic from mid-sized businesses looking for a quick in-field or in-person payments solution that can lead to self-service upgrades into wider AR/AP.
    - [**Powerhouse Electrical**](https://www.powerhouse-es.com/): Whale that inbounded seeking in-person payment portal to replace Zelle/Paypal. Easily upsold into AR Invoicing for Mid-Sized accounts.
- **Survey**: We should do customer surveys that center on fast settlements, no long-term payment holds that are often experienced by competitors like Melio and¬†[Bill.com](http://bill.com/), and our fast customer support experience as competitors undergo changes that will increase delays in Customer Service and provide bad experiences.
    - **Content/Social Focus**
        - Pains people experience with other platforms
            - ‚ÄúWe have good customer service‚Äù
            - ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt hold payments‚Äù

### **Shorter-Term Projects/Fixes**

**1. Increased Insights & Tracking**

**Invoice Email Tracking**

- Track when invoices are opened
- Monitor engagement with invoice emails

**Transaction Analytics**

- Identify who pays on time (good customers)
- Track what vendors Nickel merchants pay late

**2. New Features**

**Bulk Debit Authorization Charge**

- Enable processing multiple debit authorizations simultaneously (e.g., Butter Freight - 45 invoices to same customer, Alliance Homecare)

**Accounting Firm Multi-Client Access**

- Invite team members with access to specific clients only
- Members can only see details for their assigned 'child' company rather than entire accounting firm

**3. QuickBooks Integration Enhancements**

**Refund Process Improvement (OB Sod, Alliance)**

- Create a new transaction or line item for refunds
- Rather than 'void' or alter the original payment

1. **Delete account permissions (Bob‚Äôs HOA)**
- A customer deleted their account by accident. Sounds like they were trying to test some things and one of them was if they¬†could delete the account as a member.
- We might want to think about only allowing an administrator to delete an account.

1. **Add due date visibility or auto-selection on the payment screen (GRA Services International)**
- When a user clicks ‚ÄòMake Payment,‚Äô the due date should either show clearly or automatically prefill as the payment date. Right now, it defaults to ‚ÄòPay ASAP,‚Äô so users must click back to check when it‚Äôs actually due.
