### 🌱 Organic: AI Snippet Win + Traffic Compounding

- We’re now ranking in the **AI answer box for “free ACH payments”** — a major visibility milestone.
- We had **2 non-branded leads in a single day** from organic yesterday.
- Based on current momentum, we’re on track to bring in **30+ organic leads this month** from non-branded terms.
- Content work from Contact Studios is ramping up — early deliverables are in progress.
- We’re laying the groundwork for this to compound MoM.

### 🔧 Outbound

- Lead list from Michael was shared, but Ray mentioned they **can’t provide opt-outs**.
- This creates **some compliance and deliverability risk** if we run cold campaigns without suppression.
- Need to align on how to treat next steps

### ✅ Jenica - Onboarding

- Jenica is doing really well — thoughtful, reliable, and responsive.
- She’ll be helping with:
    - **Lead flow tagging** (CRM cleanup and source tracking)
    - **Review campaign execution** (G2, TrustRadius, Capterra outreach + status tracking)
    - **Influencer outreach tracking and coordination**
- Needs:
    - **Payment (via Mercury)**
    - **Slack + company email setup**
    - Goal is to plug her into more projects this week

### 📈 Google Ads Performance

- We’re starting to see better results in Google Ad — CAC is down to ~$500 in ads but likely lower. My educated estimate is that we’re paying **~$300-$350 per approved lead**, factoring in untracked conversions.
- Improvements likely due to:
    - Restored conversion tracking (Learning phase completed)
    - New signup flow (CRO updates from Claudio+Najeer)
    - New campaigns and revised ad text rolled out this month
- **Open question**: At what point is it profitable to scale ad spend further?

### 🧪 Experiments + Ops

- Looking into spinning up **Bing Ads** as a low-CPC complement to Google — early signal is it’s 60–70% cheaper per click, and aligns with our demographic (desktop-heavy, older B2B)
- Plan is to clone campaigns and track performance in parallel, using Zapier to get conversion tracking synced
