Greater Insights & Tracking

| **Distinguish between invoices paid using Nickel**

Paid via Nickel (payment link) vs. Marked as Paid (outside Nickel), with QuickBooks sync

*Christian, Surgenex ($100M)* | 3 |  | "Paid outside Nickel" exists for Bill Payments but not Invoices. Shouldn‚Äôt be too difficult to implement.
