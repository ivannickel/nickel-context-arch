### 1. üé• **Demos & Calls Recap**

- Kick off with a quick overview of recent demos. Uploaded all demos this week and identified the following:
    - **ERP Integration** - Direct integration with specialized ERPs like DynaScape (David - Colton) to eliminate multi-step workflows through QuickBooks
        - Payroll I know might be a future feature
        - Xero Integration talk track?
            - Cloud ERP - ‚ÄòAI‚Äô Agent
- Anecdotal things we heard on calls (anything else?):
    - API bs
        - **Good APIs** - Create invoice, send payment requests
- **Divine Design Center Case Study - Feature Improvements**
    
    **1. Show Which Description Field Appears in Payment Confirmations (Invoice Purpose vs Note to Customer)**
    
    When Rose creates an invoice, there are two places to write what the payment is for. She doesn't know which description customers see when they get their payment receipt, so she has to write the same thing twice.
    
    **2. Make Customer Email Address Optional**
    
    Rose has to enter a customer email address (she enters her own) even though she doesn't want Nickel to send emails directly to customers. She prefers to send invoices through her own QuickBooks system:

### 2. ü§ë¬†Sales/GTM Updates

- **Website Form (Sign Up / Contact Us) Optimization**
    - Adding strategic friction to improve lead quality:
        - Business Type Drop Down (industry segment / function)
        - Long Term
        - **Tradeoff -** Worth the trade off of better leads but more drop offs in the sign up process
        - **Reintroducing EIN (screen out sole proprietors) - Register**
    - Single Form
        - Ivan is working with a new WebFlow individual/agency and it should be easier to create a single form which I think will help
        - Can do things like below
            
            ![Screenshot 2025-07-18 at 12.43.39‚ÄØPM.png](07%2018%2025%20-%20GTM%20Build%20Update/Screenshot_2025-07-18_at_12.43.39_PM.png)

### 3. üõ†Ô∏è **Support Update (Will)**

- **Pending State - Clear Process**
    - Lets go over what the user sees, what pending is used for right now and why it shouldn‚Äôt be something to worry about!
    - **From GTM team:** Why have customers been asking ‚Äòam I in pending‚Äô?
        - Is it **fraud**? Are they familiar with other products?
        - **UI/UX - Too Frictionless?**
            - More explicit onboarding?
            - Guide them more
    - **Prioritization**
        - Colton called out Rudy Polwin (Perfect Example of Pending Account Conversion)
            - I think sorted by number of transactions in the For Review tab could be helpful
    - **Clear Process**
        - 
- **Overall Aim:** How to bridge the gap between approval process and sales **(CONVERSATION)**
    - Examples
        - [Prestigious Travel Club](https://app.getnickel.com/dashboard/admin/cmb9vujfp00030802q77k3lqa) - $1,200,000 Revenue with 40% Credit Card Usage
    - **Suggestions / Potential Solves (Based on Ray‚Äôs Insights)**
        - For instance, Ray just identified an interesting trend where 23% of customers don‚Äôt make it past Month 1 BUT if they stay past Month 2, they remain 90%-95% onwards
            - 100 people in Month 1, 23 drop off by Month 2 (23 customers drop off)
            - If you stick past Month 2,
        - **Miguel Investigation:** How does this change at every month or number of transactions (e.g., 2 vs 3 - is there a big dropoff?)
        - **Impact:** Expand focus from 0 - 1 transactions to 1 - 3
            - Define ‚Äòactivated‚Äô

### 4. üñ•Ô∏è **Product & Tech Team**

- **Treat Parent Accounts (not highest priority, could be helpful Hubspot end)**
    - Ray loosely talked about **Workspaces** (although complex)
    - **Workaround -** Accounting Profile but no Accounting ID
- **Workspaces (Complex - Is it a priority?)**
    - Colony Cooks Venice, LLC & Colony Cooks, LLC
    - New workspaces for existing part of a company
    - Solve parent accounts
- **Payment Portal / Website - Jacob**
    - [Courier Systems](https://nickel-org.slack.com/archives/C04B00VLQL8/p1752696941545159) (Jacob) $5M - 20M range but bad website
    - Adding an about us and contact us section to the payment portal (so they can use it as their website)
        - ‚ÄòLite‚Äô payment portal extension **(Linktree)**
    - **IDEA**
- **Remote MCP Server (Ivan) & Integration with Nickel Database - Cuts out middlemen, Reduces steps (PopSQL)**
    - **GTM Team -** Upsell opportunities, lead scoring (especially with the potential inclusion of more friction and datapoints), **pipeline dropoffs/usage trends (mentioned above)**
        - **Note:** While Miguel still investigate these things,  MCP could make it easier
        - Especially if integrated with Hubspot for follow-up actions
        - Find similar customers - Workflow, checks database to find similar ones
    - **Run with Pipedream** - To check database for **duplicates** and flag
        - Automation from Hubspot
    - **Spike in approved accounts from Gmail**
    - **Tech Team:** How much of a lift is this?
- Open floor: Any **technical Q&A** the sales team wants to ask or clarify?
