# 3/18/25 - GTM Update

Area: 🤑 Revenue
Owner: Ivan LaBianca
Series: Weekly GTM Update
Status: Published
Type: Update

### G2 Review Campaign

- We now have 29 live G2 reviews, with 2 more expected soon
- Strong response to incentives; still managing payouts and follow-ups
- Recommendation: Going forward, default to **Amazon gift cards** instead of Nickel transfers for simplicity
- Next step: Expand review asks to Capterra, Trustpilot, etc., and automate via Customer.io

### G2 Advertising: Early Data

- Spent $333.54 on G2 click ads to date
    - 21 total clicks → 1 form fill (not high quality)
    - Clicks came from:
        - 5 on the Melio comparison page
        - 2 on the QuickBooks page
        - 1 directly from our own profile
        - Remaining from general “Payment Processing” category
- Live click ads maintain a direct link to our site, which could support SEO + discoverability
- Next step: Meeting scheduled with G2 rep to understand optimization levers and platform updates
- Recommendation: Keep minimal spend live on the Melio page for now

### SEO & Site Optimization

- Ran full Ahrefs site audit and improved site health score from 35 → 86
- Expect improvements in:
    - Site crawl speed
    - Indexing
- Lays foundation for ranking across the board

## Google Ads: Optimizations & Learnings

### Recent Optimizations

- Cleaned up negative keywords and made structure improvements across campaigns
- Shifted campaign optimization from **weighted full-funnel conversions** to focus **only on approved signups** (our ultimate goal)
- This aligns targeting with actual revenue-driving conversions

### Performance & Observations

- There is an expected **learning period** for the new bidding strategy
- However, over the past four days, we’ve seen:
    - A potential **drop-off in approved leads**
    - **Higher cost per approved signup** than desired, despite increasing spend
    - Signs of **less efficient bidding behavior**
- I’ve been actively reviewing keyword performance and making adjustments

### Additional Signal

- This week, we saw **10 new form fills** from paid search — a meaningful uptick from the previous week
    - Includes a **cosmetics manufacturer** that completed signup
    - While we’re not explicitly bidding for form fills, the change in optimization may be increasing mid-funnel interest

### Next Steps

- Continue monitoring performance through the learning period
- If results don’t improve in the next few days, we may consider reverting to the prior weighted funnel strategy
- Will also look at better qualifying and following up with demo/contact leads from these forms
