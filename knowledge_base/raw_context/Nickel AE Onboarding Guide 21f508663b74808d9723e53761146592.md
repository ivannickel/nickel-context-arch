# Nickel AE Onboarding Guide

Owner: Ivan LaBianca
Status: Draft

**Welcome** This onboarding document provides a brief overview of Nickel’s go-to-market motion, key systems, resources, and goals. It is a living document and will be updated regularly as we scale.

## Current GTM Motion: Overview

Nickel’s go-to-market is anchored in a product-led, self-serve motion, amplified by outbound and paid acquisition. Here’s how new customers typically discover and engage with us:

### Inbound (Top of Funnel)

- **Organic Search (SEO):** Growing fast. We rank #1 for "Free ACH" and related terms, plus rank top 10 for competitive queries (e.g. Quickbooks ACH fees, Melio alternatives).
- **Product & Feature Pages:** Capture bottom-funnel intent.
- **Blog & Comparison Content:** Built out to support informational and mid-funnel queries.
- **G2:** Strong momentum. We’ve risen to 9th out of 500+ payment processors. G2 reviews have directly driven high-quality leads.
- **Reddit:** We monitor and engage in relevant threads (ACH, payment platforms, QuickBooks issues). It’s a great window into real pain points.
- **Paid Search:** We’ve started dialing up spend (Google Ads, Facebook) as of late June — it’s hammer time.
- **Referrals & Direct Traffic:** Meaningful driver. Often people hear about us from existing customers.

### Inbound Forms (HubSpot)

- *Request a Demo* ("Talk to a Human")
- *Contact Us* (Customer support + general questions)
- *Accountants Page Form* (Dedicated to accounting partners)

All inbound leads flow into the `#inbound` Slack channel for visibility and triage.

## Outbound Motion

Outbound is early for us but ramping up fast. Zaki and Colton have been leading the charge so far. We’re excited for you to help us build a stronger outbound motion. 

## Outbound Targeting Strategy

Our total addressable market is very large. Our plan is to use a three tiered approach:

1. **Top-tier accounts** (larger mid-market): Targeted outreach, AE-led research, outbound campaigns.
2. **Mid-tier accounts:** SDR or AE-led outbound with limited research. Often ~5–50 person companies doing $2M–$20M in revenue.
3. **Lower-tier/long-tail:** Email only, automated, or push to demo/video content.

Mixing large and mid-sized accounts helps ensure momentum and a diversified customer base while also building a pipeline of strategic logos.

## Tools & Stack

- **Nooks:** Used for cold calling, call coaching, and tracking. AI objection-handling, call recording, and auto-dialing features.
- **Apollo:** Currently used for lead sourcing and sequencing in Nooks, may switch to HubSpot+Nooks for call sequencing. Currently single login setup.
- **HubSpot:** Currently a manual process is used to bring leads in when interest is expressed. Documented here: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kfe_I3Ery7YHpBy4n2tEw7O0NM00pqV6bMGyZQi8l50/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.100ub4bqbke2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kfe_I3Ery7YHpBy4n2tEw7O0NM00pqV6bMGyZQi8l50/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.100ub4bqbke2)
- **Zoom:** Used for scheduled demos, internal syncs, and customer-facing calls that require screen sharing or multi-party collaboration.
- **Calendly:** Used to schedule inbound and outbound meetings. Integrated with reps’ calendars to eliminate back-and-forth.

## Scripts

Evolving but this is what we’re currently running:

- [Nickel Cold Call Script V7 - Colton Style](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15umDaUaF2KQz81FCyByMWyoDa9QNbfqVM2HoP3lr4-0/edit?usp=sharing)
- [Cold Call Script for Nickel (Wholesaler Edition – AB 2991 Style)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-WJtu8D52x3aUwx0V99DoIf6TiJ8thLJ6ZrdO92fvbI/edit?usp=sharing)
- [Nickel Demo Script](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1856vU6Irj6q81H4Ab2JexSdQxhjMdsw4_Nt6PUreGy8/edit?usp=sharing)

## **Objection Handling:**

- [Nickel Cold Call Objection Handling](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zdYc6P3ujgI3d045ODxXwxjAEByBCOWhGx0hDeB_-5w/edit?usp=sharing)

## What’s working

- **Self-serve enablement assets** - people are busy, make it as easy as possible to self serve
    - Meetings are hard to book. Nearly everyone will accept an email and watch a 5-minute demo if they are interested
    - [Nickel Free Setup Guide (Step-by-step account setup + QBO integration)](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGqhmEx1cY/g0VAHl9j6hPxjOUvUHHcLg/edit?utm_content=DAGqhmEx1cY&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton)
- Inbound is gaining serious traction (SEO, G2, AI, Reddit, direct referrals)
    - Leverage social proof - “Are you familiar with G2? (most are not)”
- Cold calls are converting well when targeting QuickBooks Online ACH users, Melio, or [Bill.com](http://bill.com/). People also use their banks for ACH and are typically charged a flat fee around $30
- Our script and pitch resonate most when we lead with outcome (“are checks slowing down your cashflow?”) vs. process
- Simple email and/or text follow-ups and same-day recap emails after a meeting with demo link + merchant setup instructions are driving action
    - **Know your target audience** and how they work
- The free ACH and pass-through surcharge angle consistently hits pain points for QuickBooks users
    - You will face a lot of skepticism. Frame free ACH as a smart business decision by Nickel to fill market gap and provide immediate benefit to small businesses. Happy customers are your best marketing, Nickel leads with that.

[20-minute meetings work well for inbound demos. Agenda](https://www.notion.so/20-minute-meetings-work-well-for-inbound-demos-Agenda-222508663b7480a58e91cbbb80fa9f25?pvs=21)

## What’s not working

- Cold call scripts were initially too long-winded, making it hard to keep conversations on track
- ICP boundaries are still too loose; we’re wasting cycles on money movement companies, crypto, or international merchants that aren’t viable (but the network effect brings good customers and if they are paying we don't mind)
- Deal stages (especially for outbound) aren’t clearly defined or enforced
- Key resources like call scripts, demo videos, setup guides, and objection handling are still being improved
- Prospect objections and feature asks (e.g., receipts, end-date toggle, multi-user access) aren’t being captured consistently or escalated to Product/Engineering
- There is no routing or filtering system to weed out unqualified or spammy inbound leads
- **Too much setup kills momentum**
    - Long-winded intros (e.g. legal/regulatory context before pain) tend to lose attention fast. Tighter openers with immediate relevance perform better.
- **Leading with ‘free ACH’ creates skepticism**
    - Starting with “free” language without context often sounds too good to be true or triggers disbelief, especially with contractors and suppliers.
- **Talking fees too early raises resistance**
    - Brings up objections prematurely if they haven’t yet acknowledged a pain with checks or their current processor. Fee passing works better once pain is clear.

### How you can help

- Learn and run the current process
- Help identify friction in process
- Collaborate on refining call scripts, email sequences, and follow-up plays
- Suggest tooling improvements

## Marketing Support

- Once key account lists are finalized, we can begin targeting with:
    - Paid ads (Google and Facebook)
    - Direct mail
    - Warm email touches and retargeting

This works best when combined with outbound activity. If a prospect sees a Nickel ad or postcard and then hears from you, conversion rates go up.

## Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

### Core ICP Buckets

1. **Check-heavy businesses:** Haven’t adopted ACH, value simplicity
2. **ACH + check users:** Often frustrated with clunky bank interfaces or QuickBooks fees
3. **QuickBooks ACH users:** High intent, pain-driven. They pay 1% fees, and we eliminate that

### High-Value Verticals

- Wholesale Distributors (Tile, kitchen hardware, plumbing)
- Logistics and freight services
- Construction material suppliers
- Manufacturers accepting large invoice payments

### Customer Pain Points

- ACH fees from banks or QuickBooks
- Manual entry, security risks sharing bank logins
- No easy way to pass through credit card fees

---

## Self-Serve and Activation

Many signups come via self-serve and activate with no AE interaction.

### Activation Flow

- Create an account → Connect bank and QuickBooks → Attempt payment
- At that point, they are reviewed and either approved or denied.
- Claudio and Will oversee fraud review and approval.

We’re now starting to automatically push these users into HubSpot for nurture, follow-up, and outbound campaigns.

**🚨 Fraud Risk** Fraud and account takeovers are a major concern. We use Alloy for risk screening.

- Some businesses pass basic checks but trigger Alloy fraud risk.
- When in doubt, we may call the main business line or investigate further.
