# 4/1/25 - GTM Update

Area: ðŸ¤‘ Revenue
Owner: Ivan LaBianca
Series: Weekly GTM Update
Status: Published
Type: Update

## Key Wins & Highlights

- CrossedÂ 100 new customers this month?
- Got ourÂ first customer via ChatGPT referral
- Non-branded organic traffic continues to climb
- Branded search continue to climbÂ without major new investment â€“ strong sign of word-of-mouth + brand lift

## Content & SEO

- **Organic content is starting to work**
    - Published 7 long-form articles in the past 10 days
    - Already seeing keyword pickups and traffic growth (including some surprising long-tail wins)
    - The articles areÂ high quality, manually researched, and iterative â€“ most donâ€™t trigger AI detection tools
- **AI Search Visibility & Long-Tail SEO**
    - Met with 4 vendors:
        - Contact Studios: $24.3K for 200 programmatic blog posts (~$120/article)
        - Daydream: $30K for up to 1,000 blog posts (~$30/article), starting with 100/week after ramp-up
        - AirOps's internal partner agency: ~$10K/month for 100 articles
        - Content Distribution: $10K/month for 10 long-form blog posts (highly researched, premium quality)
    - Exploring how to capture long-tail traffic via programmatic SEO without triggering penalties or hurting DA
    - **Discussion point**:  Pages from SMBs using Nickel areÂ **ranking for their business name + payment platform**, which could be leveraged more strategically
- **Content Strategy Decision**Â (to discuss)
    - **Option A**: Scale with a vetted vendor (Contact Studios or Daydream)
    - **Option B**: Build content internally for more control + reduced risk (slower, but higher quality)

## Performance Marketing & Growth Experiments

- **Google Ads**
    - Switched back toÂ **Target ROAS**Â bidding and added aÂ **two-step funnel**Â (with incentivized signups as the first conversion point)
    - Reason: Time-to-approval for "Approved Conversions" is too slow for Google to optimize effectively
    - Goal: Get more data faster and improve ROAS over time by feeding Google more conversion signals
- **Facebook/Meta Ads**
    - Conversion tracking is approved
    - Planning to launch aÂ **targeted campaign**Â this week
    - Meta recommends refreshing creatives every 3 weeks â€” asset production may become a bottleneck
- **Display Retargeting**
    - Prioritizing Google Display retargeting campaign this week

## **Listicle Outreach**

- Kenneth building list of "best payment platform" roundups + contact info
- Goal: get Nickel listed on 2-5 of these pages via direct outreach

- See list here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Zy_k7_S7SPCfDMbrZVwLh08TSVCZOV1fTzLBXBYzETI/edit?gid=339389578#gid=339389578
