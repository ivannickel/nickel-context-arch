### Marketing & SEO

- **Industry Pages**: Finalized structure for roofing and distributor pages. Fran is executing on rollout. Objective is to dominate intent-driven SEO for trades and wholesale verticals.

- **ACH Limits SEO**: Initial SoFi page is already ranking and getting clicks. 85 ACH return code pages scheduled for publication within 10 days.
- **Search Intent Strategy**: Actively targeting keywords around large payments and industry-specific invoicing (e.g. "$100k ACH," "best way to invoice HVAC job") to own high-intent queries.

### Inbound GTM Infrastructure

- **Attribution & Source Visibility**: HubSpot pipeline now tracks revenue attribution across PLG, sales, outbound, and GrowthEngineX.
- **Inbound Lead Triage**: AI prompt developed to auto-assess lead quality and estimate company size based on website content. Use cases include:
    - Signup triage
    - Payment network enrichment
    - Anonymous web visitor analysis

### Outbound Sales & Database Building

- **GrowthEngineX**: High-potential accounts like American Renewal and Top Job are now active. Value-add: building a CRM database of email-verified contacts at target companies.
- **Cold Email Targeting**: These pre-enriched contacts now allow for triggered outreach and follow-up campaigns without additional enrichment steps.

### Activation & Customer Marketing

- **Lifecycle Emails**: Customer.io → HubSpot migration planned. This will centralize lifecycle marketing flows for activation and engagement.
- **Review Campaign**: Planning to relaunch G2 review solicitation as an automated flow post-activation.
- **LMM Ranking Strategy**: G2 reviews are also core to improving visibility in ChatGPT and other AI-driven search platforms.

### Sales Development

- **Nooks Adoption**: Team engagement has been minimal; prefer personal dialing/HubSpot, should assess contract
- **Zach's Outbound**: Limited traction despite some meetings. Potential repositioning toward accounting/AP targets where outreach is more relevant.
- **Accountant Channel**: Reconsidering accountants as potential multipliers, especially for growing AP-side adoption of the payment network.

### **New Form + Clearbit Auto-Enrichment**

- We’re launching a simplified lead form:
    - Only requires email and a short question category (support, demo request, callback request, or product question).
    - The rest is auto-filled via Clearbit (company, role, etc.).
- This will reduce friction, improve conversion, and still allow for intelligent routing to AEs or support.
- It also opens the door for using AI to triage inquiries automatically.

### **Considering HubSpot for Support**

- Benefits:
    - Centralized lead + support visibility.
    - Easier to assign revenue influence and close the loop between issues and product team.
    - More robust automation + AI handling potential.
- Will has expressed concern about mixing "church and state," but the lack of visibility into frontend issues is a growing risk
