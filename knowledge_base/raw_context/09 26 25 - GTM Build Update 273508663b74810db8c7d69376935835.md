## **2. GTM Observations (25 minutes)**

### Longer-Term Projects

*(Organized in order of biggest unlock for GTM in terms of customers)*

**1. QuickBooks Desktop Integration (#1)**

- Highest impact for customer acquisition and retention
- Addresses major "Feature Gap" issue

**2. Xero Integration (#2)**

- Second-tier accounting integration priority
- Expands market reach to Xero users
- Xero becoming more prevalent
- High credit card businesses may be more likely on Xero?

**3. Trade Credit**

- Significant feature gap for B2B customers
- Unlocks new customer segments requiring credit terms

**4. BNPL (Buy Now, Pay Later) - Wishlist**

- Market expansion opportunity
- Consumer-facing payment flexibility

### Shorter-Term Projects

**1. Retail Customer Portal**

1. Where non-Nickel account retail customers can login somewhere and see all the pending invoices rather than locate multiple emails
2. **Current gap**: Customers have to locate multiple emails instead of centralized access and both delays payments and burdens support

**2. Custom Payment Portal Improvements**

1. See requests like change "Reason for Payment" to be Accounting Number or Invoice Number 
2. Already on the roadmap
3. **Impact**: Not the biggest unlock since people for the most part are using the payment portal correctly

**3. Automated Reminders**

1. Automatic Invoice reminders (as opposed to pressing reminder, especially useful for people who don‚Äôt login to Nickel)
2. Similarly, automatically reminder vendors to fill out their account details

**4. 2FA via Phone or Authenticator App Requested**

1. Currently, we have SMS on Request
2. **Impact:** Likely not the biggest unlock BUT it does help towards Nickel‚Äôs brand positioning as a secure platform

## **3. Miguel‚Äôs Messages**
