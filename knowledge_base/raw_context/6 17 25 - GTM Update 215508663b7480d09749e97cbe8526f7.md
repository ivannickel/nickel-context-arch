# 6/17/25 - GTM Update

Area: ðŸ¤‘ Revenue
Owner: Ivan LaBianca
Series: Weekly GTM Update
Status: Published
Type: Update

### **CRM + HubSpot**

- **Made huge progress this weekâ€”led by Miguel**
- Pipeline + deal stages are now set up with lifecycle statuses mapped (MQL, SQL, Opp, etc.)
- Inbound forms areÂ **in progress**, created by Ivan and Flowout, and nearly completed
- First version of the deal board is live; some small changes still needed
- Colton and Zach are nowÂ **tracking emails**Â directly in HubSpot
- First iteration of HighTouch is syncing data from the app to HubSpot

**These are major steps forward.**

Next phase is testing and refining through real usage so we can:

1. Quickly identify the highest-value leads and engage with them
2. Assign ownership and follow-up to ensure conversion
3. Nurture long-term interest in a timely and structured way
4. Get clearer visibility into trends

### **Growth Engine X â€” Cold Email**

- Campaign launched yesterday (basic version) â€” no replies yet, but weÂ **may be seeing some lift in engagement**
- Still very early stage in terms of messaging quality
- Will keep iterating on copy, offer, and segmentation to improve results
- One idea to test:Â **send $25 demo incentive payments via Nickel**Â to show product value and drive attendance (ICP only)

---

### **Programmatic SEO â€” ACH Return Codes**

- 32 ACH return code pages are now live and being dripped out
- Ivan is mapping the next set of pages and plans toÂ **publish 3â€“5 pages per day**Â over the next two months
- Expectation is that these pages will driveÂ **meaningful traffic growth**Â and increase inbound lead volume

---

### **Direct Mail**

- First design is back â€” targeting launch of aÂ **direct mail campaign for a lead list**, likely focused on New York area
- These leads have also received cold emails
- Goal is to warm them up ahead of AE outbound follow-up

---

### **Outbound Sales + AE Ramp**

- **Inbound volume alone wonâ€™t support AE success**Â â€” outbound needs to be cracked and systematized
- Still working on getting aÂ **clear sales cadence and messaging framework**Â in place
- We've seen early signs of success, but we need a more deliberate structure around testing and tracking whatâ€™s working
- Inbound has been the most straightforward path so far, and Colton has started helping with inbound triage (great training mechanism)
