### 1. 🎥 **Demos & Calls Recap (Colton, Zak)**

- Kick off with a quick overview of recent demos. Uploaded all of Colton’s demos this week and identified the following:
    - **Bulk Invoice Operations** - Process multiple invoices simultaneously instead of one-by-one
    - **Payment Expiration Alerts** - Proactive notification before payment methods expire
    - **Enhanced QuickBooks Desktop Integration** - Automated sync instead of manual CSV uploads
    - **Variable Recurring Billing** - Handle consumption-based billing with changing amounts
    - **External Payment Authorization Forms** (outside of Nickel, both physical and digital)
- Does this match what Colton and Zak are hearing on calls?

### 2. 🧰 **HubSpot Updates (Jacob, Christian)**

- Quick walkthrough of what’s new in HubSpot for visibility across teams:
    - Pipeline stages: what they mean, how we're using them.
    - The information we will now be tracking for each company (Qualifying Details, MEDPICC)
        - Example: Break Point – a manually backfilled record by Colton.
        - Example: Southern Botanicals - inbound Jacob took today
- Builder-side input:
    - Any other information that the builders think would be vital to know or include in the notes?
    - Would feature/improvement field be too much? Which fields should we be looking at? (e.g., Botanicals talk about physical payments)
- ***If there’s time -* Hightouch Sync (Miguel)**: Short update on what’s syncing
    - Take last 30 days of transaction, actual estimated annual transaction volume (extrapolate)

### 3. 🛠️ **Support Update (Will)**

- Top issues this week: any pain points not already raised by sales?
    - 
- Intercom setup & tickets:
    - While it be useful, probably not the most important thing at the moment.
    - Sales Team - do you think it’s absolutely necessary for tickets? To me, Intercom isn’t used as much for ‘leads’ but perhaps later down the line when it’s more of an upsell motion.
- **Hubspot Setup Tickets**
- **QBD Integration:**
    - Timeline update.
    - Will is tracking QBD interest via Intercom manually [via this page](Quickbooks%20Desktop%20Email%20Requests%20list%20223508663b7480029fdcccf073dbafec.md)
    - GTM side: Track this in “competition” field - Want an easy way to track customers that we can immediately go after this is live.

---

### 4. 🧪 **Product & Tech Team**

- Recent launches (from Najeer’s update): Recurring Invoices, Save Customer Payment Methods, Scheduled Payments.
    - Sales team: Have people been bringing this up? You can say Nickel can address these.
- Coming soon (based on whiteboard priorities): Check Deposit (AR) - **3 months after platform**, Nickel Balance, Payment Timeline.
    - Anything from this meeting and week’s calls that suggests we should change this roadmap?
- Open floor: Any **technical Q&A** the sales team wants to ask or clarify?

---

### 5. 🔁 **Process Going Forward**

- First time running this meeting—feedback?
- Want to find a sustainable way to capture feedback during the week:
    - Forms? Probably too heavy.
    - Slack channel? Maybe not.
    - Miguel will keep informally gathering notes and now start adding more structure perhaps via HubSpot (as opposed to Circleback).
