### 1.Â **Google Ads (Search + Visual)**

- Itâ€™s hammer time. I started dialing up spend on Google Search ads last Friday and it looks we we got some solid lead flow yesterday and today.
- In parallel, Iâ€™m building a creative pipeline so we can begin running:
    - **Branded image ads**Â for Performance Max
    - **Reel-style YouTube campaigns**Â (simple, product-led, similar to Melioâ€™s free ACH ads)
- This will let us target our ICP more effectively, including campaigns focused onÂ **California-based wholesalers**.

### 2.Â **Wholesale Vendor Outreach â€” CA Liquor, Wine & Spirits**

- **Jenica**Â has built Apollo lead lists focused on California wholesalers in liquor, wine, and spirits.
- This is tied to the newÂ **California law AB-2991**, which creates a time-sensitive wedge to position Nickel.
- Weâ€™re also drawing cold call scripts + email sequences to support this push.
- This is aÂ **high-potential wedge**, and we should go hard this week.
- Weâ€™re also going to haveÂ **Growth Engine X run a campaign to this segment**Â to reinforce the message and hit the window while itâ€™s hot.

### 3.Â **HubSpot + AE Onboarding**

- Colton had a packed calendar this weekâ€”encouraging signal.
- HubSpot forms are working well; still refining some areas, but weâ€™re in a strong position to start onboarding AEs.
- This next phase will battle-test the new lifecycle flows and deal handoff process.

### 4.Â **Outbound Email (Growth Engine X)**

- Met with Growth Engine X yesterdayâ€”theyâ€™re spinning up new campaigns to test several offer types.
- IncludesÂ **incentive-based outreach ($10, $25, $50 via Nickel)**Â to wholesale materials distributors and high-fit targets.
- Will run this at small scale to validate engagement and conversion.
- As noted above, theyâ€™ll also begin targetingÂ **California wholesalers**Â given the urgency around AB-2991.

### 5.Â **Programmatic SEO â€” New Silo Prep**

- Iâ€™ve mapped out our next content silo focused onÂ **credit card surcharging laws**Â and related queries.
- Working with Contact Studios now to launch these pages.
- Will follow the same drip cadence as the ACH return code content, and help pull in highly qualified traffic.
