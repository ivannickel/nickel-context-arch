## 1. üéØ **CSM Motion Progress (Colton)**

Colton starting to run with new CSM motion. In particular, we're focussing on the onboarding process of new customers then will move into **growth** (i.e., upselling of current customers, getting AP customers to use AR etc.)

### Customer Segmentation & Intelligence

With a combination of Ivan's Clay and unmatched Filipino intelligence, we're tagging new customers that come in appropriately:

- **Result**: We are now segmenting customers for different drip campaigns (i.e., Fish and above have access to Colton)
- **Next**: As we test this out, we can start implementing it for existing customers to help Colton with tiering the existing customers

### Customer Onboarding Journey Choices

Customers who have access to Colton now have a choice between their own onboarding journey:

- **1 week, 1 month and 3 months**
- Each with own designed checklist or 'homework' intended to ensure that customers are more bought in and engaged

### Sales Enablement Tools

- Working on designing an email ([work in progress](https://app.hubspot.com/design-previewer/47449442/code/195617453902)) template GTM team can easily access
- Down the line, Colton will also work on an Executive Business Review for these customers (including this internal savings calculator that sales team have developed)

## 2. üìã **HubSpot Quality of Life**

### Migration Progress

Have almost fully migrated Calendly and Customer.io to HubSpot so we can think about shutting those down potentially next week:

- No new inbounds are coming from Calendly (reduce seats there)
- Emails from Customer.io are just finishing their journeys

## 3. üõ†Ô∏è **Tech Updates**

Lots of sexy back end stuff

- Claudio Increase implementation
- Collecting reasons for disconnecting QBO
    - Right now it's in slack, but can use that for GTM team later on
- International Payments coming

## 4. üìà **Marketing Updates**

**Clay Enrichment v1: ICP Fit & Revenue Tiering**

- Launched a fully working v1 of our **Clay-powered enrichment engine** for inbound signups and partner leads.
- Key workflow capabilities:
    - **Website finder**: Finds missing websites and confirms the domain is live
    - **Revenue search**: Searches ZoomInfo first, then falls back to secondary sources like Clearbit or Apollo
    - **Agentic browsing**: Crawls the company‚Äôs website to assess industry category (trades, construction, industrial, etc.)
    - **ICP scoring**: Tags accounts as ICP/Non-ICP and assigns a **Revenue Tier** (Shrimp, Fish, Whale, Kraken) aligned with Colton‚Äôs CSM segmentation.
- Future extensions:
    - We can add webhook access to **app data** (e.g. bank balance) to inform pre-qualification
    - Pull data from **150+ sources** via Clay‚Äôs integrations
    - Scrape the web with **LLM post-processing** to dynamically identify use case, role fit, and fraud risk

**Organic Traffic: Another Record Week**

- **1.21K clicks last week** ‚Äî our highest-ever week of organic traffic, up from 1.1k last week.
- Key drivers:
    - Ongoing publishing of **ACH limits** pages
- Up next:
    - **Industry-specific landing pages** (‚ÄúNickel for HVAC‚Äù, ‚ÄúNickel for Construction‚Äù, etc.)
    - Content template complete
    - Blocker: awaiting Fran‚Äôs completion of new Webflow **template shell** before rollout

**Google Ads: Campaign Rebuild + Tracking Fixes**

- Rebuilt all Google Ads campaigns last week after form updates triggered **Learning Phase resets**
- Note to self to check conversion tracking after all form changes
- Actively resolving conversion tracking:
    - Goal: **track conversions** all the way into **HubSpot** even when leads complete sign-up inside the app (post-redirect)
    - Exploring native app-to-HubSpot conversion logging or form mimic via backend

**Quality of life Slack <> HubSpot Lead Routing**

- New Slack-to-HubSpot workflow for **Payment Network leads**
    - Trigger: Slack emoji adds the lead to HubSpot with relevant tags
    - Reduces friction for team, faster lead capture

**Future: Enrich/target payment network leads**

- Enriching Payment Network leads with **personal emails**
    - Personal emails perform better for **ad targeting** and **match rates** on Meta/LinkedIn
- Next stage: **address enrichment** for direct mail
    - API-triggered postcards or mailers
    - Sequenced after approval or engagement

## 6. üö® **Big Topic: Support/Denial Process**

So received two negative G2 reviews this week that has made us rethink the denial process

### Problem

**Example Case**: My account was open for 5 days. I sent a customer an invoice to request a payment. Now, Nickel denied my company and I have to request an invoice from my customer again which is very unprofessional

- *"Despite receiving a payment, no red flags were raised before or within the five days my account had been open."*

On top of that, I was dismissed (referred to a competitor) and not given a reason as to why.

### Solution - Introduce a Request for Information (RFI) State

We're creating a new approval state called RFI (request for information). Customers who are not fraudulent, but high risk will be placed in this category instead of being outright rejected

### When a customer enters the RFI state, they will:

- **Receive an automated email** from Nickel letting them know that "we try to support all SMBs, but have a high bar to keep product affordable. So we need XYZ information from them."
- **See a closable modal popup** when they log back into the dashboard. This modal will reiterate the same language as the email. They can close this modal and continue to use the platform, but this modal will reappear every time they log back in and all backend payment settlements are disabled. This means, they can create more payment links and submit more payments as usual, but no money is being transferred until they've provided the info required and are approved
- **We will cc CSM team** in this communication

### Two Outcomes to the RFI State:

1. You've provided the info and are approved/denied
2. You don't provide any info and your account is put in a holding pattern. We can subsequently close any accounts in this state after X days

### Questions/Items to Confirm

1. **What qualifies for an RFI?**
2. **Make sure it's clear no money is being transferred** - Can imagine scenarios, knowing our customers, where they ask "my vendor hasn't received money" or "where is the payment a customer provided"
3. **What additional information do we need post RFI?**
4. **What is the volume going to look like?**

**Definition of RFI
- Government Issued ID**

Proof of Business Address

Certificate of Information

**Ideas**

- **Post Deny (**Thump up and down immediately after (prevent online))
    - Request a call post denial
- **Sync support and sales**
- Ask for revenue in onboarding?
- Deny them on the call
    - Did you make account with Nickel?
    - Tell me about your business
    - Tell me about customers/vendors
    - How did you find us?
- **Authenticated with Plaid**

### 9. üîú¬†Next Week

### AskElephant Tool Testing

GTM Team testing out a new tool called AskElephant that may replace Circleback:

- **Main advantages**: Syncs with HubSpot directly, with out of the box recipes that can help with MEDPICC for sales, product feedback for engineering team
- **Internal calls** -
