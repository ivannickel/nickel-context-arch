Area: 🤑 Revenue
Owner: Ivan LaBianca
Series: Weekly GTM Update
Status: Published
Type: Update

### HubSpot + Sales Enablement

One of our **top priorities right now** is making sure HubSpot is **fully up-to-date and optimized**. We’re actively working through:

- Finalizing **deal stage definitions** and deciding whether to use **one or two pipelines**
- Clarifying the use of **lifecycle stages** vs. **lead statuses**
- Standardizing **activity tracking**, **note-taking**, and AE workflows
- Building **dashboards** to track pipeline health, AE performance, and handoff quality

Getting this system right is critical as we scale AE coverage and continue to push high-volume lead gen.

### Wholesale Vendor Campaigns — CA & Beyond

Jenica finalized Apollo lead lists for **California liquor, wine & spirits wholesalers** impacted by the new **AB-2991 EFT regulation**. This gives us a strong time-sensitive wedge to position Nickel ahead of the July 1 deadline.

Zach made calls last week to wholesale distributors — we’re reviewing the results and checking for booked demos.

Growth Engine X is currently running two test campaigns to **wholesale materials distributors** this week. These campaigns:

- Pull in each company’s **product type** and **end customer**
- Test two copy angles: **ACH savings** vs. **payment flexibility and fee-passing**

---

### Outbound — Offer Tests + Persona Targeting

Growth Engine X is also going to run a targeted outbound into **wholesale distributors** (finished goods, tile, kitchen and bath)

We’re testing **incentive-based messaging** ($25-$50 sent via Nickel) to drive demo volume and give people a firsthand look at how easy the platform is to use.

Copy variations focus on:

- Eliminating ACH fees
- Speed of transfers
- Ability to pass card fees

### Programmatic SEO — New Silo Launch

We’ve mapped out our next content cluster focused on **credit card surcharging laws**, including:

- State-by-state legality
- Fee-passing strategies
- Related regulatory and “can I charge a fee” search queries

This silo complements the ACH return code pages and helps capture mid-to-bottom funnel traffic from finance leads with high purchase intent.

We’re working with **Contact Studios** now to publish the first batch.

### June Metrics Snapshot

We closed **127 new approved accounts in June**, despite a drop in overall approval rate.

Approval rate fell from ~50% to **34%**, a **~25% relative decline**. Still strong volume, but we’re reviewing the flow to identify ways to improve conversion rate and lead quality moving forward.
