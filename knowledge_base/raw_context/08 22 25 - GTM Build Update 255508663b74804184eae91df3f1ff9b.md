### 1. üöÄ [Single Form Launch](https://www.getnickel.com/form-test)

**The Problem:** Having multiple forms would result in people not using them correctly (e.g., sales requests going to support, support requests going to sales)

**The Solution:** One unified form with Clearbit autofill that reduces friction and intelligently routes users to the right experience for better conversion

**Five Form Paths:**

- **Callback** - Simple, lightweight option (saw an example today where prospect just wanted a call)
- **Demo** - Heavier form with qualification questions for seriously interested prospects
    - *Goal:* Reduce low-quality demos and improve conversion quality
- **Support** - Direct routing to Intercom conversation (no more AE misdirection)
- **Customer Feature Request** - Routes to Colton/Miguel for proper handling
    - *Curious to see adoption on this one*
- **Contact Us/General Inquiry** - Also routing to Colton/Miguel

**Expected Impact:** Better user experience + cleaner lead routing + reduced support burden on AEs + reduced sales going to support

### 2. üìà G2 Campaign Launch

**Campaign Details:**

- Ivan launched a new review campaign via Lemlist targeting activated users (3+ transactions to cast a wide net)
- Targeting G2 (most importantly), Capterra, SourceForge reviews
- Miguel handling requests and audit process

**Strategic Importance:**

- Boost rankings in AI tools discovery (seeing many customers already coming from these channels)
- **Critical:** G2 reviews directly impact visibility in ChatGPT and AI-driven search platforms
- Last campaign was in May - timing is right for a push
