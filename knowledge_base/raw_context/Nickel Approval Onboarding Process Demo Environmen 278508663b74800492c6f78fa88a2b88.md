## **Meeting Objective**

Decide ***how*** to implement a demo/exploration environment for new signups before full platform approval (similar to Mercury/Stripe model). In other words, reveal that there is an approval process to users.

***To keep this focussed, we won't be talking about support treatment for different customer tiers (that's a related BUT separate project)***

## Next Steps / Questions

1. **Engineering**
    1. What data carries over from demo environment once account is approved?
2. **GTM**
    1. Revenue identifies whales/shrimp at signup 
        1. Could result in some lying about revenue
        2. Alternate Option: Leave **Book Onboarding Call** on for everyone then ChiliPiper screens who gets access to a calendar **BUT** requires additional form which adds friction
    2. Help determine language
3. **Support**
    1. Do unactivated shrimp get human access or only knowledge base articles + Fin AI (with potential escalation)?
    2. Can we deliver 24-hour approval turnaround consistently?

## **Appendix**

## The Problem & Why This Matters

### 1. Reputational Risk

Users think they're approved → send invoices → get denied → look unprofessional

1. G2 review confirm this frustration
2. FounderFirst (Mireya)

### 2. Trust & Commitment Building

Companies won't commit without understanding platform functionality, and limited support access creates friction for prospects

## First Principle

**Nickel's Competitive Advantage: Honesty & Transparency**

*Unlike competitors, we serve industrial SMBs with no hidden fees and no complexity. A demo environment reinforces our transparency and lets customers experience our easy-to-use platform firsthand.*

## Pros & Cons

### Pros

1. Ideally reduces customer frustration by setting clear expectations upfront
    1. “No means no” - Fewer customers appealing their case
    2. Understanding of the rejection 
2. Allows prospects to fully evaluate platform before committing
    1. Reinforces our transparency positioning vs competitors

### Cons

1. Potential conversion rate impact from added friction, leading to people giving up
    1. **Mitigant:** We can now focus on higher intent customers and provide better service

## **Questions to Answer**

1. **What would the demo environment look like?**
    1. Is it just the pending? 
    2. Is it a ‘true demo’ environment where you can see payments complete and show up?
2. **Expectation Impact:** Which metrics can we expect to drop? By how much?
    - **# of Signups:** Might not even drop (demo reduces signup friction)
    - **# of Activated Accounts:** What to mostly look at - but many companies take long to activate anyway
3. **Success Metrics:** What do we need to track to know this is working?
4. **Demo Exit Criteria:** When do users move from demo to approval?
    - After they link bank account and we say "we'll get back to you within 24 hours"?
    - After they send the first transaction?
        - If so, need to make it **absolutely clear** that it's not sent out yet (like RFI)
        - And it'll only be sent out if account is approved
    - What time frame makes sense for account approval? 24 hours?
5. **Messaging Language:** How do we set proper expectations?
    - **Overall Messaging:** Verified/Exclusive
    - Banner: "You're using test data. To send and receive payments, complete your business profile"
    - When transactions are made: "Your request to send or receive a payment is taken for review. Our compliance team will review your information within 24 hours."
6. **Support Limitations:** Do we limit support to demo users? Push towards Fin AI?
    1. ***Broader Scope Question (Careful - might go too wide)***
    - If they're not going to be qualified anyway, should we spend time there to save both sales and support's time
    - For CSM, only reach out to approved ones
