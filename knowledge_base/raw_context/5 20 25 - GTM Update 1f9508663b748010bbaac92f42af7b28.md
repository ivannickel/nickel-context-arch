# 5/20/25 - GTM Update

Area: ðŸ¤‘ Revenue
Owner: Ivan LaBianca
Series: Weekly GTM Update
Status: Published
Type: Update

Here's a quick roundup of GTM progress this week. We're making good strides across outbound, SEO, conversion, and review ops. Prioritized by strategic impact and areas of momentum:

---

### **Review Campaign Relaunch â€“ Multi-Platform, Up to $75**

We launched a new review campaign to boost our presence across G2, Capterra, TrustRadius, and SourceForge. Offer is $25 per platform (up to $75 total per user). This is our most aggressive review push to date, and weâ€™ll be testing and iterating from here.

- Jenica is helping with follow-up and coordination.
- Expecting to generate momentum with mid-funnel credibility + SEO value across third-party platforms.

---

### **Outbound Email Infrastructure (Eric @ GrowthEngineX)**

Spoke with Eric from GrowthEngineX â€” weâ€™re aiming to run a free test and potentially scale quickly after. Their team can manage deliverability, domains, and inboxes, sending up toÂ **15,000 emails/month**Â for ~$5K/month. Cost scales well if we want to increase volume.

- Plan is to segment by tier:
    - **Tier 1 (Midmarket/Strategic):**Â AE-owned, personalized
    - **Tier 2 (Core Midmarket):**Â SDR touch with AE close
    - **Tier 3 (SMB):**Â Automated email-only coverage
- Goal: wide surface area in construction, wholesale, and materials segments
- This will support Zakiâ€™s call volume and allow us to pause or trim Google Ads if needed

---

### **Conversion Rate Optimization (Octabase)**

Octabase is currently running 3 experiments across key pages. No conclusions yet â€” but this is mostly toÂ **exercise the muscle**Â and improve conversion ahead of Series A.

- Especially important for organic strategy: the value of SEO traffic will compound if we can reliably convert
- Also supports capital efficiency as we scale GTM inputs

---

### **SEO + Content â€“ Contact Studios + ACH Programmatic Pages**

- Contact Studiosâ€™ first 10 blog posts are due today or tomorrow. Iâ€™ll review and push live shortly after.
- Weâ€™ve finalized design + layout for:
    - The ACH return codeÂ **index page**
    - The individualÂ **programmatic post pages**
- Goal is to get the full set live by end of month.
- We believe this programmatic set could drive up toÂ **10x traffic growth**Â pre-Series A

---

### **New Paid Campaigns + Strategic Shifts**

- **Launched:**Â NKBA (National Kitchen & Bath Association) ad campaign â€” exploring vertical-specific targeting with mid-high intent commercial buyers
- **Scaling down:**Â Free ACH campaign â€” while it worked early, weâ€™re shifting paid budget towardÂ **higher ACV verticals**Â and lead sources

---

### **Google Ads Stabilizing**

- CPA is stabilizing and trending under $400
- Current CPA doesnâ€™t fully account for invalid leads, so effective cost is even lower
- Strong foundation, but may reallocate some spend if outbound performs well

---

### **Landing Page Design â€“ Flowout**

Flowout helped design our most recent programmatic SEO pages. This is part of a broader strategy toÂ **build a bench of design resources**Â we can tap quickly to scale GTM without bottlenecks.

- Helps us stay focused on strategy + optimization rather than execution
- Critical as we scale support for AE and outbound campaigns

---

### **Support for SDR + AE Pairing**

- As we ramp outbound and bring on AE, marketing needs toÂ **expand, not shrink**.
- Everything above (email infra, paid, content, CRO) is designed to make sure GTM stays ahead of AE capacity â€” not the other way around.
