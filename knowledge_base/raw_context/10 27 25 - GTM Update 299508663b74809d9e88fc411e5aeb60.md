## Organic Search

- Overall traffic has been **steady**, but **growth is flattening** on previously strong performers like the **credit card surcharging** and **transfer limit** pages — likely because they’ve reached their top keyword potential.
- Some minor drops on less important content (e.g. **weekend transfer times** article), which had high volume but low conversions.
- **Routing number pages** continue to be indexed. Optimistic, but **it will take a few more weeks** to see meaningful results and big question is quality of conversion.
- Mike (Contact Studios) is leading the **content refresh and optimization effort**, including punch-ups on underperforming pages..
