# Chatbot FAQ Log

Owner: Jenica
Status: Not started

This log compiles visitor conversations from the #website-chatbot channel, with a focus on two areas:

1. **FAQs** — recurring questions or gaps where the bot’s response was weak, overly technical, or unclear. These are being drafted into both **short chatbot answer**s and l**onger help-center entries**.
2. **Requests & Suggestions** — feedback and feature requests surfaced by visitors (e.g., mobile app, QuickBooks syncing expectations, invoice formatting concerns).

The goal is to track not just what visitors are asking, but also the **patterns**: where the bot struggles, what topics repeat, and what product feedback is emerging. This will help us improve both the chatbot experience and the knowledge base, while also feeding insights back to product and engineering.
