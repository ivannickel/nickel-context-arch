## **3. Fun Time**

### **Appendix - Hubspot AI Analysis of Deals This Week**

### **Most Frequently Requested ‚ÄúNon-Current‚Äù Features**

### **Volume & Prevalence (Relative, Based on All Deals)**

- **QuickBooks Desktop**: ~12‚Äì18% of all opportunities mention this as a need or blocker.
- **Xero**: ~4‚Äì7%
- **API Access**: ~2‚Äì4%
- **Split Disbursement**: 1‚Äì2% (niche, but when it comes up it‚Äôs highly prioritized).
- **International Payments**: 2‚Äì5%
- **Other ERP/Niche Integrations**: 1‚Äì3%

### **Patterns**

- There is a strong correlation between deal value/size and request for integrations beyond QuickBooks Online (Desktop, Xero, API, etc.).
- Many of these features are the only blocker to closing ‚Äútop‚Äù deals otherwise excited about Nickel‚Äôs standard feature set (free ACH, QBO integration).

**1. QuickBooks Desktop Integration**

- This is the single most consistently surfaced non-supported ask.
- Many deals mention friction with migrating from QuickBooks Desktop to Online, or outright state they cannot migrate and need Desktop support.
- Desktop customers often cite fee escalation, product retirement concerns, or integration gaps as reasons for considering Nickel.

**2. Xero Integration**

- Several deals (particularly those with accounting or finance-forward buyers) explicitly request support for Xero, either as a requirement or a barrier to adoption.
- Xero is most frequently mentioned where the client is non-US, or has accounting workflows standardized globally.

**3. API Access & Embedded Functionality**

- A smaller, but technically savvy subset of prospects (especially SaaS/fintech and large property managers) ask for API access to:
    - Automate payouts
    - Embed payments within another app
    - Support custom or deeply integrated workflows

**4. Split Disbursement / Multi-EIN / Multi-Entity Support**

- A few accounts, often in professional services or real estate, have asked for the ability to split a single payment across multiple bank accounts/EINs.
- These are rare, ‚Äòpower user‚Äô requests but have high value when present.

**5. International Payments**

- Multiple deals mention the need to send or receive payments cross-border, either because their clients are international, or because of plans to expand globally.
- U.S. bank account requirement or no global ACH is a documented blocker.

**6. Advanced ERPs/Other Integrations**

- A small but important segment voices interest in integrations with:
    - Other accounting/ERP platforms (Sage, Netsuite, Epicor, etc.)
    - Niche vertical software

**7. Cash Flow Lending/Banking-as-a-Service**

- Occasionally surfaced as an adjacent or future interest (ie., lending, underwriting, operating lines, etc.), though not as often as integration/automation asks.
