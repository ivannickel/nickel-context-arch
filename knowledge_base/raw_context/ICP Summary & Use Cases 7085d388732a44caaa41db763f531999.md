# ICP Definition

ICP is always a moving target for an early stage startup. The following definitions are based on our current learnings and the patterns we see from existing customers

But our North Star is our Leading Indicator of Retention: `Acquired customer receives *50% of monthly receivables* on Nickel‚Äôs platform`

We will continue to update, change, add/remove ICPs based on customer cohorts that exceed our LIRR.

| **4. Real Customer Examples** | [Chicago Brass](https://divinedesigncenter.com/)
3rd generation business owners and the current iteration of the business has existed for 30 years. The business is a well-oiled machine with sustainable, repeat business. Even though the owners are young (40s), their goal is to operate the business more smoothly and reduce their own manual work. There are not plans to grow the business or make drastic changes | [Divine Design Center](https://divinedesigncenter.com/)
Founded by first generation immigrant husband & wife team. Wife is a well known designer and husband was a former IT-executive. Very saavy business owners who have built Divine into a recognized leader in Boston in less than 10 years. The owners want to continue growing the business and potentially leave it to their kids in the future.  | [UFP SiteBuilt](https://ufpsitebuilt.com/)
Direct to contractor arm of a F500 engineered lumber (specialty) manufacturer. Executive team is very ambitious and wants to both grow and modernize the business to become a market leader, and has even invested in an in-house software engineering team. But the business is 100+ years old and payments/credit is managed entirely manually by a team |
