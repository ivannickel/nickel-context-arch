# 6/10/25 - GTM Update

Area: 🤑 Revenue
Owner: Ivan LaBianca
Series: Weekly GTM Update
Status: Published
Type: Update

### 1. **CRM + Sales Process (HubSpot Setup)**

- Highest priority now is defining deal stages and lifecycle statuses (MQL, SQL, opportunity, closed-won, etc.)
- Need clear triage and follow-up process for inbound form fills and potential outbound responses
- Exploring whether to call inbound users who haven’t converted (e.g. signed up but didn’t activate)

---

### 2. **Growth Engine X Launch**

- Launching this week with 3K emails/day across multiple campaign variants (verticals and personalization styles)
- Testing three angles; goal is to identify strongest-performing ICP channel
- High upside as potential core outbound engine

---

### 3. **Programmatic SEO — ACH Return Codes + Location Pages**

- 85 return code pages in progress; 15 already live and indexed
- Some are picking up Google Gemini and snippet traffic
- Expect early results now, more meaningful impact by September/October
- Drafting location pages now—goal is fast implementation via Contact Studios
- Also ranking for “how to lower Stripe fees” and “pay vendors via ACH” (editorial content from Contact Studios is picking up traffic)

---

### 4. **New Programmatic Silo — Invoicing for Trades**

- Identified high-volume queries (e.g., “invoicing for plumbers” at 1K+/mo)
- Plan is to launch templates and content around invoicing for contractors and trades
- Will prioritize after location pages with Contact Studios

---

### 5. **Paid Ads (Google/FB)**

- Still cost-effective but underutilized (spend less than 50% of budget in past 2 weeks)
- Adjustments made, but some slowdown in traffic is likely attributable to the lag
- Back on track but will need active monitoring and continued iteration

---

### 6. **SDR Ramp (Colton)**

- Commission-only model
- Has already done prep and has a personal lead list
- Meeting today to align on next steps and HubSpot usage

---

### 7. **Referral + Influencer Activation**

- Recommending we pause efforts to fully build the “first-mover” referral system for now
- Instead, Miguel to reach out to potential influencers directly using existing assets
- Focus is light activation + goodwill promos, with optional paid incentives if needed

---

### 8. **Lightweight Social Media Activity**

- Jennica and Miguel coordinating reposting strategy
- Goal is light brand reinforcement and increased web footprint (support for Google knowledge panel, brand trust)
- Minimal lift; acts as signal amplifier rather than traffic channel
