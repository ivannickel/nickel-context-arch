### 1. 🎥 BizOps Overall Metrics (Miguel)

**📈 August Performance Highlights**

![Screenshot 2025-08-29 at 11.33.53 AM.png](08%2029%2025%20-%20GTM%20Build%20Update/Screenshot_2025-08-29_at_11.33.53_AM.png)

- **TPV Just Short of Record**: Overall TPV reached **$35.2M** — just short of July's $36M record *(could do it by Sunday)*, but **TPV without CJ Brothers actually increased +4.98%** to **$26.2M**, showing our core business remained strong.
    - In fact, the drop in overall AP TPV could be just attributed to CJ Brothers since, without them, AP did increase slightly.
- **Strategic Product Excellence**:
    - **AR Leadership**: Overall AR now represents **36.7%** of total TPV, while **core customers hit 49.3%** — nearly half of all core customer volume is now AR.
    - **Credit Card Momentum**: Overall adoption at **13.6%**, but **core customers usage keeps increasing at 18.2%**
- **Transaction Growth & September Setup**:
    - **Everything grew**: AR transactions in particular at a reasonable rate (+16.92% overall, +16.11% core customers)
    - **AP transaction growth slowed** (+0.64% overall, +1.40% core customers) — which is in line with what we know about AP activation, so in September this will be a focus for Ray/product to see if something's wrong with that flow and perhaps with Colton use this as a list to target
    - **August acknowledged as a 'slower' month** — most metrics still growing but at more moderate rates
    - **September should be a big month**: With Ray returning and Colton transitioning to CSM, we have the focus to capitalize on our strong strategic foundation

### 1. 📧 **Free Emails (Support Team)**

- **Status:** Free emails are BACK and support is open to them again
- **Need:** Support where possible (Colton/Miguel jumping in for the short-term,  improving Fin AI in the long-term)
    - SOP related to Intercom

### 2. 📊 **CSAT & G2 Reviews (Marketing/CX)**

- **CSAT:** We now have a CSAT score that we can use externally - most people quite pleased

![image.png](08%2029%2025%20-%20GTM%20Build%20Update/image.png)

- **G2 Success:** 6 new reviews out of 100 emails sent (6% response rate)
- **Result:** Pushed us to "Highest Performer" and "Easiest to Use" on G2 (thanks Ivan for pointing this out)

- **Next:** Can expect more as we slowly roll this out

### [3. 📝 **Single Form (Ray)**](https://www.getnickel.com/book-a-call)

- **Status:** Now officially live
- **Improvements:** Ray made it look better and embedded calendar to increase conversion
- **Usage:** So far, people seem to be using it properly

### 4. 🎯 [**Lead Qualification System / CSM & AE Division of Labor (Colton + Operations)**](https://www.figma.com/board/NmEMuXPMe8geJrGq9xgGKs/Customer-Journey-Mapping?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=Exn9XWG5uJIwyShs-0)

- **New Structure:** Every signup qualified as Shrimp, Fish, Whale by "Filipino intelligence"
- **Routing Logic:**
    - Shrimps: Drip campaign with no call booking option
    - Fish: Call option but less priority/touch
    - Whales: High touch and priority
- **Benefits:** Helps Google Ads + ensures high priority signups called ASAP (example - Champion Legacy Resources)
    - Were 16 Fish and Above this week so should be manageable to start
- **Flow:** No engagement → CSMs/activation → AEs 7-day non-activated workflow

### 5. 📬 **Email Workflows (Miguel)**

- **Next Week:** Finalize transition from customer.io to HubSpot for these drip campaigns with a target for next Tuesday
- **Status:** Ready to switch for Day 1-7 period, will work with AEs for what makes sense post Day 7 longer period
    - Benefit of using Hubspot is we can tie it to certain stages like they’ve linked a bank account, haven’t made transaction in a while etc.

### 6. 📊 Marketing Updates

### 1. SEO & AI-Search Traction

- **ACH Content is Driving Volume**
    - We've published **48 pages** targeting ACH transfer limits by bank.
    - These pages generated **150+ clicks from Google last week alone** — and that's just what we can attribute directly.
    - Many more visitors are landing via **direct traffic and LLMs** (e.g., ChatGPT), where Nickel is being **increasingly cited** in answers around ACH transfers and limits.
- We're not yet being **recommended consistently** for **large-transaction or high-value use cases**, but we expect to see **ranking improvements over time** as citation frequency, backlinks, and branded search volume compound.

---

### 2. Off-Site Mentions & Strategic Backlinks

This is a **high-moat, high-leverage** channel

- **Organic Mentions → Real Traffic**
    - We've seen firsthand that a **single Facebook group post** or offhand **Reddit mention** can spike qualified traffic.
    - Our strongest growth loops are **organic word-of-mouth combined with AI search** — low cost, hard to replicate, and increasingly defensible.
- **SOP for Off-Site Advocacy**
    
    We need to **standardize having conversations around this**:
    
    - In CS, sales, and onboarding calls: **“Would you be open to recommending us anywhere? Are you in any industry groups that might benefit from Nickel?”**
    - Many users **don’t care about affiliate links**, but are happy to write reviews or plug us on niche forums.
- **Referral + Badge Program**
    - Build a lightweight **badge/backlink program**, especially targeting:
    - Accountants and bookkeepers
    - SMBs with “QuickBooks Certified” or “Stripe Partner” type badges on their websites
        - Send outreach campaigns encouraging them to add a **“Proud Nickel User” badge** with a backlink — improves SEO and social proof.

---

### 3. LLM Citation Tracking + Triage System

- **LLM Tracking & Infrastructure**
    - Plan to implement an **LLM citation monitoring tool**.
    - This will help us understand **which articles are being cited**, how often, and **optimize for continued inclusion** in GPT-4/5, Claude, Perplexity, etc.
- **High-Fidelity Lead Triage (Clay + ZoomInfo)**
    - In development: a comprehensive triage pipeline to enrich every inbound account with:
    - Revenue estimates
    - Employee count
    - Website scrape
    - Google search and badge detection
        - Stack will likely include **ZoomInfo, Clay, Clearbit**, and backup layers for fallback.

---

### 4. PR, Press, and Credibility Loops

- **Time to Go Loud**
    - We’re overdue for PR and third-party validation.
    - Recommend starting with:
    - A **case study press release** (e.g. “$12M in Vendor Payments Processed for Distributors with Nickel”)
    - Targeting **Fintech and B2B trade publications**, leveraging stories around free ACH and fraud protection.
    - Building a **bank of customer quotes** and narratives to reuse across G2, LLM content, and social proof assets.
    
    **LinkedIn**
    
    ### 5. Chatbot Wins & Real-Time Conversion
    
    Front-End Chat → Revenue
    
    - Our website chatbot is driving real conversions — **Crazy Candy Fun** being a standout win.
    - Key insight: many visitors **convert or bounce within 60 seconds** based on whether their question is answered.
    - This underscores the value of instant-response infrastructure. Real-time matters.
    
    FAQ Content Loop
    
    - We’re compiling unanswered questions to build a **live FAQ page**, which will:
    - Improve chatbot accuracy
    - Capture SEO from long-tail queries
    - Serve as a fast, human-readable help layer
- Default to White Glove if possible
    - As Jacob will note later, even seemingly small leads can convert later or mask real size.
    - In my view, at our stage we should still treat **every lead like it could be an enterprise as much as possible**, unless clearly fraud.
    - At the rate we are scaling, if we are feeling strain realtime, we are already behind
    - Conversations with small customers are equally valuable for identifying bugs/marketing messaging challenges, etc
    - Suggest hiring Jenica to support in triage process

### 7. 🤑 Sales Updates

1. **New Slack Channel!** 
    - #Sales-Deals
    - Channel will auto-update when an AE controlled deal is moved to Signed-Up or Activated

- **Zak shoutout !**
    - Since our last GTM Sync, Zak’s had 3 great ICP fit meetings booked.
    - Highlight: **Associated General Contractors of Greater Milwaukee** Director of Operations. Associated group of 250 contractors/businesses.
    - Reminder: last week, Zak’s talk track was so good the guy literally “booked himself” and asked to invite the CEO and COO to the call.
- **$86,426,000 of accumulative Company Revenue across 27 new accounts in AE Controlled Deals Closed Won Stage Deals in August!**
    - **Unique Highlights:**
        - **Voronyx ($1.3m) & SouthEastern Technical ($5.2m)**
            - **7 day non activated forms.**
                - However, neither company was the original sign-up or “non-activated” account. Both had representatives within or affiliations with smaller businesses that signed up for free, never activated. After engagement, we were able to open opps with new accounts.
        - **Crazy Candy Fun**
            - $25M revenue. Chatbot!! Explored us and planned on exploring Melio, demo follow up email prevented them from every taking a demo with Melio.
        - **Robert M. Hidey Architects**
            - $10M revenue. **Robert M. Hidey Architects - New Deal**

### 9. 🔜 Next Week

### 👥 **Colton Capacity & CSM Structure**

- Trial Colton's capacity since he'll be really busy, and adjust from there
- We have a good sense of what the plan is for new signups but will continue working with Colton to figure out best way to target already active users using data we have (e.g., CC usage, AP usage etc.)
**Next:** Work on Tier 1, 2, 3 customer treatment system
    - **Customer segmentation (not replacing qualification tier field)**
    Tier 1 - Non-ICP Whales and any ICP
    Tier 2 - Non-ICP fish
    Tier 3 - Non-ICP shrimp
    - **Potential change in the future depending on bandwidth**
    Tier 1 - Non ICP Whales and ICP fish/whale
    Tier 2 - Non ICP fish, ICP shrimp
    Tier 3 - Non-ICP shrimp
- Primarily working off HS lists:
    - CS / PLG Fish + Whale
    - AP Only Companies
    - High CC Companies
- HubSpot Customer Success user seat and trial
- Introduction to existing Tier 1 customers
- Create an ROI template with sales for EBR to reinforce value
- Customer Success one-pager

### 📋 **Customer Feedback System (Ray, Claudio)**

- **Priority:** Starting to systematize customer/product feedback
- **Current:** Tried V0.5 integrating with Circleback demos (AEs + Colton) uploading to Notion but wasn’t the best AI prompt moving forward
- **Transcripts into Hubspot** instead of Recording
- **Discussion:** Best approach/system moving forward? **AskElephant** as new solution

### 📈 **Customer Stickiness Analysis (AEs)**

- **Project:** Work with AEs to figure out customer stickiness metrics
    - Have a lot of data in Hubspot that we can use and start tracking how much their deals are making and quite granularly (AR, AP)
