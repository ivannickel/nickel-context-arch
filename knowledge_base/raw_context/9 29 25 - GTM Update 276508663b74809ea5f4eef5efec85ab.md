## **Approvals & Growth**

- 15 accounts approved as of today.
- CrossedÂ **2,000 organic clicks this week**Â (highest ever, per Google Search Console).

## **SEO / Content**

- **Industry pages launched (15 total):**Â roofers, concrete contractors, framers, insulation contractors, electricians, plumbers, and others.
- Waiting on Fran to:
    - Build the industry index page
    - Push feature pages + About page (backlog once heâ€™s back in office)
    - PublishÂ **bank routing number template pages**Â (template is ready; another major silo).
- Case studies: Colton + Miguel are building industry-aligned case studies to publish on these pages. Goal = reduce duplicate content risk and increase page value/uniqueness against algorithm updates.

## **Outbound Email (Growth Engine X)**

- 15 leads generated so far.
- 4 opportunities have progressed toÂ **meeting stage**.

## **Advertising / Retargeting**

- Set up cookies withÂ **Vibe Connected TV**Â (reach = 140M US audience).
    - Already captured ~4,000 site visitors into retargeting pool.
- Next step: high-quality content asset.
    - ContactedÂ **Vidico** Â â€” proposal ready for review.
    - Vidico clients include Brex, Airwallex, TikTok; pricing is reasonable.
    - Goal = professional bottom-of-funnel explainer/animated video with multiple hooks (Hook10 variations).
    - Distribution = Connected TV + YouTube. Primary objective is to boostÂ **trust + credibility**.

## **Google Ads**

- Improving performance, reflected in sign-ups today.

## **Support / Lead Quality**

- Managing support firsthand â€” observing that lead quality and tracking are tricky.
- **Fraud accounts:**
    - Large volume creates risk; currently cautious about outreach.
    - Need to auto-deny fraud-risk accounts faster and feed that back into ad algorithm.
    - Long-term: explore aÂ **safe motion to engage these leads**Â (possibly SDR outreach to borderline cases). Could be high-value if executed carefully.

## **Social / Experiments**

- **Nilah social campaign**: ready to launch pending contract. Sheâ€™ll run in-person sales and document the process. Small experiment but potentially high-leverage.
