# 4/28/25 - GTM Update

Area: 🤑 Revenue
Owner: Ivan LaBianca
Series: Weekly GTM Update
Status: Published
Type: Update

## Outbound Sales

- Met with Zaki to get backround on previous outbound process
- Key insights
    - Used **Nooks** to dial up to **2,000 prospects/day** using parallel dialing.
    - **Lead Volume**: Zaki will require a large, well-organized pipeline — this includes sourcing numbers, enriching records, and managing delivery pace.
    - Key tools being deployed:
        - **Dialer**: Nooks (parallel dialing, 700–2,000 dials/day). Demo completed, purchase in progress.
        - **Lead Sourcing**: Apollo.io and Clay for enrichment.
        - **Manual CSV Pipeline**: Leads will initially be manually uploaded into Nooks. Long-term, we may move to API integration, but human selection of leads will remain critical to maintain quality.
    - Bringing on **Jenica**, an experienced lead generation VA, to support:
        - Organizing TAM (Total Addressable Market).
        - Sourcing, enriching, and uploading large volumes of leads.
        - Managing outbound number hygiene and refreshing caller IDs.
    - Initial lead workflow will be heavily manual to maintain flexibility and quality as we build but can be moved to API down the road
- **VA Support**: Bringing on **Jenica**, a lead generation VA I’ve worked with before, to help:
    - Map the total addressable market (TAM)
    - Source and enrich leads
    - Manage manual CSV uploads and phone number rotation
- If successful, outbound could later be synced with **paid ad targeting and email** for broader TAM coverage. But priority now is getting the infrastructure right to avoid waste or burnout.

## SEO & Content: Early Execution with Contact Studios

- Selected **Contact Studios** as our content partner.
- They’re committed to publishing **200 posts over the next two months**, with delivery starting in the next 2–3 weeks.
- Posts will be pushed **directly to Webflow.**
- I’ll be closely involved in strategy and QA to ensure output aligns with brand and performance goals.
- Their content will target:
    - Traditional SEO terms
    - **AI-driven search platforms** like Perplexity, ChatGPT, and Google SGE
- Early signs are positive for SEO as a channel:
    - We’re now **ranking #2 for “Free ACH payments”**
    - Already saw several **organic leads come in** through that post
- Still early days — we’re not scaled, but foundation is being laid for this to become a core channel.

## Conversion Rate Optimization: Lightweight Test Planning

- Met with the founder of **OptaBase and Flowout** a Ukraine-based CRO team with Webflow experience.
- They offer a **low-cost test package**: 5 hours of CRO work for $269 + $39/month software.
- Plan is to run basic experiments on high-traffic pages:
    - Pricing page
    - Signup flow
    - Potential CTA tests for incentive offers
- This isn’t a priority channel yet, but we’re seeing enough traffic to justify running a few tests.
- OptaBase also offers Webflow design services (~$100/hr), which could help if we want to spin up landing pages faster.
- Overall: this is a **small bet**, but a worthwhile one. If even minor improvements lift conversion rates, it will pay for itself — and we’ll have infrastructure in place for later scale.

## Summary

- **Outbound**: We’re in planning mode — building the lead infrastructure and vetting tooling. This will be a big channel if done right, but it’s not plug-and-play.
- **Content**: Execution starting now. We’ve seen early results, and if quality holds, this can become our most cost-efficient source of inbound leads.
- **CRO**: Early tests planned, low effort/high leverage. Not a growth lever yet, but worth investing in infrastructure.

## Priorities This Week

- Complete Nooks demo and evaluate options.
- Finalize processes with Jenica and Zaki begin outbound motion.
- Coordinate closely with Contact Studios as they start writing.
- Scope initial CRO tests and decide whether to activate the OptaBase starter package.
- Monitor organic lead flow and keyword rankings as content starts to scale.
