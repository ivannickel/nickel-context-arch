### Google Ads Performance & Optimization

- We've now logged 37 total approved conversions from Google Ads.
- In the last 30 days (since we raised the budget), we've had 34 approved conversions at a total cost of $21.5k ‚Äî averaging ~$632 per approved lead.
- Campaign breakdown (Feb 25‚ÄìMar 25):
    - Free ACH: $848 per approved lead
    - Melio: $329 per lead
    - Branded search: $514 per lead
- Shorter timeframe (Feb 24‚ÄìMar 17) showed slightly better performance: Free ACH at $630, Melio at $336.
- While current numbers are improving, we may not hit our target CPA of $200‚Äì$250 without changes to targeting or channel mix.
- Attribution remains a challenge. Some leads that might be influenced by Google Ads (e.g., branded/direct) are not fully accounted for due to tracking limitations.

### Conversion Tracking & Attribution (Attio)

- Posthog and Fillout data has been piped into Attio.
- Still unclear whether Attio can support fully accurate source attribution. Worth reviewing our long-term plan for attribution visibility across the funnel.
- Ideally, we want full-funnel view (from source ‚Üí signup ‚Üí approval ‚Üí activation).

### Facebook Ads & Meta Flagging

- Retargeting ads are live with a $50/day cap ‚Äî it's not spending the full budget.
- No direct conversions yet, but likely building brand familiarity via mobile impressions.
- Meta has flagged our account under ‚ÄúFinancial Products & Services,‚Äù restricting audience targeting (no lookalikes, job titles, etc.).
- Discovered this category was introduced in Oct 2023 ‚Äî previously unknown.
- Learned via Facebook Ads Library that **Melio is not flagged** despite offering similar services ‚Äî this insight allowed escalation.
- Spoke with **three Meta reps** (technical, creative, marketing) ‚Äî one rep is now helping us work toward a resolution.
- Getting unflagged would be a major unlock for scalable Facebook performance marketing.
- Without conversion tracking, Facebook optimizes for low-value traffic (e.g., toddlers clicking reels). Reiterating how important it is to solve this.

### G2 Ads & Organic Optimization

- G2 ad performance so far:
    - 21 clicks ‚Üí only one (low-quality) form fill
    - $518 spent
- Most traffic came from Melio and QuickBooks comparison pages.
- Recommending we **pause pay-per-click** on G2 and instead test the **$999/month Core plan** ‚Äî allows sign-up links, improved visibility, and better data (e.g., profile views).
- G2 review campaign has gone well: **40+ live reviews**. We can continue momentum with incentives and automation via [Customer.io](http://customer.io/).
- Suggest defaulting to Amazon gift cards going forward for easier fulfillment.

### SEO, Content, and Organic Strategy

- Published 3 new blog posts: topics around ACH vs. wire transfers, credit cards, and ACH processing times.
- Deep SEO audit took site score from **35 to 86** on Ahrefs ‚Äî significant upgrade in technical SEO health.
- Using Deep Research + Claude 3.5 + [Originality.ai](http://originality.ai/) to create well-sourced, high-quality blog posts.
- Focused on building **topic authority clusters** (e.g., ACH), with internal linking and strategic keyword targeting.
- Explored AirOps for faster content generation but found it low quality, especially when using cheaper LLMs.
- Evaluating two agency options:
    - Content Distribution (met with already; not recommended)
    - One high-end agency with promising proposal ‚Äî meeting this week
- Could also scale internal content with a trained virtual assistant for ~$100‚Äì150/post. Training would be needed but results could match agency quality.
- Backlink strategy and guest posting are also being explored.
- Exploring programmatic SEO (Daydream) and AI Search optimization for platforms like Perplexity and ChatGPT.

### Additional Opportunities

- Exploring potential lower-bar conversion point (email collection for those who don‚Äôt connect their bank).
- Began building out customer journey doc; not quite ready to share yet.
- Suggested goal-tracking framework for organic traffic: e.g., 250 ‚Üí 500 ‚Üí 1000 search visits/week.
- Investigating Microsoft/Bing Ads as a potential high-ROI channel given the older B2B audience.
- Also suggested:
    - Competitor search campaigns (e.g., against QuickBooks or Global Payments)
    - YouTube retargeting
    - Video ads for short-form platforms
