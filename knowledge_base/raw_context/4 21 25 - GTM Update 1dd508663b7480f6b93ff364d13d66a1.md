# 4/21/25 - GTM Update

Area: 🤑 Revenue
Owner: Ivan LaBianca
Series: Weekly GTM Update
Status: Published
Type: Update

### Google Ads

- Campaign performance was still being impacted this week due to conversion tracking going offline briefly last week This caused Google to kick the campaign into learning mode and stop spending on several days.
- The root issue was related to a strict target ROAS setting that became too aggressive once Google stopped seeing conversions. I’ve since corrected this and made adjustments to avoid recurrence.
- While trouble shooting, I also took the chance to optimize ad copy based on data collected the last 60 days.
- Launched a new campaign targeting **QuickBooks Payments** and “QuickBooks alternative” keywords — early impressions are good, but we should discuss:
    - *What % of QuickBooks users do we believe are a fit for Nickel?*
    - *Should we target Quickbooks bill pay, and the brand name directly?*

### Organic Search

- Organic traffic dropped slightly this week, returning to the level we saw two weeks ago.
    - This appears to be driven mostly by a decline in **branded search volume**.
    - Our branded campaign picked up more clicks this week at a lower cost (~$150 per approved lead).
    - I recommend keeping the branded campaign live — it’s inexpensive and helps us defend our brand against competitors bidding on our name (e.g. Melio).
- Most content-driven posts still saw traffic gains, even as branded volume dipped.
    - A few specific posts (e.g. “Will your money send on Saturday?”) declined, but nothing unexpected.
- Blog content continues to drive signups and impact AI search visibility. See Example below:

### Webflow Landing Pages

- Launched new landing pages for:
    - **QuickBooks Payments Alternative**
    - **Square ACH Alternative**
- Drafted a list of LP’s to build next, see here: [https://www.notion.so/nickelhq/1dc508663b7480e3bd7fead3a8498c04?v=1dc508663b74815d9059000cf8b4a00b](https://www.notion.so/1dc508663b7480e3bd7fead3a8498c04?pvs=21)
- Suggest— next up should be **Bill.com Alternative**, followed by **Plastiq Alternative, then industry specific pages**
- These landing pages are not just useful for search — they’re designed to increase AI surface area and long-tail relevance

### Referral Program & Influencer Outreach

- Finalized terms and conditions for the referral program
- To discuss - how to connect to existing program?
- Influencer/blogger outreach will begin this week now that terms are settled.
- I’d like to propose a few additional things for discussion:
    - Would it make sense to offer a **first-transaction incentive** (e.g. $50 or $100 credited after using Nickel)? This could be A/B tested to determine the lift in conversion
    - Do we have a streamlined way to deliver incentive payments like this (outside of First Promoter)?

### Conversion Flow & Infrastructure

- We’re now optimizing campaigns more directly for **signups** rather than intermediate steps.
- Important point: if something breaks in the signup flow, it could immediately kick campaigns back into learning mode — resulting in spend drops.
    - Given the size of our ad budget, I’d like to flag this risk and discuss whether there’s anything in the signup flow that’s fragile or due for refactoring
