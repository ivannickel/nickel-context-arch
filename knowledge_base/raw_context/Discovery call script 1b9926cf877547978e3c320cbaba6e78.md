## Step 1 - Opening & Setting the agenda

- It looks like you live in `CITY`, how long have you lived there?
- If inbound: how did you hear about us?
- Thanks again for taking some time today to meet with me today. Iâ€™d like to spend this time better understanding your goals and challenges with payments, as well as what youâ€™re looking for in a partner
- If it looks like a potential fit, then we can schedule a demo, does that work?

## Step 2 - Understanding the current situation & challenges

- Before we start talking about payments, Iâ€™d love to learn a little more about the history of the business and your biggest priorities
- Who are your customers, and what construction projects do they work on?
- How are you extending net terms and collecting payments today?

## Step 3 - Consideration / Decision

- Have you tried or looked into any other partners before?
- What features or criteria have you defined as a must-have and why?
- Imagine weâ€™re in a perfect world, and you have all these tools at your disposal. What would success look like?
- Besides you, who else from your team will be using this product and should be looped in as you evaluate a solution?
