    - Manually call the business to confirm before we approve the account (optional, high value accounts)

AP:

- Require Plaid for all payment method â†’ Same as no plaid registration
- Check balance on every AP payment
- Ensure a valid email on the recipient

AR:

- If payout bank account balance is not 2-3x greater than incoming payment, then slow down payout.
- If incoming payment is more than $X dollars, then require plaid for ACH
