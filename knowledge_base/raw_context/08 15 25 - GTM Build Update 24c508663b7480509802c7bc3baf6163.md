1. **Free Emails** (Recap of what's been implemented, Why we made the change and What we're expecting to see change)
2. **Activation Observations** (This one is more ongoing and so I'm recapping the insights but it's not a quick fix so open to some quick ideas to tackle)

6. **Next Steps**

### 1. üì£ Free Email Registration Changes

- **Observation** - Total signups have increased but this has been primarily driven by free signups, which for the most part, have not been moving the needle on our overall business. We‚Äôve also seen customers  using personal emails to sign up when they have a business email.
- **Problem** - This has both clogged support and resulted in activation challenges
- **Change** - **Cannot** sign up on the platform anymore, keep on for 2 weeks
- **Change** - Migrating Google conversion tracking to HubSpot to allow us to send data earlier and post sales (optimize for fish and whales)

| [**Dashboard**](https://app.popsql.com/dashboards/1Ba5mGBw) | **Pre-Aug 13** | **Aug 25 (Actual)** | **% Change** | **Aug 27 (Goals)** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Total Signups (Last 30 Days) | 782 | 682 | -12.79% | 700 |
| Business Signups | 400 | 415 | 3.75% | 450 |
| # of Activated Customers (1 txn) | 160 | 138 | -13.75% | 176 |
| # of Activated Business Signups (1txn) | 122 | 110 | -9.84% |  |
| Overall Activated Customers % | 20.46% | 20.23 | -1.12% | 22.5% |
| Overall Approval Rate % | 26.21% | 23.75% | -10.49% | 28% |
|  |  |  |  |  |

### 2. Activation Observations & Data Deep Dive

**Data Problems - Key Gaps Identified:**

- Big gap between sign up and onboarding (only 50% complete onboarding)
- **More critical gap:** Onboarding to 1st transaction which is what we actually want to see (35.7%)
- We want black and blue line (to mirror the orange and yellow line)

[**Funnel Observations**](https://app.popsql.com/dashboards/1Ba5mGBw)

|  | **Today** | **Aug 27** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Total Signups (Last 30 Days) | 769 |  |
| Fully Onboarded (Bank + SSN) | 426 |  |
| Signups to Onboarded % | 55.4 |  |
| 1 txn | 152 |  |
| Onboarded to 1 Txn | 35.7% |  |
|  |  |  |

**Sales Team Anecdotal Problems**

- When customers called from pending list, many don't remember that they've signed up
- Indicates that signup could be **too quick** that it doesn‚Äôt leave a lasting impression

### Longer-Term Change Proposals

- **Quick Changes**
    - Business Emails only should lower total signups while everytime modal should raise onboarding % to close gap
    - Revamp activation email sequence (opportunity to move from customer.io)
- **Long-Term Key Positioning Shift:** Position Nickel as a **premium B2B solution** (vs the 'free ACH' tool messaging)
    - **The Jacob Greenberg:** ‚ÄúUnderstand ACH is free not because it‚Äôs a cheaper platform, but because Nickel works only with verified businesses it knows and has strong relationships with.‚Äù
    - The above is just a thought we had but it could help with:
        - Alleviating support
        - Better signup education process
        - Improving denial process communication
- **AR vs AP**
    - **How to get to 1 transaction - AR**
    - **How to keep continuing - AP**

---

### 3. Marketing Updates

- Shifting conversion tracking over to HubSpot
    - Will allow for better quality data to be sent to google and optimizing for large accounts
- Launching new round of A/B testing on top landing pages
- Published first 5 ACH limit pages
    - Sofi and BOA pages already generating traffic

### 4. ü§ë¬†Sales Updates

- Pipeline/Forecast
    - $70M in Revenue between Commit (90% likelihood closing) and Upside (50% likelihood closing)
        - 65% Inbound
        - 35% Outbound
- Outbound for August - **Tracking**
    - new-nickel-users
    - 7 day non-activated list
- Cold outbound on nooks/apollo
    - List Build

### 5. üì£ **Discussion: HubSpot vs Intercom Support Strategy**

**Two Primary Goals:**

1. Alleviate volume of requests (while still offering the support they need)
    1. **Help Questions -** Product/Company Questions that Non-Technical Members can answer
    2. **Support Questions** - Need someone from engineering team to handle (e.g., bug fix etc.)
2. Get visibility across the entire orgization
    - Especially for clients in pipeline (talking to sales team)
    - Important clients who need assistance - 3T

**HubSpot Chatbot Performance & Current State:**

**The Good:**

- Leads using it to book demos (Crazy Candy example)
- Current customers using for support questions

**The Bad:**

- Times where current customer shows as 'unknown visitor' (no way to know who they are and offer support)
- For instance, one today that I fielded where no customer information was available until they sent a PDF invoice

**Proposed Changes - Next Week:**

- Given engineering team's concerns about knowledge base lift, the integrations with the Nickel platform and HubSpot being relatively new
- **Recommendation: Remain with Intercom as primary support option for in-app experience**

**Proposed Changes (Next 2 Weeks):**

1. **HubSpot chatbot remains on website** - test functionality and usage patterns (leads vs current customers)
    - **Potential Downside -** Will the requests become too much to handle?
    - **Mid-Term Goal:**
        - If its more new leads coming in - Just leave Hubspot on
        - If its mostly current customers coming in - Perhaps thinking about an Intercom bot
2. **Workflow Improvements:**
    - In Intercom, the Hubspot contact owner is being passed on (needs to be manually selected for each individual)
        - **Manual Option -** Will tags relevant contact owner (Miguel as fallback option) and decides if its a technical vs non-technical request
        - **Automatic Option**
            - Create workflow for better customer identification
                - In **Intercom**: Create a quick checkbox field for Will to check if its a non-technical request
                - In **Hubspot**: A workflow where if an intercom event is started and its a **non-technical request**, a contact is owned or there is a live deal, then trigger a notification to the relevant AE (or Miguel)
    - **Result:** No more scrolling through support notifications for important accounts and you get tagged
    - **Consideration:** Are sales team expected to field these questions quickly?

**Expected Impact:** We not only help Will with **help** questions BUT we have relevant context for the most important accounts that we've touched
