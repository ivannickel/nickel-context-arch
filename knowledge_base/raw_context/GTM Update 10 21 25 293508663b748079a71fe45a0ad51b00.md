## Organic Search & Site Performance

- **Highest day ever yesterday since stopping Google ads** with 32 total leads and 20 business signups — a strong indicator of resilience without Google Ads.
- Organic traffic dipped slightly over the last 2 weeks but is already rebounding. Friday was our highest organic day to date.
- New programmatic pages are already driving traffic:
    - “Wells Fargo routing number” ranked as the #2 query yesterday.
    - Template is outperforming competitors; optimistic about long-term performance.
    - Next series: 1099 forms and tariff law pages.
- Strategy: Blend of programmatic (ACH return codes, routing numbers, etc.) and high-value editorial content (e.g., QuickBooks, charging guides, vertical landing pages).

## Google Ads: 3 Weeks Paused

- Currently only bidding on branded terms: $1,600 spent for 10 conversions (~$160/lead).
- Brand protection keywords remain best practice and cost-effective.
- Signups dipped slightly in the last two weeks, but organic traffic drop was a confounding variable.
- Yesterday’s 20 business email signups (without ads) signals strong channel resilience.
- Recommendation: Continue branded-only spend, reallocate remaining budget to scalable long-term channels.

- Cost per session:

    - Retargeting: $0.34
- CPMs remain just over $0.01 — extremely efficient brand awareness.
- Branded searches for "Nickel" rose from 163 to **253** in last 28 days — a **55%+ increase**, possibly early signal of TV impact.
- Anecdotal sales feedback being collected via Colton/onboarding.
