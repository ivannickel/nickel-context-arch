## Company Background: [GetNickel.com](http://getnickel.com/)

Nickel ([getnickel.com](http://getnickel.com/)) is a B2B financial services platform providing payment processing and business banking services. **Nickel operates as a third-party processor/fintech company**, not just a user of payment processors.

### Business Model & Revenue Streams

**Core Business**: Third-party payment processing with freemium model

- **Accounts Receivable (AR)**: Organizations paying invoices ‚Üí tracked in `payments` table
- **Accounts Payable (AP)**: Organizations paying bills ‚Üí tracked in `bill_payments` table
- **Freemium platform**: Organizations can sign up for free but must transact to generate revenue

**Revenue Generation**:

- **Credit card processing**: Via Braintree ‚Üí generates `platform_fee_in_cents` revenue
- **ACH processing**: Via bank partner ‚Üí typically free to customers (no platform fees)
- **Plus subscription plan**: Premium tier with monthly/annual billing
- **QuickBooks integration**: Advanced feature for approved customers

### Customer Lifecycle & Definitions

**Key Business States**:

- **Signup**: Entry in `organizations` table
- **Approval**: `organization_infos.approval_status = 'APPROVED'` + enabled payments/payouts
- **Activated Customer**: Organization that made at least 1 successful payment OR bill payment
- **Plus Customer**: `staged_subscriptions.initiated = TRUE` (premium tier)
- **Integrated Customer**: Organization with QuickBooks integration (`quickbooks_company_id`)

**Business Context**:

- Organizations must be approved before they can transact
- Activated customers = organizations with successful payment history
- Data timeframe: February 2023 to present (~2,400 organizations, ~16,000+ successful payments)

## Database Structure & Field Definitions

### Payment Status Field Meanings ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Critical**: `payments.status` values have specific business meanings:

- **`'CREATED'`** = Invoice created but unpaid (normal business state, NOT a processing issue)
- **`'SUCCEEDED'`** = Completed successful payment (use for TPV and revenue analysis)
- **`'PENDING'`** = Payment awaiting processing/approval
- **`'FAILED'`** = Payment processing failed
- **`'REFUNDED'`** = Payment was refunded

**Analysis Implication**: Focus on `status = 'SUCCEEDED'` for revenue metrics. `'CREATED'` represents normal unpaid invoices, not stuck payments.

### Table Structure & Business Logic

**Core Tables**:

- **`organizations`** - Business customer entities (signups)
- **`organization_infos`** - Extended details, approval status, attribution data
- **`users`** - Individual user accounts within organizations
- **`payments`** - **Accounts Receivable (AR)** - customers paying invoices
- **`bill_payments`** - **Accounts Payable (AP)** - customers paying bills
- **`bills` / `invoices`** - Financial documents processed through platform
- **`payment_methods` / `payout_methods`** - Payment infrastructure
- **`staged_subscriptions`** - Plus plan subscription management

**Key Business Rules**:

- AP customers typically use ACH (explains low fee percentage in `bill_payments`)
- AR customers use mix of credit cards and ACH
- Organizations must be approved (`approval_status = 'APPROVED'`) before transacting

### Approval Process Context

**`organization_infos.approval_status` Values**:

- **`'APPROVED'`** - Can transact on platform
- **`'PENDING'`** - Awaiting approval review
- **`'REJECTED'`** - Cannot transact (generally permanent, rare manual overrides possible)

**Business Logic**: Organizations can create payment records while pending, but payments typically remain in `'CREATED'` status until approval.

### Revenue & Fee Structure

**`payments.platform_fee_in_cents`** - Nickel's revenue from transactions:

- **Credit card transactions**: Generate fees (via Braintree processing)
- **ACH transactions**: Typically free to customers (no platform fees)
- **Fee-free payments**: Some transactions may not generate platform fees

**`bill_payments.platform_fee_in_cents`** - Similar structure but AP-focused:

- Lower fee percentage due to ACH prevalence in AP workflows

### Subscription Management

**`staged_subscriptions` Table Fields**:

- **`initiated = TRUE`** - Active Plus plan customer
- **`initiated = FALSE`** - Subscription setup not completed
- **`plan_id`** values:
    - `'plusmonthly'` - Monthly Plus plan
    - `'plusannual'` - Annual Plus plan
    - `'tv72'`, `'cbvw'` - Internal Braintree payment handling (not customer-facing plans)

### Attribution Data Structure

**Location**: `organization_infos.onboarding_info` (JSON field)

**Key Attribution Paths**:

- `onboarding_info #>> '{attributer,drillData,channel}'` - Acquisition channel
- `onboarding_info #>> '{attributer,drillData,drillDown1}'` - Specific source

**Attribution Context**:

- Tracked by [attributer.io](http://attributer.io/) system
- Major channels: Google (paid/organic), Reddit, Facebook, Direct, Bing
- **Note**: Many AI referrals come without attribution data despite traffic volume

**Common Channel-Source Combinations**:

- "Paid search" + "google" - Google Ads traffic (significant spend)
- "Organic search" + "Google" - SEO traffic
- "Other campaigns" + "[chatgpt.com](http://chatgpt.com/)" - AI-driven referrals

## Database Query Methods - CRITICAL ‚ö†Ô∏è

**‚ùå AVOID - This Function Consistently Fails**:
`pd:POSTGRESQL-EXECUTE-CUSTOM-QUERY`

- Returns "0 rows" for SELECT queries even when data exists
- DO NOT USE for data retrieval

**‚úÖ USE - These Functions Work Reliably**:

- **`pd:POSTGRESQL-FIND-ROW-CUSTOM-QUERY`** - Use for ALL SELECT queries including complex ones
- **`pd:POSTGRESQL-FIND-ROW`** - Use for simple lookups by ID
- **`pd:POSTGRESQL-INSERT-ROW / UPDATE-ROW / UPSERT-ROW`** - Use for data modifications

## Key Business Metrics & Calculations

### Customer Lifecycle Metrics

**Activation Definition**: Organization that made at least 1 successful payment (`payments.status = 'SUCCEEDED'`) OR bill payment (`bill_payments.status = 'SUCCEEDED'`)

**Retention Analysis**:

- Base retention on activated customers only (not total signups)
- Exclude `status = 'CREATED'` from retention calculations
- Use monthly cohorts based on first successful transaction

**Revenue Analysis**:

- **Total Payment Volume (TPV)**: Sum of `amount_in_cents` for successful transactions
- **Platform Revenue**: Sum of `platform_fee_in_cents` from successful transactions
- **Combined Revenue**: Include both `payments` and `bill_payments` platform fees

### Cohort Analysis Best Practices

**Cohort Definition**: Month of customer's first successful payment

- Use `MIN(created_at)` from `payments` WHERE `status = 'SUCCEEDED'`
- Include both AR and AP transactions for complete view

**TPV Calculations**:

- Focus on `amount_in_cents` from successful transactions
- Track monthly TPV progression for expansion analysis
- Segment by payment type (credit card vs ACH) when relevant

---

## Data Quality & Edge Cases

### Reliable Data Sources

- Payment transactions (`payments` and `bill_payments`) - comprehensive and accurate
- Organization signup dates - reliable for growth analysis
- Approval workflows - good for conversion funnel analysis

### Data Interpretation Guidelines

**Payment Volume Context**:

- `payments` table: Accounts Receivable transactions
- `bill_payments` table: Accounts Payable transactions (typically larger volume, lower fees)
- Both contribute to platform activity and customer engagement

**Customer Segmentation**:

- Some organizations use both AR and AP features
- Others specialize in one payment type
- Plus customers may have different usage patterns

**Time Zones & Dates**:

- All dates in UTC format
- Use `DATE_TRUNC('month', created_at)` for monthly cohort analysis

---

## Strategic Analysis Framework

### Focus Areas for Analysis

**Customer Lifecycle**:

- Signup ‚Üí Approval ‚Üí Activation funnel
- Time-to-activation patterns
- Revenue expansion post-activation

**Revenue Optimization**:

- AR vs AP revenue contribution
- Credit card vs ACH transaction patterns
- Plus plan adoption and impact

**Channel Performance**:

- Attribution analysis for customer quality
- Paid vs organic acquisition effectiveness
- Untracked traffic estimation and impact

### Sample Query Patterns

**Revenue Analysis**:

```sql
-- Combined platform revenue from both payment types
SELECT SUM(platform_fee_in_cents)/100.0 as total_platform_revenue
FROM (
  SELECT platform_fee_in_cents FROM payments WHERE status = 'SUCCEEDED'
  UNION ALL
  SELECT platform_fee_in_cents FROM bill_payments WHERE status = 'SUCCEEDED'
) combined_fees;

```

**Customer Activation**:

```sql
-- Organizations with successful payment activity
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT organization_id) as activated_customers
FROM (
  SELECT organization_id FROM payments WHERE status = 'SUCCEEDED'
  UNION
  SELECT organization_id FROM bill_payments WHERE status = 'SUCCEEDED'
) active_orgs;

```

## Analysis Approach

**Data-Driven Discovery**: Let the data reveal patterns and trends rather than assuming business performance
**Field-Specific Context**: Use the field definitions above to interpret results accurately
**Business Logic Awareness**: Apply the approval, payment, and customer lifecycle rules when analyzing funnels
**Revenue Focus**: Prioritize `'SUCCEEDED'` transactions for meaningful business analysis

Remember: This is a fintech platform in a hypergrowth phase. Focus on transacting customer behavior and revenue generation patterns for the most meaningful business insights.

# MCP System Setup Instructions

Hey team! We've set up a way for Claude (or any LLM) to act like a data scientist and explore our Postgres database directly using tools. This lets Claude run queries, analyze data, and dig around our database instance autonomously.

**What this does:**

- Gives Claude direct access to our Postgres database through MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools
- Claude can write and execute SQL queries, explore tables, and perform data analysis
- Thanks to Claudio, Najeer, and Will's work, our schema is pretty self-explanatory
- **Important:**¬†Claude lacks business context, so take its interpretations with a grain of salt - but it's great for database exploration

**Setup Instructions:**

1. 1Ô∏è‚É£¬†[**Download Claude Desktop**](https://claude.ai/download)¬†and log in
2. 2Ô∏è‚É£¬†**Add this to your Claude Desktop config file** *([instructions in this link](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user) of how to find config file - Note: copy the below script NOT what‚Äôs in the website link)*
    
    ```jsx
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "pd": {
          "command": "npx",
          "args": [
            "-y",
            "supergateway",
            "--sse",
            "https://mcp.pipedream.net/ea847dd2-52d4-4d40-a1ff-35682fe167e0/postgresql"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    
3. 3Ô∏è‚É£¬†**Install Node.js** (if you don't already have it) - download from [nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org/)
    1. *Note: instructions to confirm if you have it downloaded in [this link](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user)*
4. 4Ô∏è‚É£¬†**Copy the system prompt** *(i.e., [above](https://www.notion.so/Nickel-MCP-System-Prompt-Setup-Instructions-237508663b748011b492cbea3f87bd00?pvs=21))*

This gives Claude context on how to interact with our database and avoids common pitfalls I've already encountered.

**Note:** We'll keep updating the system prompt as we discover more patterns and edge cases. This is a living document that will get better over time.
