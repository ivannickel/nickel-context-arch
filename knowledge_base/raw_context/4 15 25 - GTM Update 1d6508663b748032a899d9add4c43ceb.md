Type: Update

## Organic Search & Content Performance

- We‚Äôre now ranking on **page one** for terms like:
    - ‚Äúfree ACH‚Äù
    - ‚Äúfree ACH payments‚Äù
    - ‚Äúfree ACH transfers‚Äù
- Still showing up near the bottom of the page, but we are getting traffic ‚Äî and it‚Äôs a clear reminder of how different top 3 placement is from just being on the page.
- We‚Äôve gotten there quickly, especially considering there were likely some technical blocks, including a **duplicate live test version** of the site that I removed.
- Improvements like **linking to the homepage**, content updates, and SEO structure changes all seem to be helping.
- Last week was our **highest ever for organic traffic**:
    - 304 organic visits (up from 278 the week before)
    - A lead came through via the **Free ACH Payment Processing for Small Businesses** post, which is an early but solid sign of traction.

## Content Strategy & Daydream

- I‚Äôve been talking with Daydream this past week ‚Äî we‚Äôve been going back and forth in Slack, and they have a decent amount of context already.
- I want content to be a core part of our growth strategy, and I‚Äôm hoping Daydream can be a long-term partner if they‚Äôre the right fit.
- We‚Äôre totally fine with **programmatic or AI-generated content** for long-tail queries. It doesn‚Äôt need to be perfect, and I want them to have the freedom to publish at scale.
- But for **high-value keywords**, I don‚Äôt want to push $10/article content at something where the goal is top-3 ranking ‚Äî it‚Äôs not worth it unless we can actually win the SERP.
- In those cases, I want a **human editorial layer** or review in place.
- They‚Äôve said they do both programmatic and editorial now, so I‚Äôm waiting to see what their proposal looks like and how they approach that balance.
- Positive signs: they‚Äôre working with good companies (including Anthropic) and seem to be thinking about this seriously.

## Referral Program & Influencer Marketing

- I reviewed PartnerStack ‚Äî it feels too enterprise-focused and overpriced for us right now.
- We‚Äôre better off sticking with **First Promoter**.
    - We just need to finish the **API setup**, test it, and then launch.
    - Planning to launch the first promotion this week, targeting **bloggers and YouTubers**.

## Conversion Rate Optimization & Funnel Design

- Started using **Lucky Orange** to analyze site behavior ahead of launching new landing pages.
- Planning to work with Ray to build:
    - A **QuickBooks Payments landing page**
    - Possibly one around [**Bill.com](http://bill.com/) comparisons**
- The **Pricing Page is our third most visited page** last month, even though we‚Äôre not actively promoting it. Worth optimizing.

---

## Referral Flow & Activation Ideas

- Looking into whether we should add a **post-activation flow** that invites users to refer vendors.
- Might also test a **lower-friction custom referral landing page**, especially for high-value customers.
- Thinking about **referral perks** that are only shown to customers we consider high-value.

## Positioning & Network Effects

- The core goal right now is to make Nickel the **most talked about and most respected B2B payments platform** for:
    - Construction, wholesale, distribution
    - Bookkeepers managing payments for SMBs
- One idea I‚Äôm considering is experimenting with **LinkedIn activation**, possibly with Kenneth‚Äôs help.
    - It worked really well for Clay.
    - Could be as simple as reposting content on LinkedIn and promoting to our followers
    - Main goal is to **activate our customers‚Äô customers**, who are more likely to convert and already understand the space.
