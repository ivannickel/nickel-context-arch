# Competitor Profile: Melio

**Threat Level:** HIGH
**Mention Frequency:** 32 of 166 transcripts (19.3%)
**Customer Satisfaction:** DECLINING (was free, now paid - significant resentment)
**Status:** validated

## Overview

Melio is Nickel's second-most-mentioned competitor, appearing in 19.3% of sales call transcripts. Once a beloved "free ACH" solution, Melio followed QuickBooks Online's lead in September 2022-2023 and implemented a 1% ACH fee (or 5 free transactions/month with limitations). This pricing pivot has created significant customer resentment and active churn opportunities, particularly among volume users who went "from paying nothing to hundreds or thousands of dollars per month."

**Strategic Significance:** Melio represents the classic "bait-and-switch" pattern that Nickel was founded to combat. The displacement opportunity is strongest with volume AP users (Melio's primary use case) who are crushed by the 1% fee. Support accessibility issues compound customer frustration.

**Pricing Evolution:**
- **Historical (pre-2023):** Free ACH (unlimited)
- **Current:** 1% ACH fee OR 5 free transactions/month (with limitations)

**Target Customers:** Small to mid-market businesses, accounting firms, bookkeepers

**Key Features:**
- AP bill pay (primary use case in transcripts)

**Satisfaction Assessment:** Melio's customer satisfaction has **DECLINED SHARPLY** since their pricing pivot in September 2022-2023. While the product still functions and integrates well with QuickBooks, customers resent the broken promise of "free ACH." The 1% fee is particularly devastating for volume users ("hundreds or thousands of dollars per month"). Support accessibility issues compound frustration. Bookkeeper/accountant lock-in creates inertia, but customers are open to switching when presented with alternatives.

## Win/Loss Patterns

### When Nickel Wins Against Melio

**1. Volume AP Users Crushed by 1% Fee (PRIMARY WIN PATTERN)**
- **Pattern:** Customers doing significant payment volume ($50k+/month) where 1% fee = hundreds/thousands per month
- **Evidence:** Transcript 008_hardy-butler_2025-07-23
  - Quote: "customers went from paying nothing to hundreds or thousands of dollars"
  - Context: Accounting firm with 150 clients, processing payments for multiple entities
  - Calculation: Even $50k/month = $500/month Melio fee ($6k/year) vs $420/year Nickel (93% savings)
- **Evidence:** Transcript 028_abbas-rezaei_2025-07-15
  - Context: High-volume user "your situation is with Melio" - evaluating alternatives
  - Implied: Volume makes 1% fee unsustainable

**2. AP-Only Users (Easier to Displace)**
- **Pattern:** Customers using Melio exclusively for accounts payable (bill pay), not AR
- **Evidence:** Transcript 023_joan-schafer_2025-08-25
  - Quote: "we literally only use Melio to pay people, not get payments"
  - Context: Quest Cabinetry - easier to switch when only one side of business affected
  - Outcome: "moving over, if that makes sense from Melio is absolutely a possibility"

**3. Pricing Trust Broken (Fear of Future Increases)**
- **Pattern:** Customers who experienced "free → paid" pivot now fear continued price escalation
- **Evidence:** Transcript 023_joan-schafer_2025-08-25
  - Customer concern: "you guys are committed to that. You're not going to change over to 1%?"
  - Colton response: CEO article + "plenty of case studies...of why not to do that"
  - Evidence: "they've done some bigger price increases" [023:131] - ongoing escalation

**4. Support Frustration (Accessibility Issues)**
- **Pattern:** Customers frustrated by inability to reach Melio support
- **Evidence:** Transcript 023_joan-schafer_2025-08-25
  - Quote: "support can be really challenging to reach" (Colton validating known pattern)
  - Nickel positioning: "30-min to 1-hour live human" [023:145]
  - Outcome: Support accessibility as differentiator

**5. Bookkeeper Churn Creates Switching Windows**
- **Pattern:** When customer changes bookkeepers, opens opportunity to change tools
- **Evidence:** Transcript 023_joan-schafer_2025-08-25
  - Quote: "we had changed bookkeepers...that's what they use...then we were very unhappy with her. So we switched again...let's just not change anything"
  - Context: Bookkeeper 1 mandated Melio → customer unhappy → switched bookkeepers → inertia kept Melio BUT openness to change
  - Opportunity: "let's just work with Melio" (for now) → "moving over...is absolutely a possibility"

### When Nickel Loses to Melio

**1. Low-Volume Users Benefiting from Free Tier**
- **Pattern:** If customer only needs <5 payments/month, Melio's free tier sufficient
- **Evidence:** [INFERRED: "5 per month" free tier mentioned in pricing context]
- **Mitigation:** Position Nickel Plus value beyond just cost (speed, support, features)

**2. Existing Integration Satisfaction + Low Switching Motivation**
- **Pattern:** If Melio working well and integrated, inertia prevents change
- **Evidence:** Transcript 023:64 "let's just not change anything"
- **Mitigation:** Lead with savings calculation to create urgency

**3. Bookkeeper/Accountant Lock-In**
- **Pattern:** Bookkeeper mandates Melio as part of their workflow, customer has no choice
- **Evidence:** Transcript 023_joan-schafer_2025-08-25
  - Quote: "we had changed bookkeepers...that's what they use. And so in order to get on with her, that's what we used"
  - Context: Customer forced to adopt Melio to work with bookkeeper
- **Mitigation:** Target accounting firms directly (like Hardy Butler - 150 clients), flip the advisors

**4. Brand-Conscious Buyers (Melio More Established)**
- **Pattern:** Customers preferring "safe" choice despite pricing
- **Evidence:** [INFERRED: Melio maintains 19.3% mindshare despite pricing issues]
- **Mitigation:** G2 reviews, "already profitable" business model proof

## Displacement Strategy

### Recommended Approach
**Lead with "Melio Pricing Comparison Calculator"** - Show exact cost escalation vs Nickel's flat fee for their volume.

### Positioning Statement
```
"Melio used to be free. Then in September 2022, they followed QuickBooks' lead
and added a 1% ACH fee overnight.

Let's do the math on your payment volume:

If you're doing $50k/month in payments:
- Melio: $500/month in fees = $6,000/year
- Nickel: $420/year flat (unlimited transactions)
- Your savings: $5,580/year (93% savings)

If you're doing $100k/month in payments:
- Melio: $1,000/month in fees = $12,000/year
- Nickel: $420/year flat (unlimited transactions)
- Your savings: $11,580/year (96% savings)

Even if you take their $90/month 'top tier,' you're paying $1,080/year -
more than double our annual cost.

Our CEO wrote a detailed breakdown showing how Melio's pricing hurt small businesses:
[Link CEO article]

We built Nickel so businesses never face that bait-and-switch again.

Same QuickBooks integration. Better support. None of the surprises."
```

### What to Avoid
- ❌ **DON'T** attack Melio's product quality (integration works, features solid)
- ❌ **DON'T** claim bigger network (they have larger customer base)
- ❌ **DON'T** ignore that some low-volume users benefit from free tier
- ❌ **DON'T** compete on brand recognition (they're more established)

### Key Messaging Pillars

**1. Pricing Calculator (PRIMARY DIFFERENTIATOR)**
- "Volume users: calculate your savings with Nickel vs Melio's 1%"
- "$50k/month = $6k/year Melio vs $420 Nickel (93% savings)"
- "$100k/month = $12k/year Melio vs $420 Nickel (96% savings)"
- "We won't change to 1% - it's our founding principle"

**2. Trust & Commitment (EMOTIONAL DIFFERENTIATOR)**
- "Melio promised free, then switched to 1% - we won't do that"
- "CEO article documenting why we'll never make Melio's mistake"
- "Already profitable - we don't need to pivot pricing like they did"
- "Free ACH is our founding principle, not a marketing tactic"

## Strategic Recommendations

### For Product Team
1. **Build Melio CSV import tool:** Automate migration (reduce friction)
2. **Maintain support quality:** "30-min live human" is key differentiator vs Melio
3. **Monitor QB integration:** Melio has no issues here - keep parity
4. **Consider volume pricing alerts:** Help customers calculate Melio savings

### For Sales Team
1. **Lead with pricing calculator:** Show exact savings based on their volume
2. **Ask qualifying questions:**
   - "Are you currently using Melio? What's your monthly payment volume?"
   - "How much are you paying in Melio fees per month?"
   - "Do you use Melio for AP, AR, or both?" (AP-only easier to switch)
3. **Address sustainability objection:** CEO article + "already profitable" + "won't pivot pricing"
4. **Offer migration support:** "Countless Melio customers" have switched - CSV export pathway
5. **Target accounting firms:** Flip the advisors (Hardy Butler pattern - 150 clients)

### For Marketing Team
1. **Create "Melio Pricing Calculator" tool:** Input monthly volume → see savings
2. **SEO targeting:** "Melio alternative," "Melio pricing too high," "Melio vs Nickel"
3. **Content:** "The True Cost of Melio's 1% Fee" (detailed breakdowns by volume)
4. **Case studies:** Joan Schafer (bookkeeper lock-in → openness), Hardy Butler (accounting firm)
5. **Amplify CEO article:** Make it centerpiece of "anti-bait-and-switch" positioning
6. **Review monitoring:** Track Melio G2 reviews for pricing complaints, reach out to unhappy reviewers

### For Customer Success
1. **Onboarding messaging:** Reinforce "we won't do what Melio did" in welcome materials
2. **Migration support:** CSV import process documentation
3. **Pricing transparency:** Annual reminders of pricing commitment
4. **Referral incentives:** Melio churners likely to refer others in same situation
