# Use Case: High-Volume Accounts Payable Processing

## Summary
Businesses processing significant AP volume (either high transaction count or high dollar amounts) need cost-effective, reliable payment processing that eliminates checks, reduces bank fees, and accelerates payment delivery to vendors.

## Description
High-volume AP users are typically:
- **By transaction count:** 50+ payments per month
- **By dollar volume:** $100K+ in monthly AP spend
- **By transaction size:** Individual payments over $25K

These businesses face pain points with:
- Expensive bank wire fees ($15-30 per wire)
- Per-transaction ACH fees ($3-7 per ACH at banks)
- Slow ACH processing (3-5 days)
- Check fraud risk and manual processing burden
- Platform fees at traditional AP solutions (Bill.com at $45-60/month minimum)

## Fit Assessment

### Excellent Fit Indicators
- **Monthly AP volume:** $100K+ or 50+ transactions
- **Transaction size:** Regular payments over $25K (requires Plus plan)
- **Payment methods:** ACH and wire only, no checks
- **Cost sensitivity:** Seeking to eliminate per-transaction fees
- **Speed requirements:** Need same-day or next-day payment delivery
- **QuickBooks users:** Want automated sync for AP transactions

### Moderate Fit Indicators
- **Monthly AP volume:** $25K-100K
- **Transaction size:** Mix of small and large payments
- **Some check usage:** Transitioning away from checks
- **Platform fee tolerance:** Willing to pay $35-45/month for better solution

### Poor Fit Indicators
- **Low volume:** Less than $25K monthly AP spend
- **Infrequent payments:** Less than 10 payments per month
- **Complex approval workflows:** Require multi-level approval hierarchies
- **International payments:** Primarily paying overseas vendors
- **Check preference:** Require check printing and mailing

## Indicators from Transcripts

### Erik Meza (NLT LLC)
**Quote:** "On the expenditure, it would be relatively... anywhere between 500,000 to maybe 800,000 annually"
- **Annual AP credit card spend:** $500K-800K
- **ACH volume:** 5-10 monthly ACH transactions ($50-100K total)
- **Payment methods:** Business and personal Amex cards, ACH
- **Pain point:** Seeking volume discount to reduce transaction costs
- **Outcome:** Volume below $2M discount threshold, but solid product user

### Hardy Butler (Accounting Firm)
**Quote:** "For our smaller clients who need to be able to make an ACH payment occasionally from time to time. I don't want to have to pay $7 to a bank"
- **Use case:** Enabling low-volume clients (covered in separate use case)
- **Platform comparison:** Bill.com works for high-volume, too expensive for small clients
- **Pain point:** Banks charge $7 per ACH, prohibitive for occasional use
- **Broader context:** Managing 150 clients, many with AP needs across volume spectrum

**Quote:** "I need to be able to make an ACH payment inexpensively as needed, as if it were a bank transaction and not an act of Congress"
- **Pain point:** Current ACH processes too complex and expensive
- **Desired state:** Simple, zero-fee ACH like a bank transfer
- **Check washing:** "No question that with all the check washing going on, electronic payment is by far the safest method"

### Jeff Streich (Prime Renovations)
**Quote:** "Each job seems to be averaging about 700,000" + "$300K average invoices" + "Only [ACH and wire], no checks"
- **Project size:** $700K average per project
- **AP transaction size:** ~$300K average payments to subcontractors
- **Annual volume:** $3M currently, scaling to $10M target
- **Payment methods:** ACH and wire only, eliminated all checks
- **Pain points:**
  - TD Bank: $15 per wire fee ("outgoing wire is 15 bucks")
  - QuickBooks Pay: "Increased pricing, took days and days for ACHs, seemed a little pain in the ass"
  - Cash flow: "Cash flow sucks sometimes. Miserable." - trying to wait for client payments

## Implementation Path

### Phase 1: Assessment (Week 1)
1. **Quantify current AP volume:**
   - Monthly transaction count
   - Monthly dollar volume
   - Average transaction size
   - Largest transaction size
2. **Identify current pain points:**
   - Per-transaction fees currently paying
   - Processing delays
   - Check fraud risk
   - Manual reconciliation time
3. **Determine plan fit:**
   - If all transactions under $25K: Core (free) plan works
   - If any transactions over $25K: Plus plan required
   - If need scheduled/recurring payments: Plus plan required

### Phase 2: Setup (Week 1-2)
1. **Account creation:** Sign up for appropriate plan
2. **Bank connection:** Link business bank account for ACH funding
3. **Vendor import:**
   - Option A: CSV upload of existing vendor list
   - Option B: Manual entry as payments are made
   - Option C: QuickBooks sync (if applicable)
4. **Team setup:** Invite team members, assign roles/permissions
5. **QuickBooks integration:** (if using) Link QB account for real-time sync

### Phase 3: Testing (Week 2-3)
1. **Test payment:** Send small ACH to trusted vendor
2. **Verify processing time:** Confirm same-day/2-day delivery
3. **Check QuickBooks sync:** (if applicable) Ensure payment posts correctly
4. **Validate vendor experience:** Confirm vendor received payment properly
5. **Test large transaction:** (if Plus plan) Send $25K+ payment to verify limit

### Phase 4: Migration (Week 3-4)
1. **Notify vendors:** Update payment method expectations
2. **Collect vendor info:** Gather ACH details (routing/account numbers)
3. **Schedule payments:** Use scheduling feature for planned payments
4. **Set up recurring:** Automate repeat vendor payments (rent, subscriptions, etc.)
5. **Stop check printing:** Eliminate checks once electronic payments proven

### Phase 5: Optimization (Month 2+)
1. **Track savings:** Calculate bank fee reduction (wires, ACH fees, checks)
2. **Improve cash flow:** Use scheduled payments to optimize float
3. **Expand usage:** Move ALL AP through Nickel (not just some)
4. **Train team:** Ensure all AP staff comfortable with workflows
5. **Review volume:** If volume increased, consider Plus plan upgrade (or downgrade)

## Common Objections

### "We're happy with our current solution"
- **If Bill.com:** "Many customers use Bill.com for high-volume and love it. Curious, are there any pain points with pricing or complexity? We're often a great fit alongside Bill.com for certain workflows or as a simpler alternative."
- **If Relay Financial:** "Relay's great for banking. Key differences: we offer unlimited free ACH (vs 10/month cap), lower pricing ($35-45 vs $90), and built-in invoice/AR capabilities if you need them."
- **If satisfied bank:** "Glad your bank works. Main benefits customers see: eliminate per-transaction fees (we're $0 for ACH), faster processing, and QuickBooks automation if you use it."

### "Our transaction sizes are too large"
**Answer:** Nickel Plus plan supports up to $1M per ACH transaction. What's your largest typical payment? [If over $1M: Not a fit. If under: Plus plan at $35-45/month solves this.]

### "We need wire transfers, not just ACH"
**Answer:** You're right, we don't offer wires today. ACH works for most customers and processes same-day to 2-day on our Plus plan. For urgent payments requiring same-day wire delivery, you'd still need your bank. Many customers use us for 90% of payments (ACH) and bank for occasional wires.

### "We need check printing"
**Answer:** We're focused on electronic payments (ACH). If you still need occasional checks, you'd print those separately or use your bank/QuickBooks. Most customers eliminate 90-100% of checks by switching to ACH, which also eliminates check fraud risk.

### "We have complex approval workflows"
**Answer:** Nickel is optimized for simpler, faster workflows. If you need multi-level approvals, budget controls, and policy enforcement, Bill.com might be a better fit. We're ideal for businesses that want speed and simplicity without heavy process overhead.
