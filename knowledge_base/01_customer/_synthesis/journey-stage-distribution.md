## Journey Stage Characteristics

### Discovery Stage (58-63% of corpus)

**What prospects are doing:**
- Learning about Nickel's capabilities (AR, AP, integrations)
- Understanding pricing and plans
- Assessing fit for their use case
- Comparing to awareness of other solutions (may not be actively evaluating yet)

**Common signals in transcripts:**
- "I saw your website..."
- "Can you walk me through how this works?"
- "What integrations do you have?"
- "Tell me about pricing"
- First-time demo requests

**Typical timeline:** 2-4 weeks in discovery before moving to evaluation

**Conversion challenge:** Many prospects in discovery are not yet ready to buy. They're exploring options, not actively comparing. Goal is to create urgency and move them to evaluation.

### Evaluation Stage (30-36% of corpus)

**What prospects are doing:**
- Actively comparing Nickel to Bill.com, Melio, QuickBooks Payments, Stripe
- Assessing fit against specific requirements (e.g., QuickBooks integration, ACH fees, credit card rates)
- Calculating ROI (cost savings, time savings)
- Testing platform (trials, demo accounts)
- Internal stakeholder alignment (if multiple decision-makers)

**Common signals in transcripts:**
- "We're currently using [Competitor] but..."
- "How do you compare to [Competitor]?"
- "I'm evaluating a few options"
- "What's your ACH fee?" (cost comparison)
- Detailed technical questions (integration workflows, security, compliance)

**Typical timeline:** 1-3 weeks in evaluation before decision

**Conversion challenge:** Competitive pressure. Prospects are comparing multiple solutions. Must differentiate on cost, UX, support, and speed.

### Decision Stage (5-7% of corpus)

**What prospects are doing:**
- Final validation before commitment
- Confirming pricing, contract terms
- Planning implementation
- Addressing final objections

**Common signals in transcripts:**
- "I'm ready to move forward"
- "When can we get started?"
- "What's the implementation timeline?"
- "Do you have a contract for me to review?"
- Post-demo, ready to sign up

**Typical timeline:** Days to 1 week from decision to close

**Conversion challenge:** Don't lose the deal at the finish line. Make signup/onboarding frictionless.

### Follow-up / Check-in Stage (3-6% of corpus)

**What prospects/customers are doing:**
- Post-signup onboarding support
- Implementation assistance (QuickBooks integration setup, customer imports)
- Account issues (compliance denials, payment processing problems)
- Feature adoption (learning advanced features like recurring billing, payment authorizations)

**Common signals in transcripts:**
- "Nickel kick-off call"
- "Check-in"
- "Review call"
- Compliance/support issues

**Note:** These are often already-converted customers, not prospects. Tracked here because they appear in transcript corpus.

## Discovery Trigger Impact on Journey Stage

### Compliance Denial Trigger
- **Entry Stage:** Follow-up (customer was onboarded, then denied)
- **Urgency:** CRITICAL
- **Timeline:** 1-2 weeks to resolution or churn
- **Pattern:** Customer accelerates through decision → gets blocked → needs resolution to continue

### Customer Requesting Net Terms Trigger
- **Entry Stage:** Discovery (35%), Evaluation (50%), Decision (15%)
- **Urgency:** MEDIUM (escalates if deal at risk)
- **Timeline:** 2-6 weeks from trigger to close
- **Pattern:** Trigger moves prospects from passive discovery → active evaluation

### Referral from Network Trigger
- **Entry Stage:** Discovery (60%), Evaluation (35%), Decision (5%)
- **Urgency:** MEDIUM (pre-qualified but not urgent)
- **Timeline:** 2-4 weeks from referral to close
- **Pattern:** Referrals enter at discovery but move FASTER through stages (trust + pre-qualification)

### Cash Flow Crisis Trigger
- **Entry Stage:** Discovery (30%), Evaluation (50%), Decision (20%)
- **Urgency:** HIGH
- **Timeline:** 1-3 weeks from trigger to close
- **Pattern:** Cash flow pain creates urgency, accelerates evaluation → decision

### Demo Request Inbound Trigger
- **Entry Stage:** Discovery (65%), Evaluation (30%), Decision (5%)
- **Urgency:** MEDIUM (varies widely)
- **Timeline:** 2-6 weeks from demo to close
- **Pattern:** Most common entry point. Discovery demos are educational, evaluation demos are competitive comparisons.

## Journey Stage Conversion Patterns

### Discovery → Evaluation Conversion

**What moves prospects from discovery to evaluation:**
1. **Urgency Creation:** Quantify cost of delay (fees wasted per month, deals lost)
2. **Pain Amplification:** Help prospect realize current situation is unsustainable
3. **Competitive Awareness:** "Most businesses we work with are comparing us to Bill.com and Melio. Would you like to see how we compare?"
4. **Trial Offer:** "Want to test it hands-on? I can set up a trial account right now."

**Timeline Acceleration Factors:**
- Active pain point (high costs, poor UX, fraud incident)
- Deal at risk (need solution fast to win/retain customer)
- Referral (pre-qualified, trusted source)
- Competitor awareness (already know they need to switch)

**Timeline Deceleration Factors:**
- No urgency (proactive exploration, no acute pain)
- Budget uncertainty (need to secure funding/approval)
- Stakeholder complexity (multiple decision-makers, slow internal process)

### Evaluation → Decision Conversion

**What moves prospects from evaluation to decision:**
1. **Clear Differentiation:** Show how Nickel is better than competitors on metrics that matter (cost, UX, speed, support)
2. **ROI Proof:** Quantify savings or revenue impact (cost calculator, case study)
3. **Social Proof:** Show testimonials, customer count, G2 reviews
4. **Risk Mitigation:** Free trial, free plan, easy setup, excellent support
5. **Urgency:** "Every month you wait, you're paying $X in unnecessary fees"

**Timeline Acceleration Factors:**
- High-urgency trigger (compliance denial, cash flow crisis, deal at risk)
- Single decision-maker (owner-operator, small business)
- Clear competitive advantage (Nickel obviously better on key criteria)
- Easy implementation (QuickBooks integration, CSV import, fast setup)

**Timeline Deceleration Factors:**
- Competitive alternatives performing well in evaluation
- Price concerns (scrutinizing costs)
- Implementation concerns (bandwidth, complexity)
- Stakeholder alignment needed (multiple approvers)

### Strategic Recommendations

#### 1. Accelerate Discovery → Evaluation

**Goal:** Move prospects from passive exploration to active comparison faster.

**Tactics:**
- **Urgency Creation:** In discovery calls, quantify cost of delay: "Based on your transaction volume, you're paying $X per month in unnecessary fees. That's $Y per year."
- **Competitive Framing:** "Most businesses we work with are also evaluating Bill.com and Melio. Would you like to see a side-by-side comparison?"
- **Trial Acceleration:** "Let's get you into a trial account today so you can test it hands-on while we're on this call."
- **Pain Amplification:** Use discovery questions to help prospect realize current situation is worse than they thought.

#### 2. Win the Evaluation Stage

**Goal:** Differentiate against Bill.com, Melio, QuickBooks Payments, Stripe to win competitive evaluations.

**Tactics:**
- **Competitive Content:** Create "Nickel vs. [Competitor]" comparison pages (cost, features, UX, support)
- **ROI Proof:** Build savings calculator showing exact cost difference vs. competitors
- **Social Proof:** Showcase testimonials from customers who switched from competitors
- **Differentiation:** Emphasize free ACH (competitors charge), superior UX (easier than Bill.com), faster support (vs. competitors)

#### 3. Reduce Evaluation → Decision Friction

**Goal:** Shorten evaluation cycles and reduce drop-off at decision stage.

**Tactics:**
- **Free Trial Emphasis:** Make trial prominent, frictionless (one-click activation from demo)
- **Free Plan Option:** For cost-sensitive prospects, lead with free plan (zero risk)
- **Fast Onboarding:** Promise "first payment within 24 hours" (reduces implementation fear)
- **Next Steps Commitment:** Every demo ends with scheduled next action (trial start date, follow-up meeting, decision date)

#### 4. Trigger-Based Journey Optimization

**Goal:** Customize sales motion based on discovery trigger and journey stage.

**Tactics:**
- **High-Urgency Triggers:** Compress timeline, prioritize fast response, minimize friction
- **Referral Triggers:** Leverage referrer trust, ask referrer to reinforce recommendation during evaluation
- **Cash Flow Triggers:** Lead with free plan, show cost savings, minimize switching costs
- **Net Terms Triggers:** Emphasize payment flexibility, calculate revenue impact of winning bigger deals

#### 5. Stage-Specific Metrics & Tracking

**Goal:** Measure conversion at each stage to identify bottlenecks.

**Metrics to Track:**
- Discovery → Evaluation conversion rate
- Evaluation → Decision conversion rate
- Overall discovery → close conversion rate
- Average time in each stage
- Drop-off points (where prospects go dark)
- Trigger-specific conversion rates (referral vs. cold vs. urgency-driven)
