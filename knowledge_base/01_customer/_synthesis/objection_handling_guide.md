# TODO: Phase 3 Deliverable

**Phase 3 deliverable - stub created in Phase 2 Iteration 1**

This document will be populated during Phase 3 (Crystallization) to synthesize the 5 objection pattern documents into a comprehensive sales enablement guide that equips the team with proven responses, supporting evidence, and conversion strategies for each objection type.

## Planned Structure

### Objection Overview
- Complete catalog of identified objections
- Frequency by persona and sales stage
- Correlation with deal outcomes (win/loss)
