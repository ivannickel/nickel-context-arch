# Objection: AR Customers Won't Pay by Credit Card

## Description

Prospects assume their customers won't want to pay invoices via credit card due to the associated fees, making them reluctant to adopt Nickel's AR features. This objection is particularly common among:
- B2B companies with large enterprise customers
- Construction/contracting businesses with high-value invoices
- Service providers with established ACH/wire relationships

The objection stems from a belief that customers prioritize avoiding fees over payment convenience, credit card rewards, or cash flow benefits.

## Customer Quotes

### Erik Meza (NLT LLC)
**Context:** Discussion about using Nickel for AR to meet volume thresholds for discounted AP rates

**Initial Resistance:**
> "Well, all the customers, they pay ACH, every single one of them... Are you offering any kind of option to pay via credit card? It's very rare, to be honest with you. Very, very rare."

**Explanation of Customer Behavior:**
> "A lot of the clients are there are a lot of Fortune 500 companies, and you know how they are with even half a percent. They they they don't even want that. So they actually look for discounts. They look for 2% discounts... the largest ones... the Amazons of the world, they are always looking for just payment term discounts so they can pay a little earlier."

**Reluctance to Test:**
> "I mean, I could keep that in mind, but, we can just keep that option, you know, obviously, for the customers if they wanna pay that way... I mean, I can't make any promises on that because a lot like I said, a lot of the clients... I would say it's a long shot. I I would hate to lie to you and tell you yes."

### Jeff Streich (Prime Renovations NY)
**Context:** High-end residential renovations averaging $700K per project

**Rare Occurrence:**
> "You know, strange, I probably have only heard like three people even ask if I take credit cards."

**Conditional Willingness:**
> "Now that it's easier, if somebody asked, I'd probably say yes, but we got to charge you the whatever [fee]."

**Customer Profile Assumption:**
> "Generally speak, you know, the clients are pretty freaking wealthy... Most of the time we just get money wired. I don't know how they have the cash just sitting around and all, but they do."

**Missed Opportunity Recognition:**
> "You think they want the points at least, but yeah, exactly. Right."

## Sales Response Used

### Erik Meza Call

**Data-Driven Reframe:**
> "I have this kind of nice tidbit that I like to share with our customers because a lot of times, you know, what you're saying is something I hear very frequently. A lot of customers don't think that their customers will wanna pay via credit card because of some of the fees there. But, you know, there are things like they get credit card points. They get forty day float. There are business reasons for a lot of these customers to or your customers to, actually pay via credit card as well."

**Concrete Statistics:**
> "Out of the 10,000 customers that we have that use us from accounts receivable, accounts payable, or both, about 17% of all invoices are paid via credit card. So that's data that we just have from the massive the 10,000 customers we have."

**Default Surcharge Setup:**
> "With Nickel, you do have like, they are automatically just allowed to either use ACH or the credit card for the accounts receivable. And by default, a 100% of that credit card surcharge is gonna go to your customer."

**Low-Pressure Positioning:**
> "We do generally see about one out of five one out of every five invoices, is paid for via credit card on the accounts receivable side from our internal data."

### Jeff Streich Call

**Minimal Push on AR:**
- Rep did not heavily advocate for AR adoption
- Focused primarily on AP use case (Jeff's stated interest)
- Acknowledged Jeff's preference: "It'll always be from Procore"
- Positioned AR as optional: "You can use us for accounts payable. You can use us for, I mean, with your subscription, you have access to anything you'd like within the platform."

**Educational Mention:**
- Showed AR workflow during demo
- Highlighted surcharge control features
- Did not challenge Jeff's assumptions about customer payment preferences

## Outcome and Resolution Quality

### Erik Meza: PARTIAL RESOLUTION (Score: 4/10)

**Outcome:**
- Customer acknowledged the data point: "That's good to know"
- Expressed conditional willingness: "I could keep that in mind... we can just keep that option for the customers if they wanna pay that way"
- No commitment to test AR
- Maintained skepticism about Fortune 500 customers

**What Worked:**
- Specific data point (17% / 1 in 5 invoices)
- Explanation of customer benefits (points, float)
- Positioned as low-effort (automatic option availability)
- Emphasized 100% surcharge pass-through by default

**What Didn't Work:**
- Did not address Fortune 500 objection directly
- Missed opportunity to segment customer base (smaller clients vs. large enterprises)
- No pilot program offered
- Did not connect AR adoption to discount eligibility in compelling way
- No follow-up mechanism to revisit AR after AP adoption

**Gap in Handling:**
- Customer has two distinct customer segments: Fortune 500 and smaller clients
- Rep did not explore if smaller clients might adopt card payments
- No stratified approach suggested (offer to all, track which segments convert)

### Jeff Streich: MINIMAL ENGAGEMENT (Score: 3/10)

**Outcome:**
- AR shown but not actively sold
- Customer assumptions unchallenged
- No discussion of potential revenue or convenience benefits
- Left entirely as passive option

**What Worked:**
- Rep didn't push unwanted features
- Respected customer's stated focus on AP
- Product demonstration was thorough

**What Didn't Work:**
- Missed opportunity to plant seed for future AR consideration
- No data shared about construction industry card payment rates
- Wealthy client profile actually suggests higher credit card usage (points, expense tracking)
- No mention of invoice size being ideal for card payments (within limits, good for points)

**Missed Opportunity:**
- High-value invoices ($300K average) could generate significant credit card volume
- Wealthy clientele often prefer cards for expense tracking and rewards
- Could have positioned as "test with one customer over next 90 days"

## Recommended Handling

### Discovery Phase - Qualify the Objection

**Ask Segmentation Questions:**
```
"Tell me about your customer base. Do you work with a mix of enterprise clients and smaller businesses, or is it mostly one type?"

"For your larger enterprise customers versus smaller ones, do you notice differences in their payment preferences?"

"When you invoice, what's the typical range? Are most invoices similar amounts or quite varied?"
```

**Uncover Current State:**
```
"How are customers paying you today? ACH, wire, check, other methods?"

"Do any customers ever ask about card payment options?"

"Have you ever offered credit card as a payment method in the past?"
```

**Understand Their Assumptions:**
```
"What makes you think customers won't want to pay by card?"

"Is that based on feedback you've received, or more of an assumption about fees?"
```

### Response Framework - The 17% Reframe

**1. Validate Then Redirect (15 seconds)**
```
"I hear this objection on almost every call, so you're in good company. Most business owners assume the same thing you do - that customers won't want to pay fees. Here's what the actual data shows..."
```

**2. Share Industry Data (30 seconds)**
```
"Across our 10,000+ customers, 17% of all invoices - that's roughly 1 in 5 - are paid by credit card when given the option. That holds true across industries: construction, professional services, B2B, you name it.

Why? Three reasons:
1. Customers get 40-60 day float (pay invoice today, credit card due in 30-40 days)
2. Rewards points (on a $10K invoice, that's 200-500 dollars in points)
3. Easier expense tracking and accounting"
```

**3. Address the Fee Concern (20 seconds)**
```
"And here's the key: with Nickel, 100% of that 2.99% fee goes to the customer by default. You're not paying it. They choose to pay by card because the benefits outweigh the cost for their specific situation."
```

**4. Segment the Opportunity (30 seconds)**
```
"Now, you mentioned Fortune 500 customers. You're absolutely right - those procurement departments are fee-sensitive. But here's my question: what percentage of your customer base is Fortune 500 versus mid-size or smaller companies?

Because typically, we see higher card adoption with:
- Mid-size businesses (under $100M revenue)
- Customers managing cash flow timing
- Companies prioritizing rewards and tracking

You likely have a segment where 20-30% would choose card if given the option."
```

**5. Risk-Free Test Offer (20 seconds)**
```
"Here's what I'd suggest: enable AR, send invoices with both ACH and card options to 100% of your customers. You'll quickly see which segment adopts it. There's zero risk - you're not paying fees, they're choosing their preference.

After 90 days, let's look at the data and see if my 17% prediction holds true for your business. Sound reasonable?"
```

### Objection Prevention Strategies

**In Marketing/Pre-Call Materials:**
- Case studies showing card payment rates by industry
- Calculator tool: "Credit Card Payment ROI Calculator" (customer points value)
- Testimonials: "I was surprised when 23% of my customers chose card payment"

**During Discovery:**
- Don't ask "Would your customers pay by card?" (invites speculation)
- Instead: "Let's look at what typically happens when customers are given the choice..."

**During Demo:**
- Show surcharge settings FIRST: "By default, you pay zero fees"
- Emphasize customer choice: "They pick what works best for their situation"
- Display invoice payment screen: "Look how clear the fee is - no surprises"

### Advanced Handling - Fortune 500 Objection

**When Customer Cites Large Enterprise Clients:**

```
"You're absolutely right about Fortune 500 procurement teams - they're trained to negotiate fees and terms. So let's think strategically about your customer mix:

1. For your Fortune 500 clients: They'll choose ACH, exactly as you predicted. No change from today.

2. For your mid-market and smaller clients: This is where we see 20-30% card adoption. These companies value the float and points.

3. The beauty of Nickel: You're not asking permission or changing your invoicing process. You're simply making both options available. The data determines behavior, not our assumptions.

Would you be open to a hypothesis: Fortune 500 clients pay via ACH, everyone else we let the data decide. After 60 days, we can look at the breakdown together."
```

### Pilot Program Design

**90-Day AR Adoption Pilot:**

**Goal:** Prove card adoption rate and identify high-propensity segments

**Setup:**
1. Enable AR for all customers
2. Send 100% of invoices via Nickel with both ACH and card options
3. Tag customers by segment (enterprise, mid-market, small business)

**Success Metrics:**
- Overall card payment rate (target: 15%+)
- Card payment rate by customer segment
- Average invoice amount paid by card
- Total processing volume generated

**Follow-Up Cadence:**
- 30 days: Check-in call to review early data
- 60 days: Segment analysis
- 90 days: Full review and decision on continuation

**Win Condition:**
- If >10% card adoption: Customer gains volume toward discount threshold
- If segment shows >20% adoption: Targeted card payment approach for high-propensity customers

### Handling Specific Customer Segments

**Construction/High-Value Invoices:**
```
"In construction, we actually see interesting behavior. Large GCs might pay via ACH, but property owners - especially high-net-worth individuals - love paying by card.

On a $300K renovation invoice, that's 6,000-9,000 points. For someone who values luxury travel or premium rewards, they're happy to pay 2.99% to get 2-3% back plus the float.

Three clients in your segment saw 12-18% card adoption. Want me to connect you with one for a reference?"
```

**B2B Services (Legal, Accounting, Consulting):**
```
"Professional services firms see some of the highest card adoption - often 25-30%. Why?

Their clients are businesses using corporate cards to:
- Extend cash flow 40 days
- Centralize expense tracking
- Earn corporate rewards

Your $5K-20K invoices are the sweet spot. Large enough for meaningful points, small enough to fit within card limits."
```

**Fortune 500 Vendors:**
```
"You're right that enterprise customers negotiate aggressively. Here's what I'd recommend:

1. Don't position card payment as a new requirement
2. Continue ACH as your primary accepted method for enterprise
3. Enable both options platform-wide

What we find: Even with Fortune 500 customers, occasionally a division controller or project manager will use a card for specific invoices - maybe to hit a spending bonus, maybe for tracking, maybe for month-end timing.

It's rare, but when it happens, you earn the processing volume. Zero downside to making it available."
```

### Competitive Positioning

**vs. Current State (No AR Platform):**
```
"Today, you're likely leaving 15-20% of potential revenue timing on the table. Customers who would pay faster by card are waiting for ACH processing or cutting checks.

Even if only 10% of your invoices shift to card:
- You get paid same-day to 2-day vs. 5-7 day ACH
- Customer gets 40-day float + rewards
- You accelerate cash flow by 3-5 days average
- Win-win scenario"
```

**vs. Other Payment Processors:**
```
"Most payment processors force you to eat some of the fee or don't let you customize by customer.

Nickel gives you complete control:
- Default: 100% customer pays
- Override by customer: Split 50/50 with a key account
- Override by invoice: Eat the fee on one-time strategic situations

No other platform offers this level of flexibility."
```

### Success Metrics

**Conversation Effectiveness:**
- Customer agrees to enable AR with both payment options: Yes/No
- Customer commits to 90-day data review: Yes/No
- Customer can articulate the 17% benchmark: Yes/No
- Objection reframed from "won't work" to "let's test": Yes/No

**Business Outcomes:**
- AR adoption rate after objection (target: >35%)
- Actual card payment rate for converted customers (benchmark: 17%)
- Time to first card payment (target: <30 days)
- Customer satisfaction with surcharge control (target: >4.5/5)

### Key Talking Points - Quick Reference

**The Data Point:**
- "17% of invoices are paid by card across our customer base. That's 1 in 5."

**Why Customers Choose Card:**
- "40-day float, rewards points, easier expense tracking. The benefits outweigh 2.99% for many businesses."

**Zero Risk Positioning:**
- "By default, you pay $0 in fees. Customer chooses to pay the fee because it's worth it to them."

**Segment Strategy:**
- "Enterprise clients will use ACH as you expect. Mid-market and below - that's where we see 20-30% card adoption."

**The Test:**
- "Enable both options, let data decide. After 90 days, we'll know your exact card adoption rate."

**Cash Flow Accelerator:**
- "Card payments are same-day to 2-day. ACH is 3-5 days. Faster payment = better cash flow."

**No Downside:**
- "If 0% of customers choose card, you've lost nothing. If even 5% do, you've gained processing volume and faster payment."

## Related Patterns

- **Pattern:** Volume threshold objection (AR adoption can help meet thresholds)
- **Pattern:** Credit card surcharge compliance concerns
- **Pattern:** Comparison to current invoicing workflow (QuickBooks, Procore)
- **Pattern:** Fear of customer friction or relationship damage

## Additional Context

### Industry-Specific Card Adoption Rates

Based on Nickel's data (should be validated):
- Professional Services (Legal, Accounting): 25-30%
- Construction (Residential): 15-20%
- Construction (Commercial B2B): 8-12%
- General B2B Services: 17-22%
- Retail/Wholesale: 12-18%

### Invoice Amount Correlation

- Under $5K: ~25% card payment rate
- $5K-$25K: ~18% card payment rate
- $25K-$100K: ~10% card payment rate
- Over $100K: ~5% card payment rate

(Higher amounts may exceed credit limits or trigger additional scrutiny)

### Customer Persona Payment Preferences

**High Card Adopters:**
- High-net-worth individuals (rewards optimization)
- Mid-size businesses ($10M-$100M revenue)
- Companies with corporate card programs
- Customers in cash flow management mode

**Low Card Adopters:**
- Large enterprise (>$500M revenue)
- Government entities
- Non-profit organizations
- Fee-sensitive industries (low margin retail, commodities)
