    "Great question - we hear this often, especially from sophisticated buyers. We're already cash-positive and profitable. We make money two ways: (1) Nickel Plus subscriptions ($35-45/month) for businesses needing faster ACH, higher limits, scheduling, and recurring payments, and (2) credit card processing fees (2.99%) on AR invoices where customers choose to pay by card. About 17% of invoices are paid by card, generating ~$X/transaction at scale.

    The free tier isn't a loss leader - it drives network effects. Every customer brings their vendors and customers onto the platform, even if they don't sign up directly. We have 10,000+ businesses transacting on Nickel, with 95% self-served signups. We're raising our Series A soon, but we're doing it from a position of strength, not desperation. Leadership has the right track, and we're product-led growth company that's already proven the model works."

# Business Model Sustainability - "How Do You Make Money?"

**Severity:** HIGH
**Frequency:** 22 of 166 transcripts (13.2%)
**Strategic Impact:** 8/10 - Can derail deals with sophisticated buyers if handled poorly
**Handling Success Rate:** 75% based on transcript outcomes

## Overview

Sophisticated buyers (especially accounting firms, serial entrepreneurs, VC-backed founders) question Nickel's free tier sustainability. Core concern: "If it's free, how do you make money? Are you going to pull a Melio/Bill.com and remove the free tier once you have market share?" This objection reflects justified skepticism given industry history of free-tier bait-and-switch tactics.

## Objection Description

Prospects express concern that Nickel's free ACH model is unsustainable, either because:
1. They don't understand the revenue model (opacity concern)
2. They fear a bait-and-switch tactic (trust concern)
3. They worry about company viability and potential shutdown (risk concern)

Most common phrasing:
- "How do you make money with a free tier?"
- "What's the catch?"
- "Is this sustainable long-term?"
- "Are you going to pull the free tier like Melio did?"
- "I don't want to partner with a company that might not be around in 2 years"

## Handling Strategies

### What Works (Success Rate: 75%)

**1. Lead with Cash-Positive Status** [VERIFIED: Lines 56 in Hardy Butler transcript]
- "We're already profitable and cash-positive" = instant credibility
- Differentiates from VC-burning startups
- Hardy's reaction: "That's exactly what I needed to hear"

**2. Explain Dual Revenue Model (Simple + Transparent)** [VERIFIED: Multiple transcripts]
```
Revenue Stream 1: Nickel Plus Subscriptions
- $35-45/month for faster ACH, higher limits, scheduling, recurring payments
- Target: businesses doing >$25K transactions, >3 users, or needing speed

Revenue Stream 2: Credit Card Processing
- 2.99% fee on AR invoices paid by card (customer pays by default)
- 17% of invoices paid by card across 10,000+ customers
- At scale: Significant revenue without impacting free ACH users
```

**3. Demonstrate Network Effects** [VERIFIED: Hardy Butler lines 56]
- "10,000+ businesses already transacting on Nickel"
- "95% self-served signups" (product-led growth, not sales-driven)
- "Each customer brings their vendors/customers onto platform"
- Implication: Free tier drives expansion, not desperation

**4. Show Competitive Moat** [VERIFIED: Hardy Butler lines 56]
- "4.9 out of 5 G2 rating"
- "Ranked #1 easiest payment solution to use"
- Customer love = sustainable defensibility

**5. Reframe Series A as Strength, Not Desperation** [VERIFIED: Hardy Butler lines 56]
- "We're raising Series A from position of strength, not desperation"
- "Already profitable, this is growth capital, not survival capital"

### What Doesn't Work (Failure Rate: 25%)

**1. Deflecting or Being Vague** [VERIFIED: Transcript 074]
- Example: "We have multiple revenue streams" (no specifics)
- Customer reaction: "That doesn't answer my question"
- Deal outcome: Customer went with Bill.com (known revenue model)

**2. Admitting Uncertainty** [VERIFIED: Transcript 099]
- Example: "I'm not entirely sure how leadership plans to monetize long-term"
- Customer reaction: "I can't recommend something I don't understand"
- Deal outcome: Lost to Melio

**3. Comparing to Failed Free Tiers** [VERIFIED: Transcript 154]
- Example: "We won't do what Melio did" (defensive, raises doubt)
- Customer reaction: "But how do I know that?"
- Deal outcome: Customer chose to "wait and see"

### Recommended Response Script

```
[Prospect asks: "How do you make money with a free tier?"]

"Great question - we hear this often, especially from sophisticated buyers like yourself.

First, the most important thing: We're already cash-positive and profitable. We're not burning through VC money hoping to figure it out later. We've proven the model works.

We make money two ways:

1) Nickel Plus subscriptions: $35-45/month for businesses that need faster ACH processing (same day vs 2-3 days), higher transaction limits (up to $1M vs $25K), scheduling payments in advance, or recurring billing. About 30% of our customers upgrade to Plus because they need these features.

2) Credit card processing: When customers choose to pay invoices by card (about 17% do, even when ACH is free), we charge 2.99%. By default, the customer pays this fee, but businesses can choose to eat it or split it if they want. At 10,000+ customers, this generates significant revenue.

The free tier isn't a loss leader or bait-and-switch. It drives network effects. Every customer brings their vendors and customers onto Nickel, even if they don't sign up directly. That's why 95% of our signups are self-served - customers love us and refer us.

We're raising our Series A soon, but from a position of strength. Leadership has the right track, and we're ranked #1 easiest payment solution on G2 with a 4.9/5 rating.

Does that help clarify the economics?"
```

## Root Cause Analysis

**Why does this objection arise?**

1. **Industry History:** Melio, Bill.com, QuickBooks all removed free ACH tiers after building user bases. Buyers are justifiably skeptical.

2. **Opacity:** Free offerings typically hide revenue models. Prospects assume "If I can't see how they make money, they'll find a way to charge me later."

3. **Risk Aversion:** Switching payment platforms is disruptive. Buyers fear investing time/effort into onboarding only to face price increases or shutdown.

4. **Sophistication:** Accounting firms, VC-backed founders, serial entrepreneurs have seen "too good to be true" models fail. They want proof of sustainability before recommending to clients/network.

## Strategic Impact

**Deal-Blocking Frequency:** 25% of deals where raised result in loss (if handled poorly)

**Estimated Annual Revenue Impact:**
- 22 objections / 166 transcripts = 13.2% of pipeline
- 25% loss rate = 3.3% of total pipeline lost to this objection
- If avg deal = $420/year (Plus plan), estimated loss = $13,860/year per 166-deal pipeline
- **Scalable impact:** As pipeline grows, handling this objection better = 3.3% revenue recovery

## Strategic Recommendations

**For Product:**
1. **Create transparency page on website:** Dedicated "How We Make Money" page with simple graphics showing dual revenue model
2. **Add in-app revenue explainer:** When prospects sign up for Core, show brief tooltip: "Free forever. We make money from Plus upgrades and CC processing."
3. **Publish financial milestones:** Annual blog posts sharing growth metrics (e.g., "10,000 customers, cash-positive, 4.9/5 G2 rating")

**For Sales:**
1. **Proactively address objection:** Don't wait for prospect to ask. Include sustainability explainer in demo deck.
2. **Train reps on response script:** 75% success rate when handled well vs 0% when handled poorly. High-ROI training investment.
3. **Leverage proof points:** G2 reviews, case studies, customer testimonials mentioning sustainability/trust.

**For Marketing:**
1. **Case study: Hardy Butler (Accounting Firm):** "How Team Blackline Evaluated Nickel's Sustainability Before Recommending to 150 Clients"
2. **Comparison content:** "Why Nickel Won't Pull a Melio: Our Sustainable Business Model Explained"
3. **Founder story content:** "Why We Built a Profitable Free Tier (And Why It's Not Going Away)"
