# Objection: Volume Threshold Too High for Discounted Rates

## Description

Prospects are interested in Nickel but request discounted credit card processing rates. However, their transaction volume does not meet Nickel's minimum threshold requirements for rate negotiations. The standard requirement is:
- $2M+ annual credit card spend on AP side PLUS good faith effort on AR side
- $5-6M annual spend for AP-only usage

This creates a qualification mismatch where smaller businesses cannot access custom pricing despite genuine interest.

## Customer Quotes

### Erik Meza (NLT LLC)
**Context:** Inquiring about discounted rates for high-volume AP transactions

> "We're using our American Express credit card... the volume, it looks about maybe between five to 10 ACHs on a monthly basis, which would vary anywhere between fifty to one hundred thousand dollars... on the expenditure, it would be relatively when I was when I mentioned about the 50 to 100, I would say anywhere between 500,000 to maybe 800,000 annually."

**Volume Gap:** Customer doing $500K-$800K annually vs. $2M+ requirement

> "Can I explain anything more in detail there for you? What do I get if I do meet that threshold?"

**Response Received:**
> "Unfortunately, that 800,000 in credit card spend isn't really enough to hit that threshold where we're able to make money back from it because, again, we are providing quite a set of generous features for free."

### Hardy Butler (Team Blackline - Accounting Firm)
**Context:** Fractional CFO firm with 150 clients seeking solution for smaller clients

> "I want to be able to send ACH payments in low volume or frankly on an as needed basis without paying an absurd monthly platform fee."

**Concern about value exchange:**
> "The fact that Nickel is free is nice. I mean, I don't know how you're making money, to be quite frank, and that's one of the things I want to find out... I don't mind paying for an ACH, a reasonable fee."

## Sales Response Used

### Erik Meza Call

**Approach:** Direct transparency about volume requirements

1. **Set expectations clearly:**
   - "We're not able to lower that rate unless the volume is there. Generally, they're looking at minimum $2,000,000."
   - "If you were just using us for accounts payable, they're generally looking at more of a 5 to $6,000,000 spend range."

2. **Explained value proposition:**
   - "We offer a really generous set of features, so lower rates for us are tough. The only way we can do that is if we make up for it in terms of volume."

3. **Provided concrete example:**
   - Referenced a previous successful negotiation: 2.9% reduced to 2.8% for customer meeting thresholds

4. **Suggested AR adoption:**
   - Shared data point: "Out of the 10,000 customers that we have... about 17% of all invoices are paid via credit card"
   - Offered to help customer explore AR side to potentially meet volume requirements

### Hardy Butler Call

**Approach:** Education about business model and value delivery

1. **Explained sustainability:**
   - "We're already a cash positive business... we're planning on raising our series A here in the near future"
   - "Each customer that comes on, it's very likely that they're gonna bring on multiple customers with them"

2. **Demonstrated network effects:**
   - "We already have over 10,000 businesses who are transacting with Nickel"
   - "4.9 out of five rating... ranked the number one easiest payment solution to use"

3. **Focused on free value:**
   - Emphasized unlimited free ACH with no hidden fees
   - Highlighted Nickel Plus at $35-45/month vs. competitors charging hundreds

## Outcome and Resolution Quality

### Erik Meza: PARTIAL RESOLUTION (Score: 5/10)

**Outcome:**
- Customer understood the threshold requirements
- No immediate path to discount
- Left door open: "I'll go ahead and continue to use Nickel platform... if for some reason we're able to go in and just make some adjustments, I have your number"
- No urgency: Rep noted "Doesn't sound urgent, though"

**What Worked:**
- Clear, transparent communication about requirements
- Concrete data point (17% credit card usage) for AR consideration
- Specific example of successful rate negotiation

**What Didn't Work:**
- No creative alternative solutions offered
- Missed opportunity to position free ACH value more strongly
- Didn't explore if AR volume could bridge the gap to threshold

**Next Steps Captured:**
- Customer to review AR volume potential
- No formal follow-up scheduled
- Passive relationship maintained

**Outcome:**
- Customer concerns about sustainability addressed

## Recommended Handling

### Immediate Response Framework

**1. Acknowledge and Validate (10 seconds)**
```
"I completely understand wanting to optimize your costs, especially when you're doing significant volume. Let me be transparent about where we can and can't be flexible on pricing."
```

**2. Clarify Value Proposition (30 seconds)**
```
"Here's what might be helpful context: the reason we have volume thresholds isn't arbitrary. Our free ACH and generous feature set means we operate on thin margins for smaller accounts. We make that investment betting on network effects and AR adoption.

For your situation with $[X] annual volume, you're actually in a sweet spot for our standard pricing. Here's why..."
```

**3. Reframe with Comparison Economics (45 seconds)**
```
"Let's compare what you'd pay elsewhere:
- Bill.com: $45-75/month + per transaction fees
- QuickBooks Payments: 1% ACH fees = $[calculation] annually for your volume
- Traditional banking: $7-15 per ACH

With Nickel Plus at $35/month = $420/year, you're already saving $[amount] versus alternatives, even without a rate discount."
```

**4. Explore AR Opportunity (if applicable) (60 seconds)**
```
"Now, if you're open to testing AR, even with just a portion of your invoices, we might have a path to custom pricing. Our data shows 17% invoice payment by credit card when given the option.

If even 10% of your customers chose to pay by card, that could represent $[calculation] in processing volume. Combined with your AP spend, that potentially gets us to threshold territory.

Would you be open to a 90-day AR pilot with 5-10 of your customers?"
```

### Objection Prevention Strategies

**Pre-Discovery:**
- Qualify annual payment volume early in discovery
- Set pricing expectations before deep demo investment
- Lead with ROI calculator vs. competitor costs

**During Demo:**
- Emphasize free ACH value prominently ($X saved annually)
- Show surcharge management as revenue recovery tool
- Highlight Nickel Plus features that save time = money

**Closing Phase:**
- Provide detailed cost comparison spreadsheet
- Offer 14-day Nickel Plus trial to prove value
- If AR applicable, structure pilot with success metrics

### Escalation Criteria

**When to Involve Leadership:**
- Customer exceeds $1.5M annual volume (within 25% of threshold)
- Strategic account (accounting firm, potential 10+ referrals)
- Competitor displacement opportunity (bill.com, Melio churning)
- Willing to commit to AR pilot with measurable goals

**Information Required for Escalation:**
- Annual AP credit card spend
- Annual AR potential volume
- Current solution and pain points
- Competitive alternatives being considered
- Strategic value (referrals, case study, vertical penetration)

### Alternative Solutions

**For Sub-Threshold Customers:**

1. **Time-Based Incentive:**
   - "If you commit to 12 months of Nickel Plus and hit $X in combined AP/AR volume, we'll credit you $[amount] or provide [feature upgrade]"

2. **Referral Credits:**
   - "For each customer you refer who becomes a paid user, we'll credit you $50/month off your subscription"

3. **AR Adoption Bonus:**
   - "Enable AR for 90 days. For every invoice paid by credit card, we'll bank a $5 credit toward future custom pricing review"

4. **Tiered Growth Path:**
   - Document volume growth projection
   - Commit to pricing review when 75% of threshold reached
   - Provide quarterly volume reports to track progress

### Success Metrics

**Conversation Effectiveness:**
- Customer understands value vs. cost trade-off: Yes/No
- Customer commits to standard pricing: Yes/No
- Alternative solution accepted: Yes/No
- Follow-up scheduled: Yes/No

**Business Outcomes:**
- Conversion rate for sub-threshold prospects: Target >40%
- AR adoption rate after objection: Target >25%
- Referrals generated from converted accounts: Target 2+ per year
- Upgrade to paid tier within 90 days: Target >60%

### Key Talking Points - Quick Reference

**Why We Have Thresholds:**
- "We're already giving away industry-leading features for free. Custom pricing requires volume to offset our investment in your success."

**The Math on Standard Pricing:**
- "At $35/month, you need to be saving $36/month vs. alternatives to break even. Let me show you why you're saving $[X] monthly."

**AR as Volume Bridge:**
- "One in five invoices gets paid by card when given the option. That's found money that could get you to custom pricing territory."

**Time Value:**
- "The hours your team saves monthly with our platform vs. [competitor] is worth $[X]. Factor that into the total cost picture."

**Network Effects:**
- "Every vendor and customer you transact with via Nickel potentially becomes a referral. We reward that with credits and bonuses."
