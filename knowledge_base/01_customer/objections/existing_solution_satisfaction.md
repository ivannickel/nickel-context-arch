# Objection: Existing Solution Satisfaction (Relay Financial)

## Description

Prospect has recently adopted a competing solution (Relay Financial in this case) and expresses high satisfaction, creating a "why switch?" barrier. This objection is challenging because:
- Customer has fresh implementation investment (learning curve, setup time)
- Positive emotional attachment to new solution ("Love them")
- Recent switching costs already incurred (closed 20-year banking relationship)
- Solution is working well for current needs
- No acute pain point driving change

This represents a competitive displacement scenario requiring differentiation beyond "also good" to "meaningfully better for your specific use case."

## Customer Quotes

### Jeff Streich (Prime Renovations NY)

**Strong Endorsement of Current Solution:**
> "I'll be perfectly transparent with you. I just started using relay financial. You ever hear them?... Love them banking banking."

**Ease of Use Highlight:**
> "What I liked about them And again, I don't know that much about Nickel, but what I like about them, whenever I start a new job, I could open up a new account. On my dashboard, I can have 20 different accounts, right? So let's say I get a job, 100 Park Avenue. All I have to do, create account, 100 Park Avenue."

**Key Feature Appreciation:**
> "My favorite thing about them, I've same day ACH... I do that kind of month."

**Pricing Satisfaction:**
> "Same day's free, but I only get 10, then it goes, then it's one to one to two days. My wire transfers, five bucks."

**Cost Willingness:**
> "I just spent 90 a month with them to get the top tier thing because I thought I was getting other benefits, which I'm really not getting, but I don't even care. It's just so freaking easy. It's so easy."

**Recent Switching Investment:**
> "I literally just, no, I can't say I literally, I'm in the process of closing my TD bank that I've had for 20 years."

**Strong Emotional Language:**
> "So they really [TD Bank] why it's 15 bucks. Every outgoing why is 15. For me to do ACH through them is a nightmare... [Relay is] so, so easy. Now... It's just so freaking easy. It's so easy."

**Comparison Demonstration:**
> "So I'll give me, so this looks very similar to Relay. I'm going to show you, I'm going to share my screen."

[Proceeded to show Relay interface and explain workflow]

**Usage Pattern:**
> "See all these accounts? So I could add an account, right? So like, just for an example, I just opened this one... I mean, you go to the payees payments... ACH, I have three remaining [for same-day]. As long as they do my three. O'Clock, they'll get a 10 a month..."

## Sales Response Used

### Initial Response - Acknowledgment Without Comparison

**Non-Defensive Acknowledgment:**
> "That's the, you know, that's the goal. And if that's working really well for you, we love to hear that."

**Shift to Complementary Pain Points:**
> "Are there any challenges in terms of that invoice process when you're sending those invoices to customers via Procore? Can you kind of walk me through when they receive that? How are they paying you? What does that look like?"

**No Direct Relay Comparison Offered:**
- Rep did not compare Nickel vs. Relay features
- Did not challenge customer's satisfaction with Relay
- Did not attempt to position Nickel as replacement for Relay

### Later in Call - Noted Similarities

**When Customer Showed Relay Screen:**
> "Interesting. Yeah, it looks like there's a lot, there's some similarities here with relay in with Nickel."

**Attempted Differentiation (Weak):**
> "I think we actually would beat them on the processing time and also on the free side of it."

**No Deep Competitive Positioning:**
- Did not explore Relay limitations
- Did not ask probing questions about Relay gaps
- Did not position Nickel as superior alternative
- Focused demo on Nickel features without contrast

### Positioning Strategy Employed

**Primary Approach: Different Use Case**
- Positioned Nickel for AP/AR workflows (invoice-centric)
- Relay positioned as banking solution (account-centric)
- Suggested potential complementary usage
- Focused on Procore integration and invoice workflows

**Secondary Approach: Wait and See**
- Did not push for immediate displacement
- Emphasized trial flexibility ("trial it, test it out how you want")
- Left door open for future consideration
- Scheduled follow-up call for reassessment

## Outcome and Resolution Quality

### Jeff Streich: NEUTRAL/EXPLORATORY (Score: 5/10)

**Positive Signals:**
- Customer engaged for full 38-minute demo despite Relay satisfaction
- Expressed interest: "I kind of like it. I like the I'm trying to think, why wouldn't I do it?"
- Agreed to forward demo to CFO
- Scheduled follow-up call
- Acknowledged potential value: "I can't see not to, I mean 35 bucks a month"

**Negative Signals:**
- No commitment to adopt Nickel
- Relay not displaced or positioned as inferior
- Primary interest seems exploratory/due diligence
- No immediate pain point Nickel solves that Relay doesn't
- Strong emotional satisfaction with Relay persists

**Unclear Outcomes:**
- Uncertain if Nickel would replace Relay or complement it
- No clear delineation of which workflows go where
- Customer confusion about platform overlap
- Rep did not clarify replacement vs. coexistence strategy

**What Worked:**
- Non-confrontational approach maintained customer openness
- Focus on different use case (invoicing) vs. banking created distinct value
- Thorough demo planted seeds for future consideration
- Scheduled follow-up allows for reassessment after CFO review

**What Didn't Work:**
- No competitive differentiation clearly established
- Missed opportunity to identify Relay limitations
- Weak value proposition for switching costs (setup, learning curve)
- No urgency created
- Did not explore if Relay handles AR/invoicing well
- Processing time comparison mentioned but not developed

**Critical Gap:**
- Rep did not ask: "What does Relay do for your invoicing and AR?"
- Did not explore: "Are you using Relay for accounts payable or just banking?"
- Missed: "How does Relay integrate with Procore?"
- Never positioned: "Relay is great for banking, Nickel is purpose-built for AP/AR"

## Recommended Handling

### Discovery Questions - Competitive Intelligence

**When Customer Mentions Current Solution:**

**Don't:** Immediately compare or challenge
**Do:** Get curious and gather intelligence

```
"Relay Financial - I've heard good things about them. Tell me more about how you're using them today."

[Listen]

"That's great that it's working well. A few questions to understand your full workflow:

1. How are you handling invoicing and AR today? Is that through Relay or a different tool?

2. When you create an invoice in Procore, walk me through how the customer pays - does Relay play a role there?

3. For accounts payable, are you using Relay to send payments to vendors? How does that work with bill tracking?

4. What about the integration between Relay and QuickBooks/Procore - how's that set up?

5. Is Relay handling everything for your payment needs, or are there gaps you're filling with other tools?"
```

**Goal:** Identify where Relay ends and other tools begin. Find the gaps.

### Positioning Framework - Coexistence vs. Replacement

**Option 1: Complementary Positioning (Likely for Relay)**

```
"Here's what I'm hearing: Relay is working really well for your banking and treasury management - the multi-account setup for job-specific tracking is exactly what you need for construction.

Nickel isn't meant to replace that. We're not a banking platform.

Where Nickel fits differently:

1. **Invoicing & AR:** Purpose-built for sending invoices (from Procore/QB), collecting payments, and giving customers card/ACH choice. Does Relay handle that today?

2. **AP Workflow:** Bill tracking, approval workflows, scheduled/recurring payments to vendors. You mentioned Relay for ACH - does it integrate with your bill tracking in Procore/QuickBooks?

3. **Credit Card Surcharge Management:** Passing fees to customers, controlling rates by customer/invoice. Can Relay do that on the AR side?

Think of it this way:
- Relay: Banking and treasury (managing cash across project accounts)
- Nickel: Payment operations (invoicing, collections, vendor payments)

They solve different problems. Many customers use both."
```

**Option 2: Displacement Positioning (If Relay Gaps Identified)**

```
"I love that Relay is working well for you. Here's what I'd suggest:

Let's run a 90-day comparison test:

**Relay:** Keep using for [specific features they love]
**Nickel:** Test for [specific gaps identified - likely AR/invoicing]

After 90 days, you'll have real data on:
- Which platform saves you more time on invoicing
- Where you get paid faster (Relay ACH vs. Nickel AR with card option)
- Which has better QuickBooks/Procore integration
- Overall workflow efficiency

If Relay wins, stick with it. If Nickel proves better for the invoice/payment side, you can transition AP/AR to us and keep Relay for banking. Fair?"
```

### Competitive Differentiation - Relay vs. Nickel

**Key Differences to Explore:**

| Feature | Relay Financial | Nickel | Implication |
|---------|----------------|---------|-------------|
| **Primary Use Case** | Banking/Treasury Management | AP/AR Payment Operations | Different core strengths |
| **Account Management** | Multi-account creation for projects | Single business account | Relay wins for construction job tracking |
| **Invoicing** | Limited/No native invoicing | Full AR with email/SMS, card option | Nickel wins for collections |
| **Credit Card AR** | Unknown/Limited | 2.99% with surcharge control | Nickel wins if AR needed |
| **Bill Pay** | Basic ACH/Wire | Bill tracking, approvals, scheduling | Nickel likely stronger |
| **QuickBooks Integration** | Exists but depth unknown | Real-time sync, native integration | Nickel likely stronger |
| **Procore Integration** | Unknown | Via QuickBooks bridge | Need to explore |
| **Same-Day ACH** | 10 free/month, then fee | Unlimited on Plus plan | Comparable |
| **Wire Cost** | $5 | Not core offering | Relay wins |
| **Pricing** | $90/month (customer on top tier) | $35-45/month | Nickel cheaper |

**Differentiation Script:**

```
"Based on what you've shown me, here's how I'd contrast Relay and Nickel:

**Relay's Strength:** Banking and account management
- Creating separate accounts per job (100 Park Ave account, etc.)
- Wire transfers ($5 vs. $15 at TD Bank)
- Banking relationship replacement

**Nickel's Strength:** Payment operations
- Invoicing workflow (Procore → QuickBooks → Nickel → Customer)
- Collecting payments with card option (17% of customers choose this)
- AP workflow (bill tracking, approval, scheduled payments)
- Credit card surcharge management (pass 100% fee to customer)

**The Question:** Is Relay handling your invoicing and AR well? Or are you still using QuickBooks/Procore for that and manually tracking who's paid?"
```

### Objection Prevention Strategies

**Pre-Discovery:**
- Ask about current payment tools in qualification
- Identify recent implementations (within 6 months = harder displacement)
- Assess satisfaction level: "How's it working?" (enthusiastic = uphill battle)

**During Discovery:**
- Map full payment workflow (invoice creation → collection → reconciliation)
- Identify tool handoffs and manual steps
- Find gaps even satisfied customers don't see as problems yet

**During Demo:**
- Acknowledge current solution strengths
- Position Nickel for specific workflows, not wholesale replacement
- Use "test alongside" rather than "switch from" language

### Handling High Satisfaction

**When Customer Says "I Love [Competitor]":**

**Bad Response:**
"Well, let me show you why Nickel is better..."

**Good Response:**
```
"That's great to hear - customer love is rare in fintech, so Relay must be doing something right.

I'm not here to talk you out of something that's working. But let me ask: even with a solution you love, are there areas of your payment workflow that still feel clunky or manual?

For example:
- Chasing customers for invoice payment
- Manual reconciliation between systems
- Approval workflows for bill pay
- Integration gaps between tools

Sometimes it's not about replacing what works - it's about filling the gaps around it."
```

### The "Why Switch?" Reframe

**Addressing Switching Costs:**

```
"I hear you - you just went through a switch from TD Bank to Relay. That's fresh, and the last thing you want is another migration, right?

Here's the good news: If you decide to test Nickel, setup is about 15 minutes:
1. Link your bank account (same one you use for Relay)
2. Connect QuickBooks (one-click)
3. Import your customer list
4. Send your first invoice

You can test Nickel for AR while keeping Relay for banking. Zero conflict, zero switching cost. Just a trial to see if having both gives you better workflow than Relay alone.

After 30 days, if it's not clearly better, cancel. No harm, no foul. Fair?"
```

### Success Metrics

**Conversation Effectiveness:**
- Identified current solution and specific features customer loves: Yes/No
- Mapped full payment workflow to find gaps: Yes/No
- Positioned as complementary vs. competitive: Yes/No
- Customer agreed to trial/test: Yes/No

**Business Outcomes:**
- Conversion rate when competing with satisfied incumbent: Target >30%
- Time to trial start when incumbent present: Target <21 days
- Coexistence vs. displacement ratio: Track both paths
- Win rate vs. specific competitors (Relay, Bill.com, Melio): Track separately

### Key Talking Points - Quick Reference

**Acknowledgment:**
- "I love that [competitor] is working well. Customer love is rare in fintech."

**Gap Identification:**
- "Even with a solution you love, are there workflow gaps that still feel manual?"

**Complementary Positioning:**
- "[Competitor] for [strength], Nickel for [different strength]. They solve different problems."

**Low-Risk Test:**
- "Test Nickel alongside [competitor] for 30 days. Keep what works best, no switching cost."

**Specific Differentiators:**
- "Our strength is invoice-to-payment workflow with card options. Does [competitor] handle that?"

**Pricing Advantage:**
- "At $35/month vs. $90/month, even if you use both, you're saving money."

**Integration Depth:**
- "Our QuickBooks integration is real-time sync. How does [competitor] handle that?"
