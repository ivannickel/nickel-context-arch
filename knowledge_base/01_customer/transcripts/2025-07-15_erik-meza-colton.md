# 2025-07-15 | Erik Meza (NLT LLC) - Volume Discount Inquiry

## Summary
Erik Meza from NLT LLC contacted Nickel requesting a discounted rate for high-volume AP transactions. The conversation revealed a volume gap ($500-800K annual credit card spend vs. $2M minimum threshold) but uncovered a potential AR expansion opportunity. Erik works with Fortune 500 clients who primarily pay via ACH and demand early payment discounts. Colton positioned AR as a way to potentially reach volume thresholds while educating on 17% credit card payment adoption rate across Nickel's customer base.

**Key Outcome:** Qualified opportunity - customer will explore AR volume potential and reconnect if thresholds can be met.

## Pain Points Extracted

### 1. Insufficient AP Volume for Discount Eligibility
**Quote:** "So on the expenditure, it would be relatively when I was when I mentioned about the 50 to 100, I would say anywhere between 500,000 to maybe 800,000 annually."

**Context:** Erik's annual credit card spend ($500K-$800K) falls significantly short of Nickel's $2M minimum threshold for AP-only discount consideration, or $5-6M for pure AP volume without AR component.

**Customer Response:** Accepted the explanation, indicated willingness to explore AR to potentially meet thresholds.

**Severity:** Medium - blocking discount but not blocking product usage

**Related Patterns:** [[volume-threshold-too-high]], [[ap-only-volume-insufficient]]

---

### 2. Fortune 500 Customer Payment Term Demands
**Quote:** "I mean, I can't make any promises on that because a lot like I said, a lot of the clients are there are a lot of Fortune 500 companies, and you know how they are with even half a percent. They they they don't even want that. So they actually look for discounts. They look for 2% discounts."

**Context:** Erik's customers (Fortune 500 companies like Amazon) actively demand early payment discounts rather than accepting any fees, making credit card payment adoption challenging.

**Customer Response:** Skeptical about ability to get large customers to pay via credit card due to their negotiating power.

**Severity:** High - represents structural barrier to AR adoption with largest customers

**Related Patterns:** [[fortune-500-payment-behavior]], [[early-payment-discount-culture]]

---

### 3. Large Customer Early Payment Discount Expectations
**Quote:** "They actually look for discounts. They look for 2% discounts. So Have you been requesting that a lot? Yeah. All of them. Like, the largest ones, I mean, you you get the, the Amazons of the world, so they they are always looking for just payment term discounts so they can pay a little earlier."

**Context:** Fortune 500 customers systematically request 2% early payment discounts, creating margin pressure and cash flow challenges for vendors.

**Customer Response:** Acknowledged this as standard practice with large customers.

**Severity:** High - endemic issue affecting cash flow and margins

**Related Patterns:** [[cash-flow-pressure-from-large-customers]], [[margin-erosion-from-discounts]]

---

## Objections Raised

### 1. Volume Threshold Too High for Small Business
**Quote:** "Million. What do I get if I do meet that threshold?"

**Objection Type:** Price/Value Concern - Volume threshold seems unattainable

**Context:** Erik's $500-800K annual spend is 2.5-4x below the $2M minimum threshold for discount consideration.

**Sales Response:** Colton explained that $2M minimum requires AR component, or $5-6M for AP-only, due to generous free feature set requiring volume to justify rate reduction. Positioned AR as path to threshold.

**Outcome:** Partially resolved - customer understood rationale and agreed to explore AR volume potential.

**Resolution Quality:** Good - objection acknowledged, rationale explained, alternative path provided

**Related Patterns:** [[volume-threshold-objection-handling]], [[ap-margin-constraints]]

---

### 2. AR Customers Won't Pay By Credit Card
**Quote:** "Well, all the customers, they pay ACH, every single one of them. So we typically give Are you offering any kind of option to pay via credit card? I it's very rare, to be honest with you. Very, very rare."

**Objection Type:** Feature/Fit Concern - Belief that customers won't adopt credit card payments

**Context:** Erik assumes customers won't pay by credit card, especially Fortune 500 clients who demand discounts rather than paying fees.

**Sales Response:** Colton countered with data: "Out of the 10,000 customers that we have that use us from accounts receivable, accounts payable, or both, about, 17% of all invoices are paid via credit card." Also highlighted benefits: credit card points, 40-day float, business reasons for card usage. Emphasized automatic surcharge passing to customer.

**Outcome:** Acknowledged but unresolved - customer agreed to "keep that in mind" and "keep that option...for the customers if they wanna pay that way" but remained skeptical about Fortune 500 adoption.

**Resolution Quality:** Moderate - data-driven response planted seed, but customer not fully convinced
