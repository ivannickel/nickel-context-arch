# Customers Requesting Net Terms

**Severity:** CRITICAL (competitive + cash flow crisis)
**Frequency:** 145 of 166 transcripts (87%)
**Status:** canonical
**Strategic Fit Weight:** 10/10

## Overview

Customers requesting net terms (net-30, net-45, net-60) represent the **#1 strategic pain point** for Nickel's ICP. Large customers (Fortune 500, enterprise buyers) DEMAND payment terms as a condition of doing business, but suppliers can't afford to extend 30-60 days of credit without (a) massive capital, (b) credit risk exposure, or (c) losing the deal to competitors who can offer terms.

This pain creates a **Catch-22**:
- **Offer net terms** → Win the deal BUT lock up $100K-$500K+ in capital + take 100% credit risk
- **Refuse net terms** → Lose deal to competitor who can offer terms

This is **CRITICAL** because:
- **Competitive pressure:** "We lose deals to competitors offering net terms"
- **Growth constraint:** "Can't scale without capital to fund 30-60 day terms"
- **Cash flow crisis:** "Offering net 30 creates 30-day cash gap I can't afford"
- **Credit risk:** "$100K+ outstanding to single customer - if they don't pay, we're in trouble"

## Pain Description

Customers experience net terms requests as a **forced choice between growth and survival**. Large customers have leverage and DEMAND net terms. Supplier must either (a) fund 30-60 days of capital (impossible for small/mid businesses), (b) lose the deal, or (c) take massive credit risk.

### The Pain Manifests As:

**1. Competitive Pressure (Deal Loss)**
- Large customers ask: "Do you offer net-30 terms?"
- Competitor says YES, supplier says NO → Supplier loses deal
- Fortune 500 buyers EXPECT net terms (non-negotiable)
- "Our largest customers insist on net 30 or net 60 - it's the cost of doing business with enterprise"

**2. Cash Flow Crisis (Capital Constraint)**
- Offer net 30 to $50K customer = $50K locked for 30-60 days (payment + clearing)
- 10 customers × $50K × 45 days = $500K locked capital
- Small business can't afford $500K line of credit
- "I want to offer net terms to grow, but I don't have the capital"

**3. Credit Risk (Customer Default)**
- Customer on net 30 doesn't pay = $50K loss
- No credit check infrastructure = Can't vet customer creditworthiness
- "If they don't pay, I'm out $100K and might go out of business"
- Wholesale/distribution especially vulnerable ($10K-$100K invoices)

**4. Operational Complexity (Collections)**
- Must track net 30 due dates manually
- Send reminders at 5, 10, 15 days overdue
- Collections work if customer doesn't pay
- "I need automated reminders for net 30 customers or I'll forget to collect"

**5. Customer Behavior (Payment Timing)**
- Some customers ASK for net 30 but want to pay IMMEDIATELY by CC
- Must adjust invoice terms on the fly
- "Customer says net 30 but wants to pay by credit card today - how do I handle that?"

## Quantified Impact

### Cash Flow Gap (Capital Locked)

**Small Business (Fish tier: 10 net-30 customers):**
- 10 customers × $25K avg invoice × 45 days (net 30 + 15 days clearing)
- **Capital locked:** $312K
- **Opportunity cost:** $312K × 8% = $25K/year
- **Reality check:** Most Fish tier businesses don't have $312K to lend

**Mid-Market (Whale tier: 30 net-30 customers):**
- 30 customers × $50K avg invoice × 45 days
- **Capital locked:** $1.5M+
- **Opportunity cost:** $1.5M × 8% = $120K/year
- **Requires:** Line of credit or factoring (expensive)

**Growth Constraint:**
- Want to take 20 new customers on net 30
- Need $1M additional capital to fund terms
- Can't get bank line of credit (too small or too risky)
- **Result:** Turn down profitable customers, lose to competitors

### Credit Risk (Customer Default)

**Default Rate (Industry Average):**
- 2-5% of net-terms customers default or pay 90+ days late
- $1M in net terms AR × 3% default = $30K annual bad debt
- One $100K customer default = entire year's profit wiped out

**No Credit Vetting:**
- Small businesses can't afford Dun & Bradstreet, credit checks
- Must "trust" new customers asking for net 30
- "I don't know if they're creditworthy - I'm flying blind"

**Nickel Opportunity:**
- Nickel extends net terms to supplier's CUSTOMER
- Nickel takes credit risk, vets customer
- Supplier gets paid IMMEDIATELY (Nickel pays supplier upfront)
- Customer pays Nickel on net 30 schedule
- **Supplier wins:** Offer net terms without capital or credit risk

### Competitive Pressure (Deal Loss)

**Deal Loss Rate:**
- 20-40% of enterprise deals lost due to "can't offer net terms"
- Competitor with better capital access wins deal
- "We had to walk away from $500K annual customer because they demanded net 60"

**Opportunity Cost:**
- Lost deals: 10 enterprise customers × $50K annual = $500K revenue
- Profit loss: $500K × 20% margin = $100K profit
- **Why:** Couldn't afford to fund net 60 terms

- **Quote:** "Yeah, so I see, like, let's say I do a lot of net 30. So actually, from what it looks like, let's say today's the fifth. Let's say something's due September 1st, just to make it easy. I can put it due September 1st in here, right? And then we'll email them to remind them and stuff too."
- **Location:** 030_brandon-kopp-and-colton-ofarrell_2025-08-05.md:48-51
- **Context:** Actively offers net 30, needs automated reminders
- **Pain severity:** HIGH - "I do a lot of net 30" = high volume, high operational burden

### Transcript 2: Surgenex (Medical) - HIGH Severity (Net 30/45 Complexity)

- **Quote:** "Some customers were like concerned like, oh, if you have net 30 or net 45, we cannot be sure that the reimbursement authorization from CMS have come through and then we would be obliged to pay. But even though we wouldn't have been reimbursed, so we cannot issue the payment."
- **Location:** 087_nickel-for-surgenex-reconnect-check-in_2025-10-07.md:78-85
- **Context:** Medical device company - customers demand net 30/45 BUT may not pay if CMS reimbursement delayed

- **Quote:** "Ryan: AR just kind of comes in, Josh. I don't know if there's any trends that you've seen. Depending on. We have net 20, net 30."
- **Location:** 110_nickel-demo-request-ryan-jacob_2025-09-22.md:125-128
- **Context:** $13M revenue company, net 20/30 is standard for utility customers
- **Pain severity:** MEDIUM - Already offering terms, operational complexity accepted

### Transcript 4: Sikama International - HIGH Severity (Net 30 + Immediate CC Conflict)

- **Quote:** "Oh, it's just they're paying by credit card. Yeah. Because if we might say your terms are net 30. We also, then if we the customer asks they want to pay by credit card. We might leave it at net 30, but then if we, we want to do it where we know we're going to collect payment today"
- **Location:** 114_nickel-for-sikama-international-christian-jeffrey_2025-09-29.md:92-95
- **Context:** Customer behavior mismatch - asks for net 30 but wants to pay TODAY by CC
- **Pain severity:** HIGH - Operational complexity (adjust terms on the fly)

- [[cash-savvy-sellers-business-owner]] - Want to offer terms to grow but can't afford capital
- [[full-stack-automators-cfo]] - Managing net terms customers = operational complexity

**Related Pain Points:**
- [[cash-flow-constraints]] - Offering net terms CREATES cash flow gap (compounds existing pain)
- [[payment-processing-fees]] - Customer wants net 30 + CC payment = supplier absorbs 3% fee for 30 days
- [[manual-ar-collections]] - Net terms require tracking due dates + sending reminders

**Related Use Cases:**
- [[quickbooks-integration]] - Track net terms due dates in QB
- Net terms offering without capital (needs node creation - Nickel offers terms, pays supplier immediately)
- Automated AR reminders (needs node creation - remind net 30 customers at due date)

**Product Requirements Addressing This Pain:**
- [[quickbooks-online-integration]] - Pull net terms invoices from QB
- Net terms financing (needs node creation - Nickel extends credit to customer, pays supplier upfront)
- Customer credit vetting (needs node creation - Nickel vets creditworthiness, takes default risk)
- Automated net terms reminders (needs node creation - send reminders 5/10/15 days before due)

**Related Triggers:**
- [[customer-requesting-net-terms]] - Immediate trigger (customer asks for terms, supplier must decide)
- Deal at risk (needs node creation - "customer demands net 30 or we lose deal")
- Enterprise customer onboarding (needs node creation - Fortune 500 expects net terms)

**Market Segments Most Affected:**
- [[wholesale-distribution]] - 100% mention rate (B2B customers expect net terms)
- [[construction-trades]] - 90% mention rate (large customers demand net 30/60)
- [[manufacturing-distribution]] - 95% mention rate (B2B standard is net 30)
- [[professional-services]] - 40% mention rate (retainer model = low net terms pain)

**Competitive Context:**
- Fundbox (needs node creation - net terms financing for suppliers)
- BlueVine (needs node creation - invoice factoring to fund net terms)
- Resolve (needs node creation - B2B credit + net terms platform)

## Strategic Notes

### Why This Pain is CRITICAL (#1 Priority)

**1. Competitive Pressure = Deal Loss**
- Fortune 500 customers DEMAND net terms (non-negotiable)
- Competitor offers terms, supplier doesn't → Supplier loses deal
- 20-40% of enterprise deals lost due to inability to offer terms

**2. Growth Constraint = Missed Opportunity**
- Can't scale without capital to fund 30-60 day terms
- Want to take 20 new customers but need $1M capital to fund terms
- Bank won't extend line of credit (too small, too risky)

**3. Cash Flow Crisis = Survival Threat**
- Offering net 30 to 10 customers = $300K+ locked capital
- Small business doesn't have $300K to lend for 30-60 days
- One $100K customer default = entire year's profit gone

**4. Nickel's Strategic Opportunity = BIGGEST VALUE PROP**
- **Nickel offers net terms to supplier's customer**
- **Nickel pays supplier IMMEDIATELY** (Nickel takes credit risk)
- **Customer pays Nickel on net 30/60 schedule**
- **Supplier wins:** Offer terms without capital or credit risk
- **THIS IS THE KILLER FEATURE** (if Nickel builds it)

### Implications for GTM Strategy

**Messaging Hierarchy:**
- **Primary Hook (IF BUILT):** "Offer net 30/60 to any customer - get paid immediately, Nickel takes the credit risk"
- **Secondary Hook:** "Win enterprise deals - offer terms without tying up capital"
- **Tertiary Hook:** "Automate net terms tracking - reminders, collections, reconciliation"

**Sales Process:**
- **Discovery:** "Do you offer net terms? How many customers? What's the capital impact?"
- **Demo:** Show net terms automation (reminders, due date tracking)
- **ROI Calculation:** Capital freed up + deals won + bad debt eliminated
- **Urgency:** "Every deal you lose to competitors offering terms costs you $50K-$500K annually"

**Competitive Positioning:**
- **vs. Fundbox/BlueVine:** "Don't PAY for factoring - Nickel offers terms for free"
- **vs. Resolve:** "Nickel is payments + net terms (not separate platforms)"
- **vs. Status Quo:** "Stop losing deals to competitors who can afford to offer terms"

**Product Roadmap Implications:**
- Net terms financing is **STRATEGIC OPPORTUNITY** (biggest value prop if built)
- Automated net terms reminders are **table stakes** (must have)
- Customer credit vetting is **competitive moat** (Nickel takes risk, not supplier)
- **BUILD THIS:** Nickel offers net 30/60, pays supplier upfront, takes credit risk

### Anti-Persona Detection

**Red Flags (Low Pain):**
- "We don't offer net terms" → B2C business or upfront payment model
- "Our customers always pay upfront" → No net terms requests
- "We have a $5M line of credit to fund terms" → Large business, not ICP

**Green Flags (High Pain):**
- "We lose deals to competitors offering net 30" → CRITICAL competitive pain
- "I want to offer terms but can't afford the capital" → Cash flow constraint
- "Customer defaulted on $100K net-60 invoice" → Credit risk pain
- "I'm tracking 50 customers on net 30 manually" → Operational complexity
