# Manual AR Collections

**Severity:** HIGH
**Frequency:** 66 of 166 transcripts (40%)
**Status:** canonical
**Strategic Fit Weight:** 7/10

## Overview

Manual AR collections represent a **high-friction operational pain** for businesses managing customer payments. Owners/managers spend 10-20 hours/week manually tracking overdue invoices, sending follow-up reminders, making uncomfortable phone calls, and reconciling payments - time that could be spent growing the business.

This pain is **especially acute** for:
- **Small businesses** where owner handles collections personally
- **Construction/trades** with 20-50 customers on varying payment terms
- **Businesses offering net terms** requiring tracking of due dates + reminders

## Pain Description

Manual AR collections create **constant operational friction + stress**. Every week: check which invoices are overdue, send reminder emails, make phone calls to non-responsive customers, update spreadsheets, reconcile payments in QuickBooks.

### The Pain Manifests As:

**1. Time-Consuming Manual Tracking (10-20 hours/week)**
- Monday: Review all outstanding invoices, identify overdue
- Tuesday-Thursday: Send reminder emails (5 days overdue, 10 days overdue, 15 days)
- Friday: Call customers who haven't responded to emails
- Weekly: Update tracking spreadsheet, reconcile in QuickBooks
- **Total: 10-20 hours/week on collections work**

**2. Uncomfortable Collections Conversations**
- Must call customers to ask for payment (awkward, stressful)
- Risk damaging customer relationship with aggressive follow-up
- Anxiety about being "pushy" vs need to collect revenue
- "I hate calling customers for money, but I need to get paid"

**3. Delayed Revenue (15-30 Additional Days)**
- Without reminders: Customers forget, payment delayed 15-30 days
- With automated reminders: Customer pays on time
- **Impact:** 15-30 days additional cash flow delay
- "I would switch companies if you could help me with this kind of follow up" (Steve Goldstein)

**4. DSO Impact (Days Sales Outstanding)**
- Manual collections: DSO = 60-70 days (slow)
- Automated reminders: DSO = 40-50 days (faster)
- **Difference:** 20 days × $100K monthly revenue = $67K locked capital

## Quantified Impact

**Time Cost:**
- 15 hours/week × 50 weeks × $50/hour = **$37,500 annual cost**

**Revenue Delay:**
- 25 days additional delay × $100K monthly AR = **$83K locked capital**
- Opportunity cost: $83K × 8% = **$6,640/year**

**Total Annual Cost: $44,140**

## Strategic Notes

Automated AR reminders are **table stakes** for Nickel. Customers like Steve Goldstein explicitly state they will "switch companies" to get automated follow-up functionality.

**Nickel Solution:**
- Automated reminders at 5, 10, 15 days overdue
- Customizable reminder templates
- Real-time payment tracking
- QuickBooks sync for automatic reconciliation
