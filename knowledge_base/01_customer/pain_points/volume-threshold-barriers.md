    quote: "Unfortunately, we offer a really generous set of features, so lower rates for us are tough. And the only way we can do that is if we make up for it in terms of volume... that 800,000, in credit card spend isn't really enough to hit that threshold where we're able to make money back from it"

# Volume Threshold Barriers

**Severity:** HIGH
**Frequency:** 15 of 166 transcripts (9%)
**Status:** validated
**Strategic Fit Weight:** 7/10

## Overview

Volume threshold barriers prevent **growing mid-market businesses** from accessing lower payment processing rates or advanced features until they hit $2M+ annual credit card spend. This creates a **competitive disadvantage** where larger competitors get better rates while smaller businesses are stuck paying higher rates despite growing rapidly.

## Pain Description

### The Pain Manifests As:

**1. Can't Negotiate Rates (Below $2M Threshold)**
- Business doing $800K annual CC spend (healthy growth)
- Wants lower rate (2.8% vs 2.9%) to improve margins
- Nickel requires $2M minimum for rate negotiation
- **Result:** Can't access lower rates despite being good customer

**2. Competitive Disadvantage**
- Competitor at $2.5M spend gets 2.8% rate
- This business at $800K spend pays 2.9% rate
- **Margin difference:** 0.1% on $800K = $800/year
- "Feels unfair - we're growing fast but can't get same rates as established competitors"

**3. Feature Access Locked**
- Some advanced features tied to Plus plan OR volume threshold
- Growing business needs features but below threshold
- Must wait until hitting $2M to unlock

## Quantified Impact

**Margin Impact:**
- 0.1% rate difference Ã— $800K annual spend = **$800/year higher cost**
- At $1.5M spend (still below threshold): **$1,500/year higher cost**

**Deal Loss:**
- Can't offer competitive rates to customers (absorbing 2.9% instead of 2.8%)
- May lose deals to competitors with better rate access

## Strategic Notes

**Nickel's Position:**
- $2M threshold is FIRM - cannot negotiate below this
- Rationale: Must make up for generous free features with volume
- Alternative: Use AR + AP together to hit threshold faster

**Customer Frustration:**
- Understand rationale but still frustrating
- Want recognition for being "fast-growing" vs "too small"
