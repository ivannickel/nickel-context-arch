# Manual Cash Application

**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Frequency:** 72 of 166 transcripts (43%)
**Status:** canonical
**Strategic Fit Weight:** 6/10

## Overview

Manual cash application (matching payments to invoices in QuickBooks) is a **time-consuming data entry pain**. When payments arrive, staff must manually match payment to invoice, enter in QB, handle partial payments, investigate mismatches, and reconcile bank statements.

## Pain Description

### The Pain Manifests As:

**1. Manual Matching (5-10 hours/week)**
- Check arrives without invoice number → search by customer name + amount
- ACH arrives → match to open invoice in QuickBooks
- Partial payment → split invoice in QB, track remaining balance
- Multiple invoices paid with one check → allocate across invoices

**2. Data Entry Errors (5-10% error rate)**
- Wrong invoice selected → must reverse + correct
- Amount mismatch → investigate discrepancy
- Customer dispute → re-reconcile payment

**3. Reconciliation Lag (2-5 days)**
- Payment received Monday → entered in QB Wednesday
- 2-5 day lag = unclear AR picture for owner/CFO

## Quantified Impact

**Time Cost:**
- 7.5 hours/week × 50 weeks × $26/hour = **$9,750 annual cost**

**Error Investigation:**
- 10 errors/month × 30 min investigation = 5 hours/month
- 5 hours × 12 months × $50/hour = **$3,000/year**

**Total Annual Cost: $12,750**

## Strategic Notes

Nickel's QuickBooks integration automates cash application - payments automatically matched to invoices, zero manual data entry.
