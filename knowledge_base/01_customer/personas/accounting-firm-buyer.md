   - Needs proper accountant firm view with dropdown client selection
   - Quote: "I thought you said separate logins and that would be a deal killer"

4. **Check Fraud and Payment Security**

   - Pressure to move clients to electronic payments for security
   - Quote: "There's no question that with all the check washing that's going on out there, that an electronic payment is by far the safest method"
