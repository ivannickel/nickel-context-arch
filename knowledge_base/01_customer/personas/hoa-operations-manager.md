## Pain Points

### Primary Pain Points
1. **Excessive Payment Processing Fees**

   - $3.95 per ACH transaction fee
   - With 2,500 residents, fees multiply quickly
   - Quote: "They charge almost 4% on credit cards and then $3.95 per ACH"
   - Board wants to reduce costs passed to residents

2. **Limited Payment Flexibility**
   - Current system doesn't support flexible payment schedules
   - Residents want to budget throughout year (monthly, weekly options)
   - "Pay as you go" model not available in current platform
   - Quote: "We're wanting to get them to where if they want to, they can pay us $1,200 a month or $100 a month"

3. **Manual Check Processing**
   - Still receiving checks in mail from residents
   - Office staff must manually handle check deposits
   - "Old school" residents resistant to change
   - Quote: "We do get some, you know, old school checks in the mail"

4. **Multi-Channel Invoice Delivery Requirements**
   - Bylaws mandate mailed invoices (cost and effort)
   - Also send email invoices (duplication)
   - Need third option (website portal) for convenience
   - Cannot eliminate any existing channel

5. **Resident Access and Convenience**
   - Want residents to "just go click, hey, go click payments and be done with it"
   - Need 24/7 self-service payment option
   - Simplify experience to reduce calls and questions
   - Quote: "I really think that if we could get it to where it's a no call, that that would probably even stop the checks from coming in"

### Secondary Pain Points
- Large-scale data migration (2,500 resident records)
- Email/mailing address management for residents
- Board approval process for new vendor
- Training residents on new payment options

   - Worry about time-intensive manual data entry
   - Need for clean CSV import process

2. **Recurring Payment Setup Requirements**
   - Free plan doesn't include recurring payments
   - "Leading into that, because more than likely we're going to want the Plus option"

   - Need comprehensive information package
   - Timeline dependent on board meeting schedule

4. **Resident Adoption Concerns**
   - "Old school" residents still prefer checks
   - Will residents actually use new portal?
   - Need to maintain all existing payment channels
   - Change management with 2,500 households

5. **Integration with TOPS Accounting**
   - No native integration with TOPS platform
   - Would require CSV-based workflows
   - Potential double-entry if reconciliation isn't smooth
   - Quote: "Do we have to be on...I can't think of the platform...Do you have to be with QuickBooks?"
