## Foundation Validation

**ICP Definition Validation:**

- **Transcript evidence:** 8 accounting firm conversations (4.8% of corpus)
- **Validation:** **NEEDS VALIDATION** - hypothesis requires proof of multiplier effect

**Strategic Implication:** Small sample size (8 transcripts) requires deeper investigation. Validate:
1. Are accounting firms actually managing multiple client payments?
2. What is actual client multiplier (50? 100? 150+)?
3. Conversion rate vs. standard business customers?
