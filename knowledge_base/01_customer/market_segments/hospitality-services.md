### Revenue Tier Breakdown

| Tier | Count | Percentage | Strategic Fit |
|------|-------|------------|---------------|
| Whale ($5-25M) | 3 | 50.0% | High (9/10) |

## ICP Fit Analysis

**Segment Fit Analysis:**
1. NON-ICP fit indicates limited alignment with core ICP criteria
2. Revenue distribution: 1 Fish, 3 Whale, 0 Kraken
3. AR-dominant profile shows payment needs exist but may not align with revenue model
4. Strategic fit weight (3/10) = low priority

**Strategic Fit Assessment:** **LOW**

**Segment Prioritization:** NON-ICP - deprioritize unless exceptional firmographic fit (e.g., Whale/Kraken with AR focus).

## Foundation Validation

**ICP Definition Validation:**
- **Foundation assumption:** Hospitality & Events is non-ICP (anti-persona or low fit)
- **Transcript evidence:** 6 transcripts (3.6% of corpus) - should be minimal
- **Validation:** **CONTRADICTS** if 3.6% > 10% OR **CONFIRMS** if 3.6% < 10%

**Strategic Implication:** Low corpus percentage confirms proper ICP filtering. Maintain current qualification standards.

## Strategic Notes

**Key Insights:**
- Hospitality & Events represents 3.6% of sales conversations
- AR-dominant indicates payment workflow patterns
- Strategic importance: 3/10

**Recommendations:**
1. Review lead qualification to reduce non-ICP pipeline leakage
2. Deprioritize unless Whale/Kraken tier with exceptional fit
3. Consider pass-through to self-serve onboarding
4. Monitor for false negatives (good fits misclassified as non-ICP)
