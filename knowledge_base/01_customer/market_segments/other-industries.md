## ICP Fit Analysis

**Segment Fit Analysis:**
1. MIXED fit indicates limited alignment with core ICP criteria
2. Revenue distribution: 6 Fish, 4 Whale, 0 Kraken
3. Balanced (both AR & AP) profile shows payment needs exist but may not align with revenue model
4. Strategic fit weight (4/10) = low priority

**Strategic Fit Assessment:** **LOW**

**Segment Prioritization:** NON-ICP - deprioritize unless exceptional firmographic fit (e.g., Whale/Kraken with AR focus).

## Foundation Validation

**ICP Definition Validation:**
- **Foundation assumption:** Other Industries requires case-by-case evaluation
- **Transcript evidence:** 38 transcripts (22.9% of corpus)
- **Validation:** **PARTIALLY VALIDATED** - significant presence indicates market pull

**Strategic Implication:** Consider upgrading segment priority if conversion rates justify. Monitor Whale/Kraken performance in this segment.
