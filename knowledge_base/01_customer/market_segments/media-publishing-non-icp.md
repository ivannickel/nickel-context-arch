## Firmographic Distribution

### Revenue Tier Breakdown

| Tier | Count | Percentage | Strategic Fit |
|------|-------|------------|---------------|
| Whale ($5-25M) | 1 | 100.0% | High (9/10) |
| Kraken ($25M+) | 0 | 0.0% | High (8/10) |
| Fish ($1-5M) | 0 | 0.0% | Medium (6/10) |
| Shrimp (<$1M) | 0 | 0.0% | Low (3/10) |
| Unknown | 0 | 0.0% | TBD (4/10) |

## ICP Fit Analysis

**Segment Fit Analysis:**
1. NON-ICP fit indicates limited alignment with core ICP criteria
2. Revenue distribution: 0 Fish, 1 Whale, 0 Kraken
3. Balanced (both AR & AP) profile shows payment needs exist but may not align with revenue model
4. Strategic fit weight (2/10) = low priority

**Strategic Fit Assessment:** **LOW**

**Segment Prioritization:** NON-ICP - deprioritize unless exceptional firmographic fit (e.g., Whale/Kraken with AR focus).

## Foundation Validation

**ICP Definition Validation:**
- **Foundation assumption:** Media & Publishing (Non-ICP) is non-ICP (anti-persona or low fit)
- **Transcript evidence:** 1 transcripts (0.6% of corpus) - should be minimal
- **Validation:** **CONTRADICTS** if 0.6% > 10% OR **CONFIRMS** if 0.6% < 10%

**Strategic Implication:** Low corpus percentage confirms proper ICP filtering. Maintain current qualification standards.

## Strategic Notes

**Key Insights:**
- Media & Publishing (Non-ICP) represents 0.6% of sales conversations
- Balanced (both AR & AP) indicates payment workflow patterns
- Strategic importance: 2/10

**Recommendations:**
1. Review lead qualification to reduce non-ICP pipeline leakage
2. Deprioritize unless Whale/Kraken tier with exceptional fit
3. Consider pass-through to self-serve onboarding
4. Monitor for false negatives (good fits misclassified as non-ICP)
