Colton O'Farrell: Hey, Christian.
Christian Sheerer: What's up, Colton? How are you?
Colton O'Farrell: Doing really well on this end.
Christian Sheerer: How about yourself? Cool. Doing well myself. Yeah. Might rely on you still for the demo portion, but just gonna get a feel for
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah. Whatever you need. I'm I'm here to support you, so just let me know. Cool. Cool. Yeah. We didn't get
Christian Sheerer: it confirmed, so we'll see.
Colton O'Farrell: And while you're kinda going through this as well, I'm just going through updating the qualifying details, MEDDPIC, all of that stuff. So if you if I seem distracted for a moment or something, just that's why. And you can let me know, and I'll zoom back in. But trying to get all these updated before I start doing some more outbounding.
Christian Sheerer: Oh, yeah.
Colton O'Farrell: One question. I was curious too while we're waiting for, Patricia to join. So, when I when I'm putting everything in now for Bant, I'm just doing, like, b, like, the budget, little line, and then I'm down, like, authority, down, need. Instead of, like, putting it all in one, which I'm fine doing, but do you think there's any like, instead of, like, having that broken up where it's, like, budget is one field, authority is one field, need is one field in timeline, or do you think that's kind of redundant? The only reason I ask is because when I No.
Christian Sheerer: No. You're right. It might be it might be better. Yeah. Same to, like, that would just be, a we just would have to play around with, like, how it would sit on the page. Like, that might be a separate card, you know, rather than qualifying details and all of them in there.
Colton O'Farrell: Mhmm. Yeah. Cool. I just wanted to that was one thing I kinda noticed as I was going through and updating. But, otherwise, yeah, it's a nice process, and you guys did a great job with it. So I really appreciate that.
Christian Sheerer: Bye. Thanks.
Colton O'Farrell: Also, what typically, I do on these calls is I will call them on, like, minute three if they don't join. Yep. So and a lot of times, I find people have trouble joining Zoom or didn't get the invite for whatever reason. They generally answer because they're expecting some kind of a call. So Mhmm.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. I'll give her a call in a second. Cool. No answer. Mailbox full. I say we give her one more minute, and then we just call it.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah. What I usually do in that scenario is I will still just, like, leave the I'll turn off, like, my camera. Also, leave the Zoom up just in case they join.
Christian Sheerer: But Yeah. Yeah. That's the job. Usually I mean, like, for a twenty minute call, like, five minute grace period, I think, is more than enough.
Colton O'Farrell: A 100%. But I will say I've had a number of people that join, like, ten minutes late or something or, like, you'll call people and they're like like, hey. Are you ready for, like, our demo call? And they're like, hey. I'll be on in, five minutes, and it's already five or ten minutes late. I'm like, sorry. I have other calls I gotta do. So either, like, yap on now or we gotta reschedule. I can't wait.
Christian Sheerer: So I think that's a good, yeah, that's a good framework. Like, five a fourth of the call being done. Right? Like Mhmm. Yeah. If it was thirty minutes, maybe give her, like, seven minutes. But
Colton O'Farrell: What I was thinking too, because you guys have called out this before that the twenty minute maybe isn't, good enough for a lot of these, or, like, it's some enough time for some of these. For other customers, it's plenty of time. But what I was thinking is keeping the twenty minutes. But what I'm typically doing if I'm expecting to need more time is I'm just, like, putting a hold on my calendar. And, like, the Zoom will at least go for forty minutes total, but, that's how I so at least if it's a an opportunity or inbound that's not, like, of a ton of interest to us, we're not, like, being super bogged down with our time. Like, we have that out. But if we need additional time, we can have that, and we can let the the person know. But I had a call yesterday or two days ago that, like, the guy was like, do you think we'll have enough time? And I was like, I'm just gonna put a hold here in case we go over. Generally, the 20 minutes is plenty of time, but so that's also potential strategy too. Does that make sense? No. I don't follow. So keeping, like, the twenty minute booking period. So if it's, like, an accountant coming in, they have a very basic use case, but maybe they're talking a lot instead of occupying, like, a thirty minute time slot or more. Like, it could be twenty minutes or less. But say we have one of these bigger companies or wholesale distributors, like, we're gonna wanna do more discovery. There's gonna be, like, more time necessary. We still have it at the twenty minute when they book, but you just put, like, a hold right after that time on your calendar so nobody can book it with you. And the Zoom will not end in twenty minutes.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. No. I hear you. I think the only issue is, like, they're gonna expect it to be twenty minutes because it's twenty minutes on their calendar. Because we
Colton O'Farrell: can always we can always send a a little note saying, like, the meeting is, set for twenty minutes, but I I'm putting a hold here if we need to go longer. Generally, twenty minutes is enough time. But Yeah. You know, for your particular case, we we might have some need some additional time. So if that's okay with you, I also have that, but the meeting invite will just say, like, twenty minutes. Okay. Just like the automated aspect.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. No. I hear you. Another solve for that is, like, it's a little bit longer, like, a thirty minute block on the calendar, and then we get on. And it's like, hey. We might not need all the thirty minutes, and we wrap up early. And we're like, hey. I'm gonna give you your time. Think we're good. And then if we need to go, we we can continue to go, and then we have that thirty minutes. So then you're just, like, gauging on the call whether or not you need to, like, cut it short or or or or use the full block. I think, like, people rarely read those little notes in the thing, which is evidenced by the fact that they sometimes can't find the Zoom. You know? Right. And so, like, I no. I mean, maybe I'm just an anecdote that is not reflective of the general hold, but, you know, I see, oh, twenty minutes on my call on my calendar. Like, I'm banking out twenty minutes for this. And I assume, like, most people in, like, you know, executive role.
Colton O'Farrell: We also also come from, like, software and, like, tech space. And, like, the ways that we operate, I mean, we're not necessarily working with a lot of those types of folks. And I have definitely noticed, at least on the construction material side of things and some of these ICP clients, like, they do not operate the same way as a lot of these tech people. So while those things that seem obvious to us, I don't necessarily think know if it's obvious to a lot of the ideal client profiles or target buyers that we're going after is my only call out there. But I do agree with you.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. I know. Yeah. Yeah. Of course. Yeah. I mean, we'll see. All these things are work in progress.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah. Cool. Chris Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: Let's go.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah. Okay. I was just gonna say that. Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: This is this is dead. Patricia.
Colton O'Farrell: Okay. What I what I do, though, is I do make a note anytime even if they're a no show just to, like, have that. So, yeah, that's my only recommendation is you just mentioned that. You no show. You tried calling. Didn't answer. You can shoot her a message letting her know. Like, hey. Sorry we missed you. If you wanna reschedule, we can. That sort of thing, which I'm sure you obviously know. But
Christian Sheerer: Nah. Not a good note. Yeah. Cool. Where do you put it usually on the on just, like, the meeting in in HubSpot? Or
Colton O'Farrell: I have just been putting it in the notes section, so I keep it the same as before. I just like, my same for formula where I have the date, type, length, discovery channel use case, like, those same kind of points that I'm calling out. Like, I just keep it all in the same format usually, but it just says, like, no show at the top and my outreach to them.
Christian Sheerer: But Cool. Cool. Alright. No
Colton O'Farrell: doubt. I'll chat with you later, Christian.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. We'll see I'll see you very soon. Cool.
Colton O'Farrell: Thank
Christian Sheerer: you for hopping on.
