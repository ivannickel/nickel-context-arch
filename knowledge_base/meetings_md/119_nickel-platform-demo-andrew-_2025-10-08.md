Jacob Greenberg: Sam. Hey, Andrew, can you hear me okay?
Andrew Collins: Yep, I can hear you.
Jacob Greenberg: Awesome. How's it going?
Andrew Collins: It's going well. How are you?
Jacob Greenberg: Good, good. I think Zach. You spoke with Zach pretty recently. He might be joining our call any moment. He might just leave it up to us, but. Okay, I have, I have half an hour on the calendar for us today. Does that work for you still?
Andrew Collins: Yeah, I'm hoping it doesn't take that long, but let's see where it goes.
Jacob Greenberg: Sounds good. So I know that you had a decent conversation with Zach. I got some of the high level stuff. Typically the way I start these calls just to understand a little bit more about how your current operations are for AR Nap, what your current tech stack is. This way I could customize the demo specifically to you guys. I don't show you any information that isn't relevant and we can save some time at the end for any questions or talk about implementation, stuff like that. So that sounds like a good agenda.
Andrew Collins: Yeah, so. So from what I understood is that you guys have a way where I can send my homeowner a way to do ACH payment. That's easier than them going to their own financial institution accidentally doing a bill paycheck instead of sending the ach. And you don't charge anything for the service.
Jacob Greenberg: That's correct. That is kind of nuts and bolts of what we do. Yep.
Andrew Collins: Okay. Yeah, I'd love to see more.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. So right now when you go to collect payments from customers, you're pretty much having them pay you however they prefer. They're like using Zelle or other payment methods.
Andrew Collins: We prefer Zelle. Majority of our payments are paper checks from homeowners. We're a service company and we take a few credit cards. We're pretty happy with our current credit card processing system. And then for some people, they insist on sending a wire or an ach, and for that we just give them our banking info and then it's up to them. Some homeowners do better with it than others, and I'm hoping that this can help out the ones that struggle.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, awesome. And then you said you prefer Zelle out of all those other options. Can you walk me through why?
Andrew Collins: Because it's quick, it has no fees, and most everyone has the ability to do it. A lot of our transactions are smaller and it's, you know, basically just anything to avoid a credit card.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. When you say your transactions are smaller, what is the typical size of your transaction?
Andrew Collins: So there would be like two brackets, like service stuff would be any. I'D say average service transaction would be around 500 bucks, and then for larger payments or average larger payment size would be around 7,000.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, and in any given month, what is the typical amount you guys are processing through sell credit card AC8, all the above.
Andrew Collins: Typical month, save 450,000.
Jacob Greenberg: And just one last question before I hop into it, and I'll give you some background about nickel, and then I'll show you our platform for accounts payable. Are you guys also using Zelle? Is that your preferred method when you're making bill payments, or do you guys use check? Do you have a preferred method to use for bill payment?
Andrew Collins: Usually credit card, just to give us extra time on it. We're whatever platinum preferred level with our bank. And so we get a lot of cash back on it, and a lot of times the credit card processing fee we get hit with is like 3%, and then our cash back is like 2.75. So for a quarter of a percent, we can have longer terms on it.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, great. Sounds good. And then when you're making those payments, are you just like, typing in the credit card information? How are you guys tracking that? We have a accounting system. I know you're not using QuickBooks, but do you have, like, a general ledger software that you use?
Andrew Collins: So we do use QuickBooks, but we have an accountant that goes over that stuff with us. We don't make payments through it because of the fees. Yeah, ap. It's. It's. However, however our vendor wants to get paid.
Jacob Greenberg: We.
Andrew Collins: We make it happen.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. Okay, cool. And then on your reconciliation side, when you are doing Zelle or you're waiting for checks, occasionally you'll do credit cards. Sometimes people will wire. You guys are taking that information manually, entering it into QuickBooks, or you're just downloading, like, your banking statements and sending that to your accountant, and then they'll immediately update it. How does that process work?
Andrew Collins: So there QuickBooks is linked with our bank account, so all that stuff automatically imports. And then the accountant goes over it. But then we individually go through and appoint them to the jobs in our CRM.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. And it seems with like an average size of 500 or $7,000, but you're doing around 450k a month. That's a pretty sizable amount of individual transactions. How much time is it taking you to, like, on a monthly basis, go through and assign all these payments directly to the invoices?
Andrew Collins: Not very long.
Jacob Greenberg: Like less than one day.
Andrew Collins: It's. I mean, we, we do it as they come in. It's not like we're going through and like searching for them. It's like, all right, like we're, we're very hands on with receiving payments. And then for the credit cards, you know, we just automatically run those when we're complete.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, perfect. All right, great. So I think that we are probably going to be really good fit for you guys. It's super easy and lightweight to implement. And like Zach was saying, if you're doing transactions under $25,000 per transaction, it's free to get started and free to use. There's a couple features like scheduling payments in advance that you unlock with just $35 a month. But if you wanted to, you guys can upgrade at any point. So today I'm going to show you some of the features related to Nickel Core, which is our free platform to get going. Let me open up my demo environment here. And you guys, you said you do occasionally accept credit cards. It's a small percentage of what you do because you don't want to incur those fees. So you're kind of encouraging people to do Zelle, etc. What do you use at the moment for credit card processing?
Andrew Collins: Use virtual terminal.
Jacob Greenberg: And those rates are what, like 2%.
Andrew Collins: 3% low to mid twos, depending on what the card actually is and how much information we give the system. All of our transactions are card not present, but if we give it a zip code and a name and we get a match on those, the percentage gets a little lower.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, great. And would you say that's like, what, 10% of what you're getting paid in a month? Less than that?
Andrew Collins: Yeah, roughly, probably 10%.
Jacob Greenberg: So if it is 10% and you are paying just 2% on each of those transactions, you're still incurring roughly 900 a piece. So I think that we're going to be able to like make your life way easier, show you what this looks like, provide a better customer experience for your customers, and at the very least, save you guys 900amonth or 10 grand a year. So let's pop into it.
Andrew Collins: Yeah, the, the people that are paying by credit card, they're only paying by credit card because they, yeah, all, all other measures that we tried to get them not to do that have failed. And.
Jacob Greenberg: Right. That, that's understandable. And you know, I know. So like, you guys are seeking cash flow advantage by paying with credit card. Occasionally, customers prefer that cash flow advantage as well. We've realized that in this industry. So I'll take a step back actually. Nickel was founded by Our CEO who used to be the director of innovation at Stake, Black and Decker. So he's very familiar with like the built world industries, contracting, construction, service industries. And that's where his inspiration of three mental came from. Ideally, the goal here was to create better cash flow advantages for these businesses. And what we realized is these companies are accepting multiple different types of card payments or multiple different types of payments, excuse me, ach wire credit card, figuring out different ways to do it. It's not automatically connected to the invoicing structure that they have in QuickBooks or their accounting system. Sometimes checks sit around in a truck for a while. It's hard to collect payments and it creates a cash flow disadvantage for these businesses. The goal was to create a hyper affordable, hyper simple way to provide your customer one singular place to pay. However they prefer to pay without it incurring any fees or time delays for the business. That's our North Star, that's what we do. So I'll walk you through how we do that really quick. This is inside the nickel platform. This is just, you'll see here on the left hand navigations panel, there's four tabs. This is just the summary tab of your recent transactions. This is your transaction tab of all the transactions that you guys have done. So you can really think of nickel as your cash flow management system. Your accounting system will be QuickBooks or whatever you guys use. This is where you guys will see all the cash flow coming in or going out. If you wanted to use it for bill pay, you're not required to use AP and architecture, get paid and bill pay. A lot of our customers just use accounts receivable solutions in nickel. A lot of them just use accounts payable, but you have the ability to do both with whatever platform you sign up for. So from the transactions tab, get to be able to see all of your transactions, whether they're receivables or payables, where it's coming from, going to the invoice number or purpose statement and the status of those transactions. For today, I'm going to really focus on the get paid section on invoicing because this seems to be where a lot of the complexity in your system is. I know you guys have it down to its feet for the most part, but we're definitely going to be able to make it a little more consolidated and a little easier. So when you sync with QuickBooks, the first thing you do when you set up nickel is you go into account settings. You'll update your branding so your company logo and any image you want for your banner and then you go to Integrations and click link quickbooks. Depending on how much data you have in your QuickBooks when you connect it the first time, it might take five to six minutes to fully update, but after that it's an instantaneous two way sync. So every invoice that's generated from within QuickBooks will automatically populate within Nickel to be sent out. And anything that's paid within Nickel or generated from within Nickel is automatically updated to the corresponding invoice in QuickBooks right away.
Andrew Collins: So that's something else we don't do. We don't generate or send invoices through QuickBooks. Everything runs through our CRM.
Jacob Greenberg: Even better. So is your CRM connected to QuickBooks?
Andrew Collins: No.
Jacob Greenberg: And you're generating the invoices from the CRM?
Andrew Collins: Yes.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. So in this case, you can continue to generate the invoices from the CRM. You have a couple different ways you can do this. It's totally up to you to send out the payment. I'll walk you through creating an invoice within Nickel and some people. Well, there's two different options you guys can do here. Once you create an invoice in Nickel generates a link unique to that invoice for payment, some people who use Nickel will take that link and put it into the invoice from their CRM and send that out. If you have the ability to send it from the CRM. Inversely, some people will generate like the line item PDF and they'll attach it to the portal invoice inside network. I'll show you what I mean by that.
Andrew Collins: Okay, I have a quick question on that. That link and that that's something that I can also text people and send in like personal emails as well.
Jacob Greenberg: Absolutely. I'll show you how easy it is to do that. Okay, so I'm just going to create a new customer here. I'll do Go Gulf Coast Aluminum as a demo. I'm going to put my email address associated with this so that you can see what it looks like to receive an email. Do you guys use invoice numbers or purpose statements?
Andrew Collins: These invoice numbers.
Jacob Greenberg: So I'll put a dummy invoice number here, an invoice amount. You can do a one time invoice or a recurring invoice. If you ever want to do referring invoices to customers. For you guys, it's pretty much just one off invoices, right?
Andrew Collins: Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: So you set the invoice date and the due date. If you got. Do you guys do net terms on your payments?
Andrew Collins: No. Yeah, basically everything's due when we request it. We'll do so doing construction, we'll have permitted projects. So we'll do like a small percentage to do the permit paperwork and then we do a draw before we show up to prep materials and then we do the remaining at the end. But we don't, you know, send these people scheduled invoices. We just send them when we're ready.
Jacob Greenberg: And when you do the draw, are you like collecting their payment information in advance and auto charging, auto debiting their account or are you just requesting a deposit?
Andrew Collins: No, because of how we prefer checks and them to send achs. Like I can't just. I can't withdraw money with their banking information.
Jacob Greenberg: So it is an option to do that in nickel. Is that something you want me to show you or is that not something you'd want to attempt?
Andrew Collins: Is it free or. Because I really don't have a problem getting paid on this kind of stuff.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, it comes with a free platform. It's just up to you.
Andrew Collins: And also when I'm doing the draws, those are like my $7,000 average transactions. I could see someone getting upset. I could see, you know, also bouncing bounces on that insufficient funds. Like when we just run the credit cards, they're really small amounts, so it's usually not an issue on that end.
Jacob Greenberg: Totally fair. So if you want to see that at the end, let me know. If not, I'll just go through the typical workflow. So invoice date is the date you're creating the invoice. You can set the due date for the same day because it's you're requesting the same day. You put any notes for the customer can go here and then this is where you'll update. I have a sample invoice on my computer and for some reason it's the hardest thing for me to find every time I do a demo. But you can upload any attachments here.
Andrew Collins: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: So you can put any attachments here. This is typically where people will attach like a line item detailed downloadable PDF invoice. But you could also do like photos of the job site if you do have netterms agreements, met terms agreements, any contracts you might have with them, any PDFs that you're sharing back and forth with your customer can be stored on this individual customized payment portal for them to consolidate communications in one central place. And they'll always have access to it on the advanced section here. I'm just going to toggle this feature on which allows customers to edit the payment amount. This is also used in multiple different ways up to your preference. Sometimes people who request deposits in the beginning of a job and the balance at the end of the job will enable the customers to be able to edit the payment amount. So they'll send the invoice in the beginning, they'll edit it, pay 200 or the deposit, and then they'll pay the rest at the end. Some people send out two invoices. This also just gives the customer the ability that, hey, if you have a $7,000 job, they could pay the same invoice, half in credit card, half in ach. It doesn't affect you negatively whatsoever. Just a cash flow advantage for them.
Andrew Collins: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: Customized. You can turn it on and off. It's up to you.
Andrew Collins: Okay, so since I think you said you didn't have a PDF invoice ready to go, can I send you one and then you can use that? All right, let's do that.
Jacob Greenberg: You have my email, correct?
Andrew Collins: Let me double check. They could. Yeah, I gotcha.
Jacob Greenberg: This is actually also helpful because I could show how you can edit invoices even after they've been created.
Andrew Collins: And then if you could text it to me too, I'd like to see how that comes through on a mobile device.
Jacob Greenberg: Awesome. Yeah, sounds good.
Andrew Collins: All right, Just sent that to you.
Jacob Greenberg: Perfect. Andrew, where are you located?
Andrew Collins: Southwest Florida, Bonita Springs.
Jacob Greenberg: Very cool.
Andrew Collins: Yeah, it takes a while. Our emails have a really long like. Are you sure you wanted to send that timer on it? There we go.
Jacob Greenberg: Invoice. And here's your phone number. So this is the invoice that we created. You'll see that it's populated inactive because I haven't sent it out and it hasn't been paid. And you'll see there's a request payment button right here. So if I wanted to send it right now, I would just go ahead and click send. One neat thing also is you could filter for all unsent invoices and you can send them all out at the same time by selecting them. So I could send like 10, 20, however many invoices simultaneously, if that's interesting. But to edit the invoice, I just click into it. I'll click edit and I can change any information about the invoice itself. Or I could come in here and I'm going to upload. Just going to drag this from my desktop. There we go. Add that assessment there, go to the get paid section to edit where I'm going to be sending this. And I'm adding your phone number right here.
Andrew Collins: Oh cool.
Jacob Greenberg: Here's the charge payment method on file button in case you wanted to see it. Here you can add your customer payment information on your own or you could actually send a link to them to be able to request they upload their information in a secure way. This way you guys no longer. Right now you guys are dealing with manually managing all your customers financial information. If you are doing this request and you're sharing your information out and it comes with PCI compliance issues. So we handle all PCI for you. We handle soft to compliance. I'm going to click send on this invoice and the payment link has been sent.
Andrew Collins: Okay. Oh, and how long does that the payment information stay in the system?
Jacob Greenberg: As long as we want it to. Okay. You have complete control of that.
Andrew Collins: I got the text.
Jacob Greenberg: And this is what the email will look like here.
Andrew Collins: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: So it'll have this again. This will be, you know, degrade distribution is our demo account that we have in our system. So this would be Gulfstream and you'll be able to have your own logo here. Branding. There's also a link so you could click on this. It'll go straight to your website, which is pretty nice.
Andrew Collins: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: And I'll have all the information here and any of the PDFs will be attached to the email as well as to the payment portal link. So if I go ahead and click Pay now it will open up this link. That PDF is right here. If I click on it, I'll download it again. It has the total information in the invoice number again, your branding and your logo. Any notes you want regarding this project can go here. This could be full paragraphs or just one quick sentence or nothing at all. They'll have the due date for the payment and the total amount. You'll see that they have the option to pay by bank for free with no fees. Or they could choose to pay by card and incur the 2.99% fee themselves. So the idea here is that we're giving them the option to pay however they want. They see that it's an updated fee. If they do decide to pay by card, they'll take the 2.9%. If they decide to pay by bank, it's completely free. We find that with this. Yep, go for it.
Andrew Collins: Can I remove the pay by card option?
Jacob Greenberg: To remove pay by card? That would cost $35 for a plus. Okay, but you're really giving the option to pay however they prefer. What we find is about 22% of the time in the industries that we're serving, which is your industry, service and construction and contracting. Customers of nickel users do 22% of the time elect to pay by card because it provides them the same cash flow advantage that you were talking about before. Plus a lot of people already have cash back cards, etc. The other cool thing here is they could change the amount. So if they wanted to pay half now or just half in card and half in bank, they could view that also. Well, once they pay, that's pretty much it. It's very straightforward. We've had previous transactions with this customer. Their previous billing transaction and their other invoices will populate on the same page below here so they can see all the transactions that they've had with you guys. So if you did send out one for deposit, you label it deposit and then this is the balance. They'll be able to see both the deposit and the balance if it's been paid or be able to make both payments and it's that easy. Once it's been paid, the invoice will move from active to completed. You'll be able to see that it's marked as paid. You'll see the total amount and the amount that's been paid. And for ar it's really that simple. There's a couple other easter eggs that I'd love to show show you, but that's the nuts and bolts of the operation there. Just creating a unified synced branded experience for your customers to choose to pay however they prefer. We also actually I don't have it in my demo environment, but we just came out with Apple Pay for this. So if you do get it on mobile, someone can just do the double tap on their phone and pay via Apple Pay.
Andrew Collins: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: So far I know I just showed you like the high level basics. Does this seem like it's fitting for you guys? Is this kind of up your wheelhouse? What are your thoughts?
Andrew Collins: It, it might be when we do run credit cards for those small things, we don't hit our homeowners with the fee. And then for, and then for the big ones we don't even allow credit card payments. And that's kind of status quo for industry so we don't really get any pushback on that. But if you guys are allow them.
Jacob Greenberg: I understand not passing the fees. So why don't you allow them?
Andrew Collins: We just don't like having to deal with it. It's. It's not that hard for us to get a paper check or. Yeah, or an A.C. sometimes it's hard to get ach, that's why I'm talking to you guys. But it's just kind of an industry thing and we just don't like charging the fees. But if you guys take it from them here and it's transparent like this, it's maybe not so bad.
Jacob Greenberg: You also have a couple other options. If you do the plus version, you're able to disable credit card payments by just toggling this on. If you stick with Core, what you're able to do is customize the fees on this payment. So you can decide how Much of this 2.99 is shared with the customer or with you. So if you want to split it equally, just come in here and type 50%. Save it. And the invoice link should be updated and it's now 1.5% instead of 3.
Andrew Collins: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: Customer pays 0%. Save it. New invoice link. No fees required or bank. But here are the one payments.
Andrew Collins: Okay, and then so 35 bucks, is that a month to remove the option?
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, let me show you the pricing page real quick. Okay, so this, there's Nickel Core, which is the free version and Nickel plus which is the paid version. Nickel plus, if you're doing it on a month to month, it's $45 a month. If you're doing it all upfront annually, it comes out to be $35. Now that's it. It's very straightforward and very basic. You get some other benefits with Nickel plus you get one day quicker turnaround times for ach. So two day business turnaround time for ACH with Nickel plus as opposed to three day encore. Encore credit card payments will take two days to turn around on plus it'll be the next day on Nickel plus you can have as many different unique logins to your Nickel account as possible as you want. So if you had all of your accountants, they could log into Nickel to track all the transactions. And once again, all these transactions will automatically be posted into your account view in pressbooks and be connected with the invoices. So it might save them a little bit of time. I save you a little bit of time as well. Give you more transparency over also removes the transaction limit. That's not really a problem for you guys. It enables you guys to schedule payments in advance. If you do bill pay, you could set up hey, I want to make this payment for next month on this date. Set it in advance, it'll auto withdraw. You could also do recurring payments. So a couple other features that come with Nickel plus so it seems like this could at least be an easy alternative that is branded to accepting Zelle and could reduce the credit card fees. Maybe not the whole 900 if you want to share fees. So it has the potential to save you guys some money as well. Do you see how this might save you guys time and for the ach and credit card.
Andrew Collins: Yeah, yeah. If anything, I'd probably be leaning towards doing the plus on a. On a month to month and then. And then just removing the credit card info to. To keep it tidy for us when we get payments through this. Does it go into like our. Do we have a nickel bank account and then we have to transfer that to our bank of America account or does it go straight into bank of America?
Jacob Greenberg: It goes straight into bank of America. We'll sync directly with your bank account. It goes straight. There we are. Because a lot of customers have requested that we have like nickel cash and like trade credit options. We're developing a product for that so that if you wanted to, you could keep it in there. But right now that's not how it works. It just goes straight to your bank account. All we are is the whole, like I said before, like, the origination of nickel is about creating better cash flow for our users and their customers. So in the future we do hope to add on products. They're all going to be optional, of course, but with the design and intent to improve cash flow. So trade credit is one of them. Better net terms agreements is one of them. Those are just some products on the roadmap. Okay.
Andrew Collins: Yeah, no, this is, this is cool. I like how you can get that payment link. It's something that I have to go to ownership with to see if we're actually going to implement it. But I like what you've shown me.
Jacob Greenberg: Awesome. What does that process look like? So it would be one owner or a couple different people weighing in to make that decision.
Andrew Collins: Right now it's just. Just one guy.
Jacob Greenberg: What's his name? Just so I have reference, his name is Tom. Awesome. Well, I'm more than happy to do another demo with both you and Tom and we can talk about pros and cons and what it would look like to roll it out. And if you guys do decide to do nickel plus, which it seems like that's where you're leaning, even if it's just at 35 or 45amonth. If you do that, we'll set you up. I'll hand you off to a customer success manager for your account specifically, so that as you guys go forward he could help you create a rollout plan, help you do test transactions if you want to offer any onboarding and support for anybody on your team. So if you're going to be managing the AR or if your accountants are going to be coming in and doing some activities or Tom himself is going to see some stuff, we'll offer onboarding plans, demos, trainings, the likes for whoever needs that resource.
Andrew Collins: Okay, yeah, yeah, we'd probably just have two users on this. We're not a huge company but. But yeah, multiple users would be a nice thing.
Jacob Greenberg: What do you think the next step could be here should typically and I'll just let you know, what we typically end up doing is I'll set a follow up meeting where we could do a demo, part demo and part like login implementation or whoever else is going to be part of the decision making process so we can talk through it. And the cool thing with this is even if you do go for plus during that next call, we can just sign you guys up for core because it's free so that we can help you through the onboarding process. And when you're ready on your own at any time, just pop in the settings and upgrade.
Andrew Collins: Okay. Yeah, I liked all the follow up emails I got from you guys. I'm pretty good at that too. I'll set a snooze on one of our emails and I'll get back to you guys after I talk to ownership. It's just tough right now because we're going through a bit of a downturn right now. So anytime we're spending more money isn't great. But I think that this might help us easily collect some payments. And we have a lot of GC partners that request separate invoices and the way our CRM invoices, it only sends the invoice as a balance remaining, not a partial payment. So I have to send a big email explaining like yeah, you only have to pay 10%, 50% right now. So I like this.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. Yeah, that's great. Okay, cool. We'll hold off on all the follow up emails. I can send you a recap of today and that's it. But as far as timeline goes, I know you need to talk to your manager or to the owner. What timeline should I be expecting so that I can put this on my, on my project?
Andrew Collins: I'd say within a week.
Jacob Greenberg: Within a week. Okay, great. Would it be fair for me to touch back in then within like two, two and a half weeks with you?
Andrew Collins: Yeah, that's fine.
Jacob Greenberg: I'm gonna throw a reminder on the calendar for us to sync. Then you can feel free to add whoever you want to add to it or to change the date if you need to. Just let me know. I get. My calendar just gets really booked and busy, so. So I just want to make sure that I don't forget about it. Okay. So two and a half weeks would be Friday the 24th. I can send out an invite for the same time as we did today. Does that sound all right?
Andrew Collins: I'm actually not going to be in that day, so you can make it for the 23rd if possible.
Jacob Greenberg: All right, I will do that. All right, great. My only request would be to go ahead and confirm the invite when I send it out. This way I don't get double booked for that time.
Andrew Collins: Okay, I'll. I'll click on it this time.
Jacob Greenberg: Awesome. I appreciate it. All right, Andrew, it was great to talk and I'll catch up with you soon. Let me know if you need any, like, information or collateral or one pagers or anything like that, where you have your conversation with Tom. I can get it together and send it to you.
Andrew Collins: Okay. Yeah, just send me a recap of this and. And hopefully we'll make it happen.
Jacob Greenberg: Sounds good. All right, great talking to you, Andrew.
Andrew Collins: All right, thanks a lot, Jacob.
