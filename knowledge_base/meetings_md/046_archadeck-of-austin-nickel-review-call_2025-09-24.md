Colton O'Farrell: The other note taker.
Jim Schallon: I'll.
Colton O'Farrell: We have our old one and then the new one we're testing, but yeah, we're still early, so no worries for Tim.
Jim Schallon: Okay. Okay. So I will be utilizing nickel today for the, you know, for either today or tomorrow for the first time. So. So maybe you could take me through the steps on this again. The website again is. Let me get in here real quick.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep. You can just go to our main page, which is getnickel.com when you do that here. I can.
Jim Schallon: Yeah. I've got it saved, I've got it bookmarked. So. Perfect. So I'm gonna pop in. So the name the email is going to be basically mining, is that correct? Yes.
Colton O'Farrell: So for your account.
Jim Schallon: Look here.
Colton O'Farrell: Members.
Jim Schallon: Yep.
Colton O'Farrell: It should just be your email address.
Jim Schallon: I think I've already done a password. Yeah, there it is. Okay. All right, so I'm, I'm already in here. I've. I've got myself set up with the account settings and I'm going to share just. Yes, please. So you can see what I've got going here.
Colton O'Farrell: Awesome.
Jim Schallon: Okay, so now you know, if I want to put a customer in here, I would go to get paid. Is that how I do this?
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah. Well, this is. This would pull in some of your customers that you've already grabbed from QuickBooks. So if you click customers, you'll see all the customers that we've grabbed. So it looks like there's about 26 of them in here. Okay, so we are. With that integration you have set up. So if you go to your account settings, you'll see the integration is set up under QuickBooks. So you can continue to create customers in QuickBooks. We'll automatically pull them in here for your customers. Are you. I remember from our last call, you guys aren't sending out any invoices from QuickBooks, it's just generating the invoice.
Jim Schallon: Well, basically what I'm doing is I'm, I'm just sending them. I. I'm going to send a client to this to do an ach transaction and then what they'll do is they'll know how much their deposit or their start payment is going to be and then, you know, we'll just put it in there. So when we create an invoice, that's basically saying to the client, this is how much you need to bill to. To this account.
Colton O'Farrell: Correct? Yep.
Jim Schallon: So once. Okay. So none of these, none of these clients are, Are mine. So let's say I want to put a new customer in. So I click over here. Yeah, I don't not going to have anything in QuickBooks so if you don't.
Colton O'Farrell: Want it, you don't want this customer to be synced into quickbook.
Jim Schallon: Because, well, they're going to pay before I have anything in QuickBooks for them. So they're going to be making a payment for a deposit and I'm not going to have an account set up here for, for QuickBooks for them because.
Colton O'Farrell: In that case you'll want to turn this QuickBooks sync often if you're adding a customer and they're not going to be that they're not in QuickBooks or you don't want them to be in QuickBooks, that information will flow there. You would want to turn that automation off for this, for adding this particular customer. If you don't want that information to populate into QuickBooks, it will solely be a nickel here.
Jim Schallon: Okay, so, so I've turned, you see, I've. I've taken sync off, so I'll save that.
Colton O'Farrell: Oh, so you. So now if you just start typing the name of the customer you want to add, it's going to ask for the name of the customer and then their email and then when you hit save, it's going to save them as a customer and you click. Yep, add. Just click that add button there and then put in their email address.
Jim Schallon: When will this.
Colton O'Farrell: So they're not going to get an email from you until you send an invoice, by the way. So adding them as a customer in here, you just add their name email. There's going to be nothing on their end. It's going to be. Once you send the invoice, this is just where it will go. Okay, so we'll save that. And real quick, before we actually generate an invoice, let's pop back into your account settings and we want to add, let's add a branded logo here just so they know who it's coming from. We do for the, the branding and the logo there it is ideally a square design and that's like one by one. If you don't have that, I'm happy to help rework your logo so that it fits kind of the parameters. Sometimes I'll throw them into like ChatGPT or like Canva if you don't have a easily accessible one. But I would recommend adding some kind of logo in there before you send an invoice.
Jim Schallon: Turn that off. What I need to do is set this logo in here.
Colton O'Farrell: You can ignore those annotation marks. Just was trying to drag the screen Back up.
Jim Schallon: Okay. Yeah, no, I'm just struggling here to put any kind of logo in. I don't have it. I tried to snip the one that I have on my email and it's.
Colton O'Farrell: Not popping in there.
Jim Schallon: Well, let me. Let me snip it from the email and see what happens here.
Colton O'Farrell: So otherwise I can always go to your website here and just grab. I see some options for some potential screenshots of. That would just work.
Jim Schallon: Just do that. Just. Just go ahead and do that.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, let's do that then.
Jim Schallon: Quick.
Colton O'Farrell: I'm just going to grab this white one that says Archadeck of Austin and I can actually upload that for you.
Jim Schallon: Okay, let's see that.
Colton O'Farrell: One more time. Sorry, it was just the one letter off of Archie Deck was not showing up on there. So I just gotta make it.
Jim Schallon: Okay.
Colton O'Farrell: Slightly smaller here, but I. We'll get that uploaded here in just a moment.
Jim Schallon: It.
Colton O'Farrell: All right, we got one that fits. If you want to refresh your page, you'll see that like I said, this one will just be a placeholder till we get a better logo for you guys.
Jim Schallon: Okay, that's fine. Yeah. Cool.
Colton O'Farrell: So now let's go to the. And this. The. The banner is more for the payment portal which it doesn't sound like you need right away, but if you have something readily available, we can add that. That's just specifically for that payment portal where customers can come in and input any amount. So this wouldn't be tied to the invoices we're sending.
Jim Schallon: Yeah, I'm not. I'm. I really don't care about it. Tim and those guys want to do something with a banner. They can do that. So.
Colton O'Farrell: Sounds good.
Jim Schallon: Yes.
Colton O'Farrell: Well now let's pop back over to the get paid tab on the left. Okay. Yep. Oh, sorry. If you want to click it one more time, you might have to select the actual invoice. Okay. Now we can go to new invoice here section.
Jim Schallon: Okay.
Colton O'Farrell: And then you would just start typing in Kurt or Curtis.
Jim Schallon: Is.
Colton O'Farrell: So this will want to. And this is something you always want to make sure. So the QuickBooks sync again. We'll want to turn that off since we don't want that to populate back into QuickBooks. Give it an invoice number or name then for you can have. Is this a recurring for like the one kind of large project they're going to pay 30% each time or something like that?
Jim Schallon: Yes. Okay. Yeah, I don't have the amount yet to. I haven't determined exactly how I'm going to set up as payments but what I wanted is learn how to set this up as a new customer. So when I I'm ready to for him to make his deposit, he can, I can send this to him by, you know, and, and then he can get it done. So. Cool.
Colton O'Farrell: So yeah, I mean we want to. We could turn this either as a one time. We could have it be recurring if you want it. If it's going to be more of a static amount. If you wanted to do that for those three payments that are like 30 each. Because then we can, we can schedule it every month to go out. We could do quarters, we could do weeks, whatever kind of cadence you want.
Jim Schallon: And we won't be scheduling on a cadence. We will be on an as needed basis. So we will have to go in and automatically we'll have to send another link to the client so that they can make their deposit or their start payment or their progress payment and then their final payment.
Colton O'Farrell: Gotcha. That makes sense. Cool. Wanted to call out. Yeah. So it's just you go to the invoice, you generate that you can create the invoice before sending it to the customer. So also if you wanted to play around with this, we could always add myself as like a customer on your end. So you could practice by sending invoices to me. Can show you kind of what that looked like. But if you wanted to just test out new things before actually sending to a customer. Happy to add myself in there too for you. So I'll go ahead and do that now for you new customer. Turn off the quickbook sync.
Jim Schallon: What is your name?
Colton O'Farrell: Colton. I've actually I've just added myself as a customer into your account now. So if you refresh or you refresh and just type in Colton, it'll say Colton at nickel. You might need to reef. Oh, there it is at the bottom.
Jim Schallon: Cool.
Colton O'Farrell: So feel free to send me any kind of invoices. So when you go to generate a new invoice, you can just type in Colton this the payment method on file. That's more would be for me to fill out. But if for generating invoices and seeing what that looks like for your customers, you can go ahead and send me anything.
Jim Schallon: It won't let me input anything.
Colton O'Farrell: You want to try some of the other two fields before you go to that one. It might be and this is more so you don't have to put in a category if you don't want. You could always just create an invoice specific amount. So let's Click out of the. Let's just click into somewhere in the white here and let's go to invoices on this side and then new invoice here. Then you can type my name.
Jim Schallon: Perfect.
Colton O'Farrell: And if actually you hit this advance button as well, you'll see what additional features you have essentially. So you're currently in the free plan. So this button here would allow the customer to make a partial payment. So if you want to be able to allow that, you would turn that on. This box here is for that the global surcharge rate. So if I were to pay with a credit card, I would pay 100% of that cost. If you want to change this for me or for a customer specifically you, you can just enter in what that rate you'd like if you'd like it. 50, 50. If you enter in zero, that means I would pay nothing. You guys would eat the cost. But that's some control you have on the free plan. If you also upgrade to the nickel. Plus you also have the ability to turn on or turn off credit card payments as well. But you can go back to the overview now just make sure this is turned off because we don't want me in your QuickBooks. And you can enter any kind of amount, the invoice name or number, put a memo and I can show you what that looks like.
Jim Schallon: Now why would I upload a document here?
Colton O'Farrell: In case you want to upload like a PDF attachment. If you have like a paper invoice or you have just some kind of attachments or documents that you would want to accompany that invoice, that's what you would attach there. But it's not necessary required. Just throw in an invoice number or purpose. You just say test you'd like, hit create. And so it's created, it's sitting. Actually you want to go ahead and click in the white somewhere here for now just to show you that the invoice has not been sent yet. Or you can click the close button so the invoice has been generated. It's just sitting here. Like if you wanted to do this for Curt, for example, the way to send it off is to go to the far right where it says request payment, click that button. It's going to bring you back to that screen we just closed out of. Basically what we're going to do is we're going to send this hyperlink right here via email because that's what's inputted there. But once you hit that send link button, I'm going to get that Email immediately. And if you were curious of what that link looked like or would look like going to your customer, you could always copy the this here and open it in a new tab before sending. Some of our customers do that just to check in advance.
Jim Schallon: But.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, go ahead and hit that send link button. I'll pull up. Yeah, you can paste that link into a new tab. And I already got the email, so this is what I'll see if I hit the pay now button. So if you want to stop sharing just for a moment, go ahead and share my screen. This is the email that I just got that you just generated. So it says, archadeck of Austin, you have a new payment request, dollar deposit test. If there was an attachment, it would be right here. If I hit that pay now button, I'm going to be brought to that same screen you had just a moment ago. So if I want to pay by card, pay by ach with my bank. But that's what it looks like on the accounts receivable side.
Jim Schallon: Got it. Okay. So pretty straightforward.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah. You weren't cc'd on this communication. So if you want to go ahead and share your screen one more time, I'm going to show you just a couple things in the notification setting that you might want turned on. So if you go to account settings.
Jim Schallon: Down.
Colton O'Farrell: Right there, go to notifications.
Jim Schallon: And.
Colton O'Farrell: Then go ahead and click all three of these arrows to open those up further. So these are some when you'll get an email notification essentially of something occurring within nickel. So I'd scroll a little bit. Okay, so this last one right here, contact email, Set a specific email address to CC when a payment link is sent out. So if you want to be CC'd on the invoices going out in case your customer replies to those, for example, you would want to just add your contact email there to be the one who cc'd on that communication.
Jim Schallon: Okay. Yeah, I'll let. I'll let Tim do all the saves on this. So cool. Yeah.
Colton O'Farrell: And if it's something you don't care about, some people don't want to be cc'd. They get too many emails. You can always just keep that off. But something that potentially could be helpful for you guys.
Jim Schallon: Okay. All right, sounds good. So once I go to here now I have customer notifications. Okay. And bill pays. That wouldn't be something I would be doing either. So. Yep.
Colton O'Farrell: It's more so on that. That first or the last box on that first section.
Jim Schallon: Y. Let me open this door. It is freezing cold in this room.
Colton O'Farrell: Oh yeah, don't hear that in summertime in Texas.
Jim Schallon: Yeah, it's, it's either way too cold or it's way too hot.
Colton O'Farrell: So yeah, I'm originally from South Dakota so that sounds very familiar for me. And also in Chicago we have very similar weather. It's either. I, I've looked at those charts before where they compare like cities in the US with how many quote unquote nice days they get in Chicago. Only gets like 50 of them a year, so. But it's mostly wind related which we can handle, so.
Jim Schallon: Cool.
Colton O'Farrell: Well Jim, any other questions you have for me? It sounds like you got a pretty good handle on walking through the accounts receivable side. I did want to also mention as well, if you scroll up quickly, you do have a lot of the functionality kind of dialed back because of the current plan we're on. So if you click this plans tab there. Just wanted to call out when you guys are ready as well. We do give a 14 day free trial of the Nickel plus, but that's going to basically enable more functionality for you, speed up processing. It's going to raise the invoice limit from that $25,000 to just under a million dollars per transaction, which is probably more than you guys will be needing. But we do basically turn on all of the features, bump up the advancements and then there's no charge or hidden transactions. When it comes to like ach. The only way you would pay more than this is if you're eating that credit card charge or if you're paying bills with a credit card.
Jim Schallon: Yeah. And we're probably going to be doing the nickel plus.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah. Based on the invoice sizes and some of the, the setups that you guys were looking for, I would recommend the plus as well.
Jim Schallon: We'll be, we'll app. Yeah, absolutely. We'll be doing the nickel plus. Cool.
Colton O'Farrell: I know we talked a little bit about the referral link. Any questions? Kind of on that side that, that's again in that box there.
Jim Schallon: No, I don't. Again, I, I, I will defer to Tim on any decisions about referrals and, and you know, sending you guys any, any business.
Colton O'Farrell: No worries. Yeah. Well, just wanted to again call that out for you. It is available something that, it's unlimited as well. Get two of those. It pays for nickel plus for an entire year.
Jim Schallon: Yep. I'm sure he'll want to, he'll, he'll want to do it. He'll, he'll want to refer somebody, you.
Colton O'Farrell: Know, especially, I mean we, I think you guys are the 15th or so architect brand that we're working with now. Seems like it's a great fit for a lot of those groups. And if there's. I know with the Empower brands, they got other.
Jim Schallon: Yeah.
Colton O'Farrell: Franchise like logos. Brands underneath them too. I'm sure you guys are all in connection. Might be a pretty easy, like, pitch there for you and get a little money in your guys's pocket, so.
Jim Schallon: Okay, sounds good. Cool.
Colton O'Farrell: Well, appreciate your time, Jim. If anything comes up, let me know. But yeah, you just gotta adjust that logo there. If you have problems when it comes to any of the. The transactions invoices, just go ahead, hit that help center button. It will prompt you to send a message to our team. It will go to the engineering team, the support team, customer success, and we'll hop on that immediately. Can always contact myself, but if you're looking for, like, a really quick turnaround time, I might be in meetings most of the day, so I would recommend that. But looking forward to supporting you guys. And yeah, you can think of me as kind of your strategic partner here at Nickel. My role is really to understand your objectives and help you achieve those and make sure you're having a great time with us.
Jim Schallon: So. Sounds good. All right, well, thank you for the education and I will get.
Colton O'Farrell: My pleasure.
Jim Schallon: Yeah, I'll be using this very shortly, so.
Colton O'Farrell: Sounds great. I'll keep an eye on things.
Jim Schallon: All right, Colton. Bye.
Colton O'Farrell: Bye.
Jim Schallon: Bye.
