Jim Lisi: Oh, there we go. Now I can see your black file cabinet. I can't see you. Now I see nothing. Hey Christian, can you hear me?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, how's it going?
Jim Lisi: Okay, good.
Christian Sheerer: I can hear you just fine. I could also hear Marti, but like you were saying.
Jim Lisi: I just hung up on it. We were talking on the phone before the call.
Christian Sheerer: Oh, oh, oh, awesome, awesome.
Jim Lisi: So yeah, I don't know where she's at exactly. This is the, she's not proficient in web meetings and stuff.
Christian Sheerer: That's fine. I mean, as long as she, we don't necessarily, Not that we wouldn't want to see you, Marti, but we don't necessarily need to have the camera. As long as you can see us and hear me and Jim, then I think that's sufficient.
Jim Lisi: Are you good, Marty? I don't think so. I'll call her.
Christian Sheerer: It might be connection, so I'm just turning on my camera briefly to help with the bandwidth.
Jim Lisi: So we're not hearing you or seeing you.
Participant 2: Oh.
Jim Lisi: Hold up, Bob.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, there might be just. Sorry, there might be a little mute thing in the bottom Marty, if you can hear us. And then I think you unmuted yourself. So if you want to try speaking, we might be able to hear you.
Jim Lisi: Worst case, I can put you on the phone. So if you can't get this to work, we'll just do it on the phone. Because you're on mute or something, we can't figure you out. Are you there?
Participant 2: I'm here.
Jim Lisi: Okay, we're getting the echo back. Do you want to close your window? Because it's working somehow, but we're. There you go. All right, there you go. So we've got you through my phone. Okay. See, that's you.
Participant 2: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: Okay.
Jim Lisi: So, yeah, I opened the account, but I didn't. I just got the routing numbers and account numbers. We haven't activated anything yet. So that's where we're at. Marty is our treasurer and will be the first user. And then we'll bring on the other side, our foundation. Probably in a month because I know the guide is running. Our foundation is out of town through the 18th of September.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, thanks. All right, well, Marty, you tell me what would be the most useful thing for you to understand with us and whether or not we want Jim to click around with it or I can show you stuff on my fake environment or answer any questions that you have. I think that might be a useful place to start.
Participant 2: Well, why don't we start? Jim just told me what we were gonna do. What do you do? What's your, do you have a company? Is this a company that?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So, Nicole is the company. We're financial technology platform. So fancy way of saying we help move money. And what we're focused on is moving money fast for cheap, and with little effort and having to think through it super hard on our customers' end. We were built for industrial businesses. That's sort of how we got our start, is thinking through materials suppliers, builders, construction, people who sell tools for construction, who handle large payments. But want to do so fastly, securely, and cheaply. And so we started out with them, but then have expanded and anybody who moves money and receives money, accounts receivable, or makes payments out to vendors, accounts payable, we can help with free ACH and pretty low credit card transaction fees. And so what we do is give one place to handle all money going in and out and connect back up into your ERP, whatever that may be, which is your accounting software. So that's the short bit on us. We've been around for about three years. 10,000 companies roughly use Nickel and we're growing. So I think people will hear more and more about us. And yeah, company, I joined from a much larger company. I was excited about it. I've been doing software for about three years and been here for about a couple months now. So yeah, that's the small just that's the elevator pitch.
Jim Lisi: I'm 10% of your tenure at the company, I think.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, yeah, exactly.
Participant 2: Okay. We have a lunch meeting and somebody comes to me and we said, we wanna, we have, we wanna charge this $35.
Jim Lisi: So let's back up a little bit. So, okay, we're a club and one of the things we do is every quarter we invoice our members. So we're looking for ways to take payment there. And then the second scenario is twice a month we meet. So we have guests that come to the meeting and we wanna, pay their admittance fee if they're not a member at the door. So those are the two use cases that Marty is most concerned about. And then the third one is taking donations. And our first major fundraiser is October 4th, what we're trying to get ready for.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, awesome. Well, recurring payments happen very simply through the platform. You can send an invoice. Everything happens with a payment link. So you create a customer in the platform, store their information, and then you can send them a payment link via email that they can recurrently pay out against if it is every quarter, or you can send them a one-time payment link. So for those people who are signing up at the door, I would send them a one-time payment link for that admission fee.
Jim Lisi: Right?
Christian Sheerer: It's like a deposit to be a member of the club. Send them that. And then once they're in, you'll collect their information and be able to send them a recurring quarterly payment, which they'll pay out against. And then we'll be able to track all those payments in your Nickel account so that you can see which customers, or not necessarily customers, but which club members, we call them customers, the people that are paying you. Have paid for the quarter, which have not, which have overdue payments or outstanding balances. So you have one place to track all those.
Participant 2: So you have to send them your link first before we get anything?
Christian Sheerer: You'll send them a link through the platform.
Jim Lisi: Yep. So instead of logging on to QuickBooks, QuickBooks will be integrated into Nickel, correct?
Christian Sheerer: Correct.
Jim Lisi: So that we can grab the invoice and send it to the member. And then for a guest coming in, we're going to need to sign them up somehow, right? We would just take their email address and send them a link for an invoice. We have to create the QuickBooks invoice. How does that look?
Christian Sheerer: So Marty, can you see my screen at all? Can you see me? I'm waving right now, actually.
Participant 2: No, I completely got out because there was an echo. Could I sign back in?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, totally up to you. I've demonstrated it for Jim a little bit, so I just want to make sure that you can see it so it's relevant for you.
Participant 2: I can't see it now. Gosh.
Jim Lisi: No.
Participant 2: You'Re.
Jim Lisi: Good.
Participant 2: Wait a minute. No, no, I can't get in. Oh, join here.
Jim Lisi: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: Still, can you see me?
Participant 2: Okay, go ahead.
Jim Lisi: I don't know where your camera is, but it's like going through your hair.
Christian Sheerer: It might be on your ear.
Participant 2: I have no idea where my camera is.
Jim Lisi: Do you have a headphone on? A headpiece in an earpiece?
Participant 2: No.
Jim Lisi: Can you see me okay?
Participant 2: Wait a minute. Thank you. You know where my camera is? I'm not asking.
Jim Lisi: You don't have to. What you can do is just mute yourself and listen to the phone. Okay.
Participant 2: Let's see that. Okay.
Jim Lisi: There you go. Perfect. I should get rid of the echo.
Participant 2: Okay.
Jim Lisi: Cool.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, can you see me okay?
Participant 2: Yes.
Christian Sheerer: Awesome. So if I'm sending out an invoice, here's how I'll do it. I'll share my screen one sec. Cool. So if I'm sending out an invoice, I'll go here, hit new invoice in the top, and I'll go to a customer that I have saved, and I'll say, Hey, this is for admission. Maybe 500 or whatever it is. What a due date is and then I'll create a link and I'll send it out to them and then they'll be able to pay that on that link. So I've sent myself a link.
Participant 2: As.
Christian Sheerer: A customer and I'll go and see, okay, here we have a new request and then I can pay by card or by my bank account. And they'll see the other unpaid invoices that I have when they've been due. If they're overdue, it'll be in red. When I pay it out, I'll see all the ones that are completed. So this is now you seeing all your members paying out. And in what amount?
Participant 2: That they have to pay this through a credit card?
Jim Lisi: No.
Christian Sheerer: Credit card or by their bank? ACH.
Jim Lisi: ACH.
Participant 2: Okay.
Jim Lisi: But it's kind of a mixed use case here. So that $500 bill is somebody who'd be in our system. And we do this every quarter. Yep.
Christian Sheerer: So you can set up a recurring one.
Jim Lisi: The person that comes to the meeting is likely not in our system. We need to start further back for that person.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, somebody who's not in the system will create a new customer. So I'll create Christian as a new customer. I'll type in their email address. New member.
Jim Lisi: Now we could say just here's a better just to keep it clean for us. Say September 3rd meeting.
Christian Sheerer: There you go. Make the due date whatever date you want.
Jim Lisi: Yep.
Christian Sheerer: Make it the third. Whatever, just not in the past. And then write a note.
Jim Lisi: And so then you put the 35 in.
Christian Sheerer: Yep, create it. And then you'll send it out to them.
Jim Lisi: And then they can pay it then or they can pay it later. We just got to trust them to pay.
Christian Sheerer: And you can always send them reminders if they haven't paid.
Participant 2: How do you integrate QuickBooks invoicing?
Christian Sheerer: So if you're making your, so you'll go into account settings and you'll go to integrations. All you'll have to do is click this link and log into QuickBooks and it'll be synced up.
Jim Lisi: So if you create an invoice on nickel, will it backward integrate into QuickBooks?
Christian Sheerer: Yep.
Jim Lisi: And then the ones that are in QuickBooks will forward integrate to be sent through nickel.
Christian Sheerer: Exactly. It'll go both ways.
Jim Lisi: Okay.
Participant 2: Here's another question. Is there something in the And voice that you can say we're using nickel.
Jim Lisi: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: So they'll see it as a nickel payments. They'll see it as rotary, sorry, Santa Barbara.
Jim Lisi: Yeah, Santa Barbara North.
Christian Sheerer: Santa Barbara North dot nickel payments.com you can put your logo here. And you can put, you know, this is coming from Jim or Marti email. And so they'll know very clearly that they're paying it through Nickel, which they'll know. And then they're paying you with your logo here. So you can go into your settings and sorry, in general, you can put your branding, upload your logo in a banner.
Jim Lisi: I'll do that stuff, Marty.
Participant 2: What was that?
Jim Lisi: I'll do that. I'll stumble up. Put the logos in and the names and get it all going. I guess.
Participant 2: I'd have to see it work.
Jim Lisi: Yeah, I'm sure we're gonna have to play with it. That's how you learn. That's how I learned is by doing not by watching as much.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, any other, I mean, it's pretty simple to get set up. It usually takes about like an hour and a half. Are there any other questions that would be useful for me to kind of field for you, Marty?
Participant 2: Did you say something to me?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, just while we have each other on the line, are there any other questions that would be useful for me to answer for you live? Because I can pay vendors through Nickel, you can receive payments, you can set up a payments portal, Jim, like we talked about, if you want them to just have a static place to come without sending them an invoice. But I can help answer any questions that were top of mind for you.
Participant 2: I would have to see it.
Jim Lisi: You.
Participant 2: Know, start off with an invoice and then go from there before I have any questions.
Jim Lisi: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: And we can handle it that way, too. We can run some transactions in between now and then ahead of October 4th, you said, is when the next meeting is.
Jim Lisi: No, next meeting is the 10th.
Christian Sheerer: The 10th of October.
Jim Lisi: Yeah. No, September. Oh.
Christian Sheerer: Oh, sorry. But you. You had a goal of setting this in place before October something, right?
Jim Lisi: October 4th is our fundraiser, so I need to get our code set up and I gotta print. So in the next two weeks or so, I need to be printing stuff with QR code, so. People can get there on their phones. Okay, yeah.
Christian Sheerer: And so that might be a good next step for us, Marty, is if we're running invoices on that September 10th meeting, where then after that we can come together and help troubleshoot any things that have come up in your playing around with it. But the goal of today was just to make sure you were generally comfortable. So if there's any other questions that I can help answer To make that happen, you know, we still got the time.
Participant 2: When Jim was talking about our Octoberfest, that means that we can take a...
Jim Lisi: We can bring a laptop to the entry and do the same thing there.
Participant 2: Okay.
Jim Lisi: Create an invoice for every person, send them a link and have them pay right there at the festival. Yeah.
Participant 2: You know one thing about Mulligans where we meet every two weeks?
Jim Lisi: Yeah.
Participant 2: Their internet is horrible.
Jim Lisi: We might want to use a hot spot. Christian can't help us with it.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, I would if I could.
Jim Lisi: But maybe we could go to the sign on and just go through that because I. I started it and we now have the routing number and account number and we can get paid and launch. We got money in the bank, right?
Participant 2: Shall we have a few dollars?
Jim Lisi: Yeah. Sorry.
Participant 2: See what my problem is.
Jim Lisi: Well, I could share screen and go on from mine.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, I got about seven minutes until I have to hop. Okay, so.
Jim Lisi: All right, let me see if I can get on here. Which one did I use? Password. Well, I gotta go look this stuff up. Give me a second. All right, logging in. We'll go connect the bank account. Let me share screen here. You don't want that? There's screen. We can select window or screen. I thought I said. All right, we'll just go. Screen one. I go to here. What does that look like to you guys? Same?
Christian Sheerer: I'm not seeing it yet.
Jim Lisi: Yeah, I'm trying to share the tab.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, maybe just the window that that tab is on.
Jim Lisi: Right, that's what I was thinking. Wow. You know it's giving me everything. What if I go right to here? Does that change it for you?
Christian Sheerer: No, now I can see it.
Jim Lisi: Okay, so I can't, but you can. That's good. All right, so Connect Bank account is where I'm at.
Participant 2: Can you let me in again? Oh, somebody's helping me now. Well, we're gonna run out of time, that's all.
Jim Lisi: Nicholas uses Plaid to payment method. What phone number? I don't know.
Christian Sheerer: That'll just be your phone number. Yeah, that'll just be the phone number that you'll. That is connected to either the bank account or something that'll help you do multi-factor authentication.
Jim Lisi: Let's do mine since I can handle it. Okay.
Participant 2: This is on the camp. This is on the telephone. Okay. Ridiculous.
Jim Lisi: We're Montecito Bank and Trust. There we go. Oh. And do you have login credentials, Marty, to get into Monticello Bank of Trust?
Participant 2: You know, I'm so new to this.
Jim Lisi: No. I need.
Participant 2: I need to go over there, Jim, and sign up for.
Jim Lisi: Okay, that's fine. I'm gonna stop sharing here. I'm gonna let say we're gonna let Christian go. Yeah, it should be super simple. Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: I mean, I I I can't really help with putting in the bank account information, but once that's set up, Then if there's anything that I need to help troubleshoot in sending out those first couple of invoices and connecting into QuickBooks, I'm happy to hop on ad hoc call in between now and then. Or if we want to set up time for after the 10th, after you've had some time to play around with it.
Jim Lisi: Okay, I think I'll just work on getting it signed up with Marti in between the two of us. We got to get all the information to the one point. So. Okay, cool. Well, thank you, Christian.
Christian Sheerer: Well, yeah, no problem. Any other questions before I let you all go?
Jim Lisi: I had Marty turned down for. She said no. Thanks for your help. Okay, cool.
Christian Sheerer: Tell her I said thank you as well. I'll see you, Marty. All right, Jim.
Jim Lisi: Take care.
