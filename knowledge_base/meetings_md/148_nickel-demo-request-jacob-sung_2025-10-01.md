Jacob Greenberg: Hello? Hey, Jacob, can you hear me?
Jacob Sung: Yes, I can. Can you hear me?
Jacob Greenberg: I can. How's it going?
Jacob Sung: Great. 2. Jacobs.
Jacob Greenberg: Jacobs. Would you look at that?
Jacob Sung: I was like, wait, what is the circle bag? I'm using loop notes. What is that? Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: How do you like your AI recorder? Circle back's kind of new to us.
Jacob Sung: Yeah, I like loom a lot. Nice. Very fast. I mean as soon as meeting's done, you know the summary, the video is like sent it out within a minute.
Jacob Greenberg: Awesome.
Jacob Sung: And I like the summary much better than Gemini and other other AIs. Oh, cool.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, it's such a helpful tool to have it all recorded. All right, cool. I have half an hour on the calendar here. Jacob, does that work for you?
Jacob Sung: Yeah, yeah, that works. So let me see.
Jacob Greenberg: So, yeah, I got a very quick description from your. The form that you filled out. You guys are looking for an authorized a. You guys are an authorized agent of Michigan. You are looking to pull ach funds from employers who are legally participating in suchi program. So yeah, let me go.
Jacob Sung: I have a diagram. Maybe I can start sharing and give it maybe facilitate the discussion here. Let me know if you see my screen. Yep. Yeah. So what we're doing is I. And you know, are you familiar with 529 plan?
Jacob Greenberg: I'm not.
Jacob Sung: Which is a college savings program for your kids. Okay. So if you have kids start that program early because you know tuition is getting more expensive every year. So this is basically a wealth account and you open up individually and you own it and you have your. Your kids as a beneficiaries. Okay. So you can, you know, it's. It's tax free the earnings tax free as long as you use it on education, tuitions and etc. And now the government's like broadening so you can use it for trading, trade school and etc. But again this is a very individual plan. You buy for your family, for yourself. But we're trying to turn that into like an employer sponsorship. So think of 401k. Think of. Think of 401k where employers are actually sponsoring it and employer putting their matching fund as well as Europe contributing your own own money through payroll. Are you following so far? Yeah, yeah. So the basic 401k, replace that with 529 plan. We have a bunch of, you know, we have companies company A, B and C. We are the system of record where we know exactly the each company they sign up to suchi participated program. They sign or sign up all this legal documents etc. They come in, they define their matching Percentage their vesting period etc and then each employee have to come in and sign up just like how you sign up for 401k program. Okay. And you define your own as an employee. If I want to do 1%, 2%, 3% whatever the percentage you want to contribute from your salary or your per payroll. So there'll be two sources funding. Well there'll be two types of funding came coming out of the same employers payroll checking account. So that's that that has to be moved all the way to. So we're currently working with Michigan. There's a, you know don't mind about the name Michigan. You know met Michigan Education Trust and the Michigan Education SAMS plan. Think these are ach this bank account. We're, we are the. We're in the process of. We just got a note from Michigan. You know looks like we're two third way in in the legal process and we are very very confident it's going to happen and we'll be becoming authorized agent where the funding has to move from employer to eventually here or there depends on the program they're participating.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, got it. So you're going to be pulling money from the employer with an auto withdrawal.
Jacob Sung: Correct? Correct. We. Well I mean the amount will be always different. So employer have will given us give us the authorization so because you know payroll amount is always different. Right. So we will figure out exactly how much we need to pull it out and then we'll pull directly out of their checking account and move it exactly to the Michigan Trust.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, gotcha. And you guys are doing 100 of the transactions you guys are going to pull are going to be ACH transactions. There won't be any credit card or any other.
Jacob Sung: No, no no, no. You can't obviously you know they don't want to pay for your payroll.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. And then how many transactions are we you expecting to be doing in a given month?
Jacob Sung: So we are starting from Michigan. So so this is each payroll. I'm sorry, I'm sorry Employer. So if they're doing every two weeks payroll or twice a month payroll that's. That's how many transactions will come out of each company. Obviously we're going to start with company one but our target is to grow up to 50,000. That's pretty aggressive goal companies. Yes. And that's a pretty aggressive goal. I mean even we hit 10,000, that's actually a lot of money. We are talking to Maryland, Tennessee and other states. You know just give you a little bit of update. Michigan is a closed state Program where only residents of Michigan can participate, but other state programs they have, I call it nationwide, meaning anybody can participate. That will actually really widen out our customer base. The employer wise, when it takes off this, there's a lot of money moving actually.
Jacob Greenberg: So.
Jacob Sung: But again, the basis is per payroll. If someone's paying every week, then that's how many times it's going to move and it's going to be a bulk.
Jacob Greenberg: And is it. Yeah. So is it per employee per week or is it one?
Jacob Sung: No. Per employer. Because we're, we're doing a lump sum as a payroll. Whether you have 10,000, you have like five employee employer company or employee company or you know, 200 employee company. Right. A lump sum, we're pulling.
Jacob Greenberg: So for example, if you do start with just one company, you'll potentially either be having four individual transactions in a given month, one per week, or a different cadence if they schedule it.
Jacob Sung: Correct, Correct. So, you know, usually they usually pay every two weeks or twice. So.
Jacob Greenberg: So in that case, if you had 10,000 companies, there'd be 20,000 unique ACH transactions in a given month.
Jacob Sung: Yes.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha.
Jacob Sung: Yeah. I mean if we, I mean our rough calculation, if we hit 50,000 ish somewhere there, it's going to be like, I don't know, some several million. 16 million. I can't remember is quite a lot of money moving or what is the.
Jacob Greenberg: Average, what would you say the average sizes of these individual draws? Is it $100 each time? Is it $1,000? 10,000.
Jacob Sung: You know, I did a very conservative approach. Let's say someone's only contributing $50. Right. $50 per payroll. And then let's say it's, you know, they're, you know, 25 person. Again, just out of my hat, person is a tall. Then 25 person company, which is very conservative. $50, that's. And then there will be, there could be a matching coming in for an employer. So let's, let's make it 2,000 and then plus 50,000, that makes it, that makes 100 million actually per year.
Jacob Greenberg: So the average transaction like.
Jacob Sung: So let's, let's just say. Okay, right. So don't you, don't quote me on it. This is just, just my rough math. Let's say someone's doing only 25. Okay. Let's say $50 per payroll. And then everybody some, you know, this average company size is 25%. That's 12, 50, 12 $50 per payroll. Okay. So if they do it 24 times, there will be $30,000 per company here or roughly, you know, 1250 per payroll.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. Okay.
Jacob Sung: Now obviously it's not going to be all 25 person company. Right. We'll sign up 200, 300, you know, larger companies. We wanted, we do want to go for big fish. Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, got it. So I'll give you a little bit of background on Nickel. I'll walk you through kind of who we are, why we are and what we do and I'll show you a bit of the platform. But so nickel is founded by our founder who was the director of innovation at Stanley, Black and Decker. So we were initially built for the built world industry. So contracting construction places that had cash flows, really important. So a lot of these companies were doing very heavy in check. So we created a solution to be able to easily accept any type of payment that their customers prefer to pay in. So whether it's credit card ACH or without it, charging fees to the business and increased settlement times. Since then we've had a lot of other people signing up beyond the built world industries. But the offer unlimited free ach. And the reason we're able to do that is because 22% of the time roughly in the built world industries, their customers opt in to pay via credit card for cash flow advantage. When they pay with credit card, we get to keep the revenue from the credit card processing and that allows us and enables us to be able to offer free achieve. So we do occasionally support certain businesses that do really, really heavy ACH transactions, like many individual transactions without doing any credit card. When we do that, it typically does have a custom integration built in. If you're handling a lot of volume and some type of monthly fee in order to accommodate for that volume of ACH without the correct credit card processing works.
Jacob Sung: Yep.
Jacob Greenberg: So what I could do today is I can walk you through what the platform looks like. Looks like. Why not the technology, see if it's a flow that might make sense for you guys. I can take your information back into my internal team and see if we can map out something that may work for us. If that works for you.
Jacob Sung: Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: Awesome.
Jacob Sung: Yeah, I mean we're, we're ready to pay, but we're not ready to pay. You know, Stripe or Stripe Connect or some, some large institute, they want like $10,000 a month. Regardless there's a transaction or not, but we're not ready to pay 10,000.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. And what was that? Was that like a unique plan that they offered you guys or is that one of that.
Jacob Sung: No, I think they wanted to sell their kind of banking solution Interesting. Okay, like banking ledger solution. Right. Modern treasury, which is more than what we need.
Jacob Greenberg: And that, that costs 10k monthly is what they quoted you.
Jacob Sung: Yeah, but I mean, all we want is the money transfer, not the whole leisure, you know, banking as a service.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha, gotcha. And with that, with that solution, were they still charging you on the ach per transaction? On top of that, I think they're.
Jacob Sung: Charging like very minimum, like 25 cents or some. Somewhere like less. Not even a dollar.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha.
Jacob Sung: Okay, got it.
Jacob Greenberg: Here, let me share my screen here. So this is inside the nickel platform. I'm going to customize this demo a little bit for what you told me you guys would be operating in what you would mostly be doing. So I'm just going to show you the transactions tab here. It's a quick and easy way to navigate all the transactions. So you can think of nickel as the money flow of your business. And then what accounting system are you guys using at the moment?
Jacob Sung: We, well, we built our own accounting system to handle the money flow with a double entry and, and then, you know, coa.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, gotcha. So Nick will be what's moving your payments. You're able to download the CSV of all of your transactions and it's easy to sort through based on customer type, date, cost, etc. If you're trying to find any information about that individual invoice, the purpose of it. So if you do have correlating invoice numbers to customer types or payment types, you search for invoice number by receivables, payables, refunds, returns, etc.
Jacob Sung: Guys, your platform be able to send an invoice to the customer. Yep.
Jacob Greenberg: So you'd be living out of the get paid section. This is your accounts receivable where you could generate and send invoices to customers.
Jacob Sung: You know, that way they may actually work very nicely because we have to tell the employer saying that if we're withdrawing $5,000 for the payroll. Right. We have to tell them why we're drawing 5,000. Basically tell them that, hey, you, you said you're going to do employee matching here and these are the amount. So.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, so for you guys, you would be probably living out of this recurring invoice step. So right now we have a bunch of example recurring invoices. These would be all of the employers that you work with.
Jacob Sung: Yep.
Jacob Greenberg: And you could create a new invoice by going create a new customer here. I'll add my email address, invoice number, the amount and you'll set recurring here. You got the cadence. So you do every week, every month, every quarter, every year. If you do have somebody that requests bi weekly, we could update that for you with a custom setting or you can just stick to every week or every month.
Jacob Sung: Got it.
Jacob Greenberg: Any notes for customers about this invoice can go here and you could upload any documents that you want into the invoice itself. So if it's information about the program, the contract, net terms, etc. That could live right there on the invoice, you would essentially disable credit card payments.
Jacob Sung: Right.
Jacob Greenberg: They wanted to set it up on credit card and you had the go ahead and permission to do that. Is there a world, is there like regulation around not being able to pay in credit card?
Jacob Sung: We probably don't want, I mean if someone. Yeah, no, I don't know if the regulations probably not going to be able to accept credit card because I mean who's going to pay the fees?
Jacob Greenberg: That's a great question. So I'll show you what this looks like here. You can disable credit card if you.
Jacob Sung: Want to and then let the employer pay with the credit card and they, I mean they, they eat up the cost.
Jacob Greenberg: Exactly, yeah. So what this looks like. And I'm just going to go ahead and create this right now. Sends to myself. Ignore my messy email inbox here for a second. So this is what that email would look like. It's a recurring payment request. So degrad distribution is our demo account name. So this would be your company name. So suchi you'd have the invoice number here or the purpose, however you guys want to label it.
Jacob Sung: Yes.
Jacob Greenberg: This would be your logo and your company name and it'd be embedded in a link so that goes straight to your website. So you have a new payment request. Go ahead and click pay now. Any of the PDF documents that you uploaded associated with this invoice would be linked here. Any historic transactions that this employer had with you guys would be listed below the payment amount so they can access the entire history of all the transactions that they've had. This is only going to be popping up if it is a recurring payment, not a one time payment. It's very easy to do both one time and recurring and we present this to the customer. So 99% of nickel users will end up not disabling credit card. And the reason why they use nickel is because it gives your, the person you're invoicing, your customer, they have options. They have options. They get to choose what makes the most sense for them. So a lot of people do elect to do credit card just because it provides a cash flow advantage and you're.
Jacob Sung: Charging the fee right there.
Jacob Greenberg: Directly to the customer. So they have the choice to pay.
Jacob Sung: That makes sense. Yes.
Jacob Greenberg: Yep. The choice to pay for free or to incur the 2.99% fee. They could set this up in advance and you can auto charge them if you would like to. I could walk you through that process. Or you could send out this invoice bi weekly or monthly and they can fill it out on their own.
Jacob Sung: Okay. Is there anywhere we send an invoice and we can auto withdraw? Yep.
Jacob Greenberg: So when you go and you create a new customer here. Actually I might have already created you guys are ready. So I created suchi as a demo account come in here and you could add payment method on file. Now you could request that from the customer. If you have the information already provided to you, you can enter it. So you can enter their card information or their bank information and all you would need is an authorization document to be able to auto withdraw or you can just send them a request.
Jacob Sung: So authorize this document is some sort of bank statement or signed a document from.
Jacob Greenberg: It's like a document from the.
Jacob Sung: From the person who's receiving the invoice. Correct.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, so here we'll have this email such you wants to save your payment method on file. Gives you a little bit of background about what Nicola. I see security. They'd agree to the terms and conditions and then they'd upload their bank information or their card information. And once they save it, you'll be able to go into here, create an invoice and when you go into your invoice. So we created a demo one already. We could either mark this as paid, we could get paid. So we could schedule the charge right away by going charge payment method on file. If it's recurring, it will automatically withdraw the same amount on a monthly, weekly, whatever the basis is. And that's about it.
Jacob Sung: So everything we just did through UI, this is also possible through APIs.
Jacob Greenberg: So what would you require an API.
Jacob Sung: For specifically populating the amount basically automatically like you know, automating everything. Right. Because our system will basically every payroll runs, then we'll, I will detect and you know, we'll get the payroll data. We did all the calculation, we know who to go hold the fund and it'll be always recurring. Right. So then we have to put the amount it's like for us probably it's like immediate like pay us.
Jacob Greenberg: So where.
Jacob Sung: But what would the API be for.
Jacob Greenberg: Like where would you be sending this information to?
Jacob Sung: Sending information to what you mean? I mean our, our system will be calling your APIs.
Jacob Greenberg: If you have the API would be for your accounting system or.
Jacob Sung: Our system suchi system will calculate and instead of creating an invoice, we want to automate creating the invoice including the who. Who we are invoicing to customer and then the amount and the due date. Due dates almost immediate.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha.
Jacob Sung: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: So we, we can and we have built webhooks and AI agentic connections before APIs. We have done once in a while it's going to be a customer request that I would need to pitch to the, to the development team to see if it's something we can build. I'll tell you off the bat that if it's not going to be a high credit card return on investment.
Jacob Sung: Right. We're not, we're not a high paying customer.
Jacob Greenberg: Also, you know, if it is a, if we're developing the API for an internal tool that you guys are the only people in the world that have it, it's custom to you. That's also a harder sell for me.
Jacob Sung: It shouldn't be custom to us. If I pitch you guys decide to do it should have a very generic API to access nickel. Right. So then a consumer like us or whichever company is using nickel, you guys have the API. We'll just consume the APIs. But you know, for a starter. Right. The manual entry would actually work for us because we have, we have like deadline coming up and we were thinking, you know, Even company offers APIs we probably have to do a lot of things manually even maybe, I mean it's just calculation coming up. Maybe customer success. People have to do a manual entry for now.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. So and yeah, I guess over the next 12 months like what is your estimated amount of processing with this ach withdrawal?
Jacob Sung: I mean we, our launch date is end of December or early January with Michigan and our aggressive goal is sign up 50,000 employers.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay.
Jacob Sung: And then on the same time we're talking to other states. But as far as this money movement, right. You don't see any issues like I don't know, aml, anti money laundry laws or. Right. I just want to make sure that you know.
Jacob Greenberg: With this volume. Is that the question?
Jacob Sung: Well, how the money flows from employers to the destination account?
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, I mean the way that money flows through nickel, we process it in very compliant and secure way. Okay. But that's really the only part of the process that we're involved within and that we have responsibility towards. But yeah, it is something that I think we would. Let me talk internally to my team, see if this is something that we can help support. Do you have a deadline for this project that I should be aware of?
Jacob Sung: Earlier the better we are. We actually built almost all our systems. Actually we're all working right now. We're missing the money movement portion. So we're trying to quickly feel that and like I said, meet for next, you know, six months a year. We don't mind just doing manual sending to customer service. They do it maybe, you know, every payroll got you.
Jacob Greenberg: And the average amount per employer is going to be around a thousand BI weekly. So 2000amonth.
Jacob Sung: You know, that's just my really guess, right? Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: Just trying to get an estimate.
Jacob Sung: Yeah, let's just say about 2000. Let's say 1500. 2000 somewhere there.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay.
Jacob Sung: You know, assuming that there are some matchings, there's maybe some comments. They don't do matching. Okay, cool.
Jacob Greenberg: Let me take this to my team. I'll see what type of information I could get back for you, Jacob, and see if we could come up with an agreement that will work for you guys.
Jacob Sung: All right.
Jacob Greenberg: All right, cool.
Jacob Sung: All right. Thank Jacob.
Jacob Greenberg: You got it. I'll talk to you.
Jacob Sung: Wait for your email. Appreciate it. Thank you.
Jacob Greenberg: Bye.
