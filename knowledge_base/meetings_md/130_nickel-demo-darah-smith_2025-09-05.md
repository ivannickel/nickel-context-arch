Darah T. Tabuteau: Two years in Virginia, in Blackstone, Virginia. So we just, her mom is buried there. She grew up in Blackstone, Virginia. So we went to visit her grave and my aunt, she's in Springfield. And we still have some family in Virginia. So we just went back so my mom could visit her sister and cousins. For a little while, but I've always been in New York.
Jacob Greenberg: Oh, nice. We're based in New York as well. That's. I grew up in Brooklyn myself.
Darah T. Tabuteau: Oh, okay. I'm out here in Long Island in Freeport.
Jacob Greenberg: Nice.
Darah T. Tabuteau: Yeah, but I live in Dix Hills.
Jacob Greenberg: Oh, okay. Nice. Well, I have. I have 30 minutes on our. On the calendar for us today. Does that work for you still?
Darah T. Tabuteau: Yeah, that's fine.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, great. So I know that you and Zak connected very briefly. Really, the purpose of our call today is for me to learn just a little bit more about your business. How you're currently doing AR and AP. I know you're using QuickBooks, but maybe you could give me a little bit more background how you work for yourself and your clients. And I'll give you a little bit of background on Nickel. Towards the end of our call, I'll customize the demo around the information you give me, so I'm only giving you relevant information to your business. And hopefully the outcome of this call is you have a firmer understanding of Nickel and what next steps might be should you think it'd be a good partnership and want to move forward. Does that sound fair?
Darah T. Tabuteau: Yes.
Jacob Greenberg: Awesome. So you are you a tax?
Darah T. Tabuteau: I'm sorry, I didn't catch that.
Jacob Greenberg: Are you a CPA? You manage taxes. Is that correct or?
Darah T. Tabuteau: Well, I'm not a CPA, but I do have my own tax preparation company. I've been in business now for 28 years. I am a home-based business. I have roughly 700 or so clients. I use QuickBooks to manage my business and to manage some of my clients. I normally use Square or to take payments or I use AE in the audio. Transcribe the English words that are spoken. Oh, wow. Yeah, so it's kind of hard.
Jacob Greenberg: To.
Darah T. Tabuteau: Keep track of all of these payments coming in from various locations. So it gets kind of daunting, but people, they don't want to, you know, obviously pay the fees because paying 2.9% or 3% transaction fees, It gets costly and I have to transfer that over to the client so they would rather use AE as opposed to Square.
Jacob Greenberg: Of course.
Darah T. Tabuteau: When you use your credit card or your debit card, you get charged your fee.
Jacob Greenberg: All right, so this seems like at least for your business, for your personal accounts receivables, I have a feeling and you'll let me know once I give you a demo that this is going to be a slam dunk option for you. It's free to get started with Nickel depending on the size of the transactions you do. So I'll ask a couple more questions so I could hone in a little bit more. But really the reason why Nickel was built, I'll give you a little bit of background about us before I ask another question or two. But we were, our founder worked at Stanley Black & Decker before as the Director of Innovation. And the construction industry is such a discombobulated payments related industry. People are sending payments in all these different electronic ways like you, Cash App, Zelle, et cetera, but it's also very check heavy. And so he wanted to create a tool for contractors and construction groups to be able to offer one unified link to enable their customers to pay however they want to. Keep it organized for the business, but at the same time reduce any fee that's affiliated with making those AR payments so that you can actually offer your customer the payment experience that they prefer, the optionality of paying however they'd like, but without it taking a toll on your business whatsoever. So that's why we offer completely free ACH. We have 2.99% credit card. And I understand Square is around 3.5 right now. Is that right?
Darah T. Tabuteau: Yeah. I think it's depending on which credit cards. I think Amex is more expensive than the other ones. Yeah. Plus 50 cents or something.
Jacob Greenberg: Right. Now you're collecting these payments. Sorry. I'm in Brooklyn. There are horns talking out my window. Let me close my door real quick.
Darah T. Tabuteau: Oh, I didn't even hear it. So.
Jacob Greenberg: Sounds crazy out there. All right.
Darah T. Tabuteau: I can imagine.
Jacob Greenberg: So you said you're collecting these payments from several hundred clients. What is the average transaction size that you're collecting? And are you doing this on a monthly basis or like an annual basis? How does that work?
Darah T. Tabuteau: Well, this will doing, especially during the tax season, it's on a daily basis. After the tax season is over, It's not that many transactions, but it could be on a weekly basis then starting maybe I'll say June through December. It could be on a weekly basis because not that many transactions are going through. But January through maybe the end of May, June, it's definitely on a daily basis.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, so can you help me understand like from January to June, you're accepting like one payment a day or is it multiple payment? How many payments are you looking at per average on month during the high season?
Darah T. Tabuteau: During the high seasons, that's a good question. I would want to say on average at least maybe three to five payments via credit or debit card per day. Like I said, most people, they want to avoid the fees, so they're sending Zelle. They're trying to get away from the fees. So.
Jacob Greenberg: Right.
Darah T. Tabuteau: So now that Zelle, you know, even cash app, they want to do cash app. I mean, even though, like, I know I don't have to. Cash out from Cash App. So I'll do give them that option as well.
Jacob Greenberg: So I will walk you through besides the cost saving for your customer benefit for your business is we do integrate directly with QuickBooks, which I understand you're using. So for these roughly 900 payments that you're accepting between January and June, you won't have to individually reconcile that with your QuickBooks. Every payment is made and it automatically syncs in QuickBooks on your behalf. So is that something that you think would have a positive impact for you personally in your business?
Darah T. Tabuteau: Oh, yeah, yeah, it definitely will. I mean, I already, you know, any income that goes into QuickBooks, it is already reconciled automatically anyway, so currently.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. Oh, so you're sending out the invoices from QuickBooks and then people are deciding to pay you in a different payment type?
Darah T. Tabuteau: Well, no, I don't send invoices through QuickBooks at all. So with my business, what I usually do is I'll send the invoices through Square for people who want to pay with their credit or debit card. Anyone else, let's just say if you want to pay through Zelle, I'll just tell people, Hey, this is what you owe me and they're just sending it through Zelle. Initiate invoices for every tax client.
Jacob Greenberg: Got it. And then once, so you're individually going based on the request of your customer to the specific payment platform that they prefer, sending out that request. Once you get that payment, I assume it settles in your bank account and then you need to go and update QuickBooks or update QuickBooks afterwards. Am I capturing that accurately?
Darah T. Tabuteau: No, I don't have to update QuickBooks because it those bank accounts are already linked to QuickBooks, so I don't have to go in to update it.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, the bank accounts.
Darah T. Tabuteau: It's already. You already think so.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. All right. And then what are the average size of these transactions? Typically.
Darah T. Tabuteau: Typically the average size, it does depend on the client, you know, so I just have. I have basic clients that could be maybe on average 285. And then I have business clients who could be $1,200.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. And then for your business clients, do you handle any of the ARAP for them or are you just getting that one-time payment for tax services?
Darah T. Tabuteau: No, just getting the one-time payment. I sometimes, well, I don't do any accounts receivables for them, so I'll just do the QuickBooks. I reconcile their QuickBooks for them maybe a couple of times throughout the year, or I'll just do it one time at the end of the year to prepare for the tax season, and that's it.
Jacob Greenberg: Got it. Straightforward enough. I'm going to pop open my demo environment. Give me one second here. I'll show you two. One is going to have some dummy information that we uploaded into our demo account so you can see what it looks like once you're actually managing transactions. Then one is going to be pretty quickly after we started working with contractors and construction companies. The next type of business that started reaching out to us was accounting firms looking for ways to handle payments for their clients. So I'll show you both in case it's interesting to you. You might be able to just live off of the basic version of Nickel. But the reason I asked for the volume and size of your transactions is because we do have two payment, we have two platforms. One is completely free to use and get started. But there is a cap on the transaction size. So it caps you at $25,000 per individual transaction. Now, if your transactions are all going to be underneath that, you'll be able to use the free platform and get signed up. If what I show you makes sense, is interesting, and can save you some money and your customers some money, then I could just show you how to get started today. You could create an account, take your time to test some payments, and if you have any questions, you'd feel free to reach out. We could set up a follow-up call if you would like. The other version is only $35 a month. Transaction volume can be above $25,000 per transaction, and it has a one day quicker turnaround time. Our credit card turnaround time is one day, and our ACH turnaround time is two to three days. I'm going to pop open this environment and show you here. It seems like you're, correct me if I'm wrong, it seems like the two biggest things that we're looking at here is the fact that you need to manage multiple different types of payment types for your customers and maybe taking time to send out payments via multiple different applications, and also that your customers want to avoid high fees. Is there anything else that we should be focusing on during this call?
Darah T. Tabuteau: No, those two are the main things.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, awesome. Those are two things that we can very easily solve. Can you see my screen here, Darah?
Darah T. Tabuteau: Yes.
Jacob Greenberg: Awesome. So this is inside Nickel. You're going to be able to see a summary of all of your transactions. And you'll be able to dive into each of your transactions, whether it's accounts receivable or if you do have accounts payable, you can do that through here as well. So say you have some recurring charges like rent or something like that, you can make it from here if you would like. But for the most part, it seems like you're going to be living in this accounts receivables tab. This is more of just a transaction overview. All of this, like I said, would be a two-way sync with Nickel. So any previous customer information you have in QuickBooks, I mean, a two-way sync with QuickBooks. So any previous customer information you have in QuickBooks, once you come into the platform, you'll go to account settings and integrations and you just click link QuickBooks. Your first time syncing it, it might take up to a minute or two for it to fully sync depending on how much info you have in your QuickBooks. But after that, it's going to be an automatic update every single time a transaction happens. So this is just a quick overview of all of your transactions, what account it's coming from, what account it's going to, and if you have invoice numbers or purposes, they'll show up here just to make it easy to track. If you would like, you could also download it by CSV. But really where the magic happens is going to be over here in the Get Paid section. This is your Accounts Receivable tab. I'll show you a couple different things that might be interesting to you here. You can create an invoice from within Nickel, or you could create an invoice from within QuickBooks and it will sync to Nickel, and then you just need to press Send. That would look like this here. This is an invoice that was created outside of Nickel, and all I have to do is click Request Payment and it will send the payment link. I'll show you what that payment link looks like in 30 seconds. But first, I want to show you this generic payment portal that some of our customers use, not all of them. Most people are sending out individual transaction invoices, but some of our customers will have a pay now button on their website. It will pop open this window. It'll have your company name here and your logo and an image that you want to upload. And you could customize these fields to say whatever you want them to say. You can have invoice number or purpose or their name and you can add more fields and the payment amount and they just make the payment. For some people that's helpful. Probably our oldest customer here is this company called Chicago Brass. What they do is on the bottom of their website, they just have a pay invoice button and it opens up into their specific payment portal here. And people can go ahead and make payments from here. For you, I think that the most efficient and effective way to do what you're doing now but to save time and increase organization and reduce cost would be to create the individual invoices either from QuickBooks or from within Nickel and send them out from Nickel.
Darah T. Tabuteau: This is similar to Square because in Square I go in, I create the invoices and send it directly either to their email or to their cell phone. It creates a link and then they can just pay it however they want. The only difference is with Square, they're being charged. Or if I don't add in when I send the invoice, if I don't add in that 4%, processing fee, then whatever I'm charging them, it's being deducted from what I'm getting paid.
Jacob Greenberg: Right, exactly. So there's one less step here. The other thing is that there are a couple features I'll show you that are more conducive for businesses than Square sending it out. And the big thing here is that we are like an AR/ AP management solution. So firstly, the cost will be reduced. For credit card. It'll also present them the option to pay via ACH for completely free. And we handle all of the fees associated, so you literally just need to send them what their bill costs. They get the option to choose to pay however they want. Some people prefer credit card, some people prefer ACH. If they're paying, and I'll show you what this looks like in a second, it's easier to show than tell, but essentially they have the option to pay with a fee or to pay without a fee. And it's up to them. What we found is 17% of the time, it's unexpectedly customers of Nickel users, Nickel users who got on Nickel saying, oh, my customers just want a free transaction type. They'll send out these invoices and they'll have multiple ways to pay, whether for free or for with credit card. We found that 17% of the time, their customers actually preferred paying in credit card, even if the fees were clearly presented to them just for cash flow advantage, for them. And it's a 2.9% fee, which is less than Square's. So most customers that pay that way already have like a 3% cash back card or something to zero it out. But I'll walk you through this. And then the one thing that I do want to highlight, and this is from my experience, I worked with restaurants a couple years ago before working with Nickel. And, you know, Square is very common in restaurants, so I know processing very well with Square. One thing to be aware of is there are in New state certain surcharging laws around passing the fee to the customer. And the regulations around it for New York state specifically is that you have to, you can't charge more than what the credit card company is charging you to process the payment. Right. So you just need to be very careful about that if you continue to do manually updating the invoices because they carry some pretty serious fees. But it's harder for them to identify that that's happening if it's not like in a restaurant environment, but it does apply to all businesses. So do you typically use invoice numbers? Do you put like a purpose on the transaction instead?
Darah T. Tabuteau: Oh, yeah, I just put what it was for, like, tax preparation fee or whatever.
Jacob Greenberg: Tax prep fee June 2025. Or you could just do for sure. And put $500 here. You can make it a one-time payment or recurring payments. Do you ever do recurring payments or are they all one time?
Darah T. Tabuteau: No, they're all one time.
Jacob Greenberg: Awesome. So we'll just pop in here and do one time. Put any additional information you want. So tax prep. Additional information here. For your review. And the other cool thing with this is you can upload any amount of documents that are relevant to this transaction. So I don't know if you have contracts or invoices or any information that's specific to a customer, but you could put that on the transaction level itself. So you don't, you could, you know, reduce the amount of back and forth if there are instances like that. And now Pop into the Advanced tab here. You can enable or disable credit card payments if you want, but they will always have the option to pay for free via ACH, so most customers keep this enabled. You can enable the customer to edit the payment amount, so say you're charging $1,000, the customer can decide on their own if they want to pay half in credit card and half in ACH, and it doesn't make an impact for you whatsoever. And you can also customize fees. So if you do have customers, this is mostly for more industrial businesses that use us that might have large repeat business with another distributor or manufacturer, but they'll share the credit card percentage. So if you wanted to, you can split this with your customer 50/50, but again, most users will just offer all of it. To the customer for the luxury of being able to pay for free. And you click done and you automatically create this invoice. Again, if you created it within QuickBooks, it will just populate automatically into Nickel. And then you can put again your phone number or your customer's email to send out this link. And I'll show you what that looks like. Alternatively, you could also charge the payment method on file. Do you already collect customer banking information or do they just enter it every time you send them an invoice?
Darah T. Tabuteau: Wait, say that again?
Jacob Greenberg: Do you currently like collect and store your customers banking info or do you just send them the invoice and they fill it out that one time?
Darah T. Tabuteau: Oh, no, I don't, in order for me to save their credit card information or bigger information, I have to get them to sign a separate form. So I just don't save it. I save their personal information, but I don't keep their their bank information in Square.
Jacob Greenberg: If it were easier to get them to sign that form, is that something like having their bank info stored? Is that even beneficial for you?
Darah T. Tabuteau: I mean, it could be beneficial for me. It's just with spam and all these cyber fraud and all that other stuff, I don't even like doing it.
Jacob Greenberg: Right. Okay, cool.
Darah T. Tabuteau: I don't even like saving it.
Jacob Greenberg: That's another reason why Nickel is helping is we're SOX 2 compliant. We have really high, we call it industrial strength security. Nickel processes of up to $2 million to $3 million per transaction for larger industrial customers. So we're insured directly by the Fed. We are connected directly to the Fed or banking rails. And we have a way to collect and store that customer information. That actually puts all the liability on us. We have the security built into our system so that you don't have to manually keep or store these records and we will be responsible for PCI and Soft2Compliance. And I'll show you that in a second. Interesting. But for now, I'm just going to show you what it looks like to send and receive one of these invoices for your customers. So I just click pay or make request. It lives within a link. I'll show you the email. This is where it pops up. Ignore my busy email, but it will come and it'll say your company name here. It'll say the purpose memo or invoice number that you enter on the invoice here. Then it will say your company name here. You'll have your own logo. It says you have a new payment request. Formal, branded towards you, comes in as a text message or comes in as an email for your customers. We'll say Darah has requested a new payment. It'll say the amount and when the due date is and some basic information here. So again, purpose or invoice number and a memo if you want to include one. Then all you do is click pay now. It opens up this invoice. And as you see, they'll have the option to pay by card or to pay by bank. Paying by bank, there's absolutely no fees. We're the only business out there right now that's doing 100% free ACH. Or they have the option to pay by card. If they do pay by card, it will show them the fee and it will automatically update that total so that you don't have to worry about doing that on your end manually for each of these 900 transactions that you're doing over a six month period. Right. Makes it so much like little things like this, especially at the volume you're doing, end up saving so much time in organization.
Darah T. Tabuteau: It does save a lot of time. I got to get my calculator out. I got to take stuff a lot of time.
Jacob Greenberg: I mean, yeah, even two minutes more per transaction, right? That's 1,800 minutes you're spending on just redundant tasks that can be automated.
Darah T. Tabuteau: Exactly. Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: It's a lot of time.
Darah T. Tabuteau: That's a bathroom break that I so very much need, you know?
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, exactly. You get to take care of yourself during the day instead of just your customers.
Darah T. Tabuteau: Exactly.
Jacob Greenberg: That's important. Awesome. Well, yeah, I mean that two minutes for those transactions, if it truly is just two minutes, it's going to save you 60 hours during that high season, which is, you know, a full week of work.
Darah T. Tabuteau: Literally. That's a lot of time. Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: And that's just for that one step of calculating, you know, the-- When you.
Darah T. Tabuteau: Put it into a perspective like that, it's just like, wow, I've been wasting a lot of time.
Jacob Greenberg: And Pete, that's the thing is people don't really know. And I think that, you know, I think it's a good sign that you're curious to learn more about new solutions that come out. A lot of people are when we bring up, hey, we're going to save some money for you and your customers. But you don't know what you don't know, right? And I think that a lot of times we'll have customers that are like, Nope, I've been doing it the same way for 40 years. Everything's fine. There's nothing that can be improved. Don't even tell me what my options are, right? And it's so hard for me to let them go because I'm like, oh, if you've been doing it for 40 years the same way, I know I could save you like three weeks of your entire life every year.
Darah T. Tabuteau: Just give me five minutes.
Jacob Greenberg: Please, you know, right?
Darah T. Tabuteau: It's like people are afraid of change. It's like as soon as something changes, everything in the universe goes wrong.
Jacob Greenberg: Right, exactly. But the cool thing with this platform, you know, and I've worked at a bunch of other software companies in my past and a lot of times really big impact for the tool on the business that works with it. But there is like some serious implementation time involved. So it takes commitment to like really get it going. The awesome thing about Nickel is you literally pop in there, create your account, sign up, click Link QuickBooks, wait 30 seconds to a minute, and then you can just start going right away. It really is a really quick implementation time. It's very light lift, saves a lot of money for your customers and a lot of time for yourself as well. So this is what that invoice would look like. Any of the documents you have will show here, and if I click on it, I could download it as your customer. Any notes will be present here and any previous transactions will actually show beneath this field here. If you've had historic transactions with those customers, they'll be able to see their payment history with you. Again, everything's customizable, so all these features you can toggle on and off depending on how you want to share it. They could update the payment information as well, so they could say, hey, I'm going to actually pay 250 on credit. I'll do 250 on bank right here, and they'll enter their information and just press pay. Now, once that happens, you'll come into your invoices in the active tab. You'll see all of your outstanding requests that you've made that haven't been paid yet. And if you need to remind them, you could just click this button. It'll send them a reminder to their phone or their email, whatever information you've uploaded. And if it's been completed, it'll automatically go into the paid section here. Very easy to track. And you could search and filter by pretty much anything you can think of. So the name of the invoice, the customer name itself, any draft invoices that you have that you haven't sent out, the amount that you requested, you could even filter by just to see larger or smaller transactions, make sure nothing's slipping through the cracks, or you could filter by date. And it's that simple for AR. And then customers as well, you'll be able to manage all of your customer information here. I have one more thing I do want to show you before I hop. I know we're coming to time already, but I do want to show you what it looks like to get your customers to add their own banking information to store on the website because it is really easy and clean. And it might save you even more time because you could auto charge them on specific dates should you elect to. But before I get to that, what I showed you so far with AR for invoicing, does this seem like it's something that would fit with your business?
Darah T. Tabuteau: Yes, absolutely. The only thing is I don't have my, like I said, I don't invoice my clients in QuickBooks, so when I do go to invoice them, I just have to start all over, but that's fine because everything is in Square.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. Even better. So you said right now though, you do have your Square payments and all that. That is synced to QuickBooks so far so that when somebody pays you there, it automatically updates in QuickBooks. Is that accurate?
Darah T. Tabuteau: From Square?
Jacob Greenberg: From Zelle, Cash App, Square.
Darah T. Tabuteau: Not from Square. It doesn't update into QuickBooks. Not directly from Square, no, from my bank accounts.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. Okay, understood. Whatever it does exist in QuickBooks, if you want to pull it in, it can be pulled in. Otherwise, what you can do is just come in here and create your new invoices from here. It'll take five seconds and you don't have to go across 10 different payment types. Right. So the last thing I want to show you before I do have to hop is on the customer side. So let's add a new customer. I'll type my email address here just so that I can show you the email that gets sent out. And again, this is an option. This isn't mandatory. I just thought it might be cool for you. You'll go ahead and click Set Payment Authorization. If you do have that customer info, you can enter it on your own. But typically, you'll be requesting this, so please update your banking info or something along these lines and send in request. I'll get an email that's a little bit different than the last one. It says payment authorization request for and then your company name will go here. Again, your logo and your company name will be here and you click complete payment method. Now, it's a three-step process. Really quick overview on what is Nickel and what this authorization is for. Click Get Started. You just agree to these terms very quickly, and then you choose to put in your information, whether it's bank or card. All they have to do is click Sync with Plaid, and it will automatically update it for them if they want to. So they don't have to go through the process of typing in all of this twice. Then once that's done, it's saved. We save it on the back end so that you're not responsible for managing PCI compliance and SOC 2. Go into Get Paid and say, oh, I do have Darah's information. I put the due date on the 5th. I essentially let Darah know that I will be charging X amount on the 5th. I can just go ahead. And click Get Paid, Charge Payment Method on File in Charge Customer, and it will automatically withdraw those funds and settle that invoice for you. Okay.
Darah T. Tabuteau: You can set that to be automated.
Jacob Greenberg: As well, so any customers that have preemptively updated their information, maybe at the beginning of the year, the beginning of tax season, you don't even have to send out the payment requests anymore. They'll just be notified once they've been charged. Or you could continue to send the individual invoices. That is completely up to you in the way you'd like to design your business.
Darah T. Tabuteau: That sounds great. This seems like it will be definitely smoother than what I've used to doing.
Jacob Greenberg: Awesome. Well, is there, you know, typically what I offer is after the first call, I'll set up a second call Just to give you some space, if you wanna get going, I can answer any questions for the integration, and I could help you do your first couple test transactions just so you feel comfortable and hit the ground running. Is this something that you feel like you'd implement right away, or is there a timeline that I should be aware of for you wanting to move forward on this?
Darah T. Tabuteau: Yes, this is something that I would want to implement right away. I would like to get used to doing it, so by the time tax season roll around, I'll be a pro at it and I won't have any hiccups, you know, so this definitely will give me enough time to figure everything out. And then I could just type in, you know, create customers in there. So by the time, you know, tax season roll around, most of them should be in there already.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. Yeah, great. So what I would do if I were you, is today at some point I just hop into www.getnickel.com, sign up for your free account, you'll go ahead and link your bank information and you'll link your QuickBooks if you want to link your QuickBooks. And then I do a couple test transactions. Give me a heads up when you're about to do them so I could let my support team know that we're onboarding you. And what we can do is follow up call with you maybe sometime early next week to answer any questions you might have throughout that process. Or we can do next Friday, one week from now, to give you a little bit of time to play around.
Darah T. Tabuteau: Okay, sounds good. One week from now should be good. So I'll do that later on today. I'll get everything downloaded and started, and let's do this next week.
Jacob Greenberg: Sounds good. I'll send out an invite for next week, 10:30. And if you need to update it, feel free.
Darah T. Tabuteau: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: Awesome.
Darah T. Tabuteau: All right.
Jacob Greenberg: If you have any questions in the meantime, please don't hesitate to reach out to me via email. You should have my email from the calendar invite and I'll send you another one as well.
Darah T. Tabuteau: All right. Thank you, Jacob. Thank you, Zak.
Jacob Greenberg: It's been a pleasure.
Darah T. Tabuteau: Happy we made time, Darah T. Tabuteau. Thanks for your time. Have a great rest of your day.
Jacob Greenberg: Thank you.
Darah T. Tabuteau: Bye bye.
