Jacob Greenberg: So by the end of this call, what I'll do is I'll show you a little bit of a demo based on the information you give me about your current process and we can map out next steps if it makes sense to have another call. Or I could just show you what it takes to get started on your own. Nickel is a very light lift, easy implementation with a high return on investment for you guys. So you might be able to just implement it on your own. But by the end of this call, we'll be able to decide whether or not we should have a follow up. Does that sound fair?
wgrantsynn: Yes.
Jacob Greenberg: Awesome. So would you give me a little bit of background about your role inside HDD and kind of what you guys are all about, your current processes?
wgrantsynn: Well, I'm the controller for HDD as well as one of the other U.S. divisions. Our current process, everything goes through Procurify. All purchase orders go through Procurify and from there they are then uploaded into Great Plains where the checks are cut in terms of accounts receivable, those are processed through great planes. They're manually generated in Excel and then uploaded into Great Plans to be captured within the accounting software. The reason we manually generate them is they're part of a billing package which includes daily work reports and so these. And it just makes sense to do it that way because last month we invoiced twice for multi million dollar contracts. So it's not like we have volume going out every day.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha.
wgrantsynn: The ap, there's volume every day, but for accounts receivable, not so much.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha.
wgrantsynn: So I've been approached by some of your, I'm sure, competitors before and it just, it does, it didn't make sense to me because you know, we, we do accounts payable processing, but not really accounts receivable process.
Jacob Greenberg: Seems like you do occasional accounts receivable, but they're just fewer transactions and maybe larger volume transactions. Is that accurate?
wgrantsynn: Correct.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, gotcha. So just a couple more questions for some more clarity. So for the AP side, just to make sure I'm getting this correct, purchase orders are going through Procurify and then there are Great Planes as your kind of catch all accounting system for accounts for reconciliation purposes. And then for the accounts receivable, you're generating the invoices within Excel, uploading them into Great Plans as your accounting system to be captured within that software. And you're doing fewer but higher volume transactions for AR than you are for ap.
wgrantsynn: Correct.
Jacob Greenberg: Can you walk me through the process of. Once you send out anything from great plans. So either for AP or for ar, are you making the payments and receiving the payments out of the great plain software or do you use something else in between that?
wgrantsynn: No, we cut, we cut. Our check runs are cut out of great planes.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay. When you're doing ap, are you primarily using check to make payments or do you guys do ACH or credit card?
wgrantsynn: We are converting to ACH within the year. So right now everything is still checks with occasional achs, but we are, we are up in Canada where our parent company is located. They have converted to ACH and we are getting ready to roll that out here in the United States. Actually right now we're just getting set up with the bank. We're testing our import files with them right now so that we can properly send remittance advices to our vendors.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. Okay, so this transition to ACH started top down in Canada where the parent company is located. Your process right now for testing out ACH payments as a transfer over from checks is direct with the bank. So you're using the bank to send out the ACH payment requests or to make.
wgrantsynn: Yes.
Jacob Greenberg: And then who are you banking with? Is it American based or is it Canadian based?
wgrantsynn: We in the, down here in the States, we bank with Chase.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, okay, great. So we do work with AP as well as ar. We're mostly focused on improving savings on the AR side. But we have had a lot of success. Success helping companies like yours on the AP side, especially if they're going straight to bank to do the ach. Nickel is just an easier way to stay organized and have the exact low cost. Occasionally banks even charge for ach. Sometimes they don't. Nickel. It's completely free to do ach. Just so you know, before I get into it a little bit deeper, our founder was the director of innovation at Stanley, Black and Decker, which was our first backer. And we were initially built for the contract against Construction World. So what we call the Built World industries because typically these, whether it's AR or AP transactions are typically pretty sizable. Cash flow is top priority. And what we did is we built a technology that's able to handle larger scale transactions. A lot of processors might cap you at 25,000 or 30,000 per transaction. We can do multi million dollar transactions on single transaction basis with a one to one reconciliation. So what that means is instead of, instead of maybe a million dollars coming through ACH getting dispersed into your bank as like 10 different transactions, $100000 transactions, it's just one to one. So it's easier for accounting. But also the way we develop this new technology enables us to offer completely unlimited free ACH of any size. But the big thing here that we've kind of developed is we give your customers and you the ability to pay in whichever way you prefer, whether it's ACH check or credit card organized in a single very well presented portal for payment. And we make sure that everything is getting settled in a one to do time frame, regardless of payment type, and that the company that is using nickel is not incurring any fees for any transactions, whether it's for ACH or check. So that's how we're saving companies five to 15 hours a week. And manual reconciliation work, which it seems like you guys are making a movement from check over to ACH anyway. But, but also for, for fees, we're removing all the fees associated with transacting for both AP and ar. So that's just a little bit of background on nickel and kind of where we got started, which is why we reach out to you specifically because you're in an industry that we primarily were built for. Does that, does that make sense so far?
wgrantsynn: Yes, it does.
Jacob Greenberg: Fantastic. Okay, great. So I understand that you guys are testing with ACH for banking with Chase and you're making that transition as a top down priority and that's on the AP side. On the AR side, are you got. Do you have similar initiatives to move over from checks and ar? Are you primarily doing checks for AR? Right now.
wgrantsynn: We accept payment, whatever form they want to send it to us.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay.
wgrantsynn: Generally they're sending us ACHs, but we have the occasional person who cuts us a 2.8 million dollar check, which is always fun to have in your hand.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, I can imagine. Okay, so generally when they do send the ach, because that seems to be the priority. Or actually do you guys ever accept credit card for these?
wgrantsynn: No.
Jacob Greenberg: And why is that?
wgrantsynn: The volume, the, the percentage that the credit card company would take for these. It's just obscene. So no, we don't. Yeah, we don't ever do small stuff. Everything is always really at least, at least six figures, usually seven.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, so you're not accepting credit card because you would be liable to pay that transaction amount and it's too big.
wgrantsynn: Yes.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, great. And, but you say you're already generally doing ACH instead of check for these transactions. How are you guys processing these ACH payments? Do you ex. Yeah, walk me through that process right now.
wgrantsynn: Well, generally we receive the remittance advice from the customer.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay.
wgrantsynn: And a notification from our bank saying it's inbound, and the next day it shows up in our US Account and we process it accordingly and our accounts receive, you know, Great Plains software. And, and then as a rule, that money gets swept into a holding account for our United States holding, you know, holding company. And sometimes if it's material enough, it'll get wired up to Canada.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. So for these larger ACH transactions that you guys are doing for ar, you're receiving the information from the customer, inputting it into your bank, who makes the request for the payment. They notify you when it's inbound. It'll show up within a day or two days. Then you're manually entering it into the Great Plains accounting system and from there it might get moved to a holding account within the US and sometimes from there pushed up to Canada.
wgrantsynn: Yes.
Jacob Greenberg: Awesome. Okay, great.
wgrantsynn: Cool.
Jacob Greenberg: So essentially what we can support you guys with is a couple steps, really. Nickel is very customizable to whatever process you would prefer. And it opens up some, some different doors that you might have prevented doing, like credit card because of the processing cost, it opens up that door as a possibility. But there's many different ways that you can optimize nickel to be based on your business. So took up 10 minutes to learn a little more about your company. We have 20 minutes left. Let me spend 10 minutes showing you the platform and then we could discuss a little bit further with the remaining time. Okay, fantastic. Give me one second just to get my demo environment going. Can you see my screen here?
wgrantsynn: Yes, I can.
Jacob Greenberg: And William, Is it William or Will? Which do you prefer?
wgrantsynn: William?
Jacob Greenberg: William. Great. Okay, great. So I'm just going to walk you through top down here. You'll see a summary tab, a transaction tab, a get paid tab which is for accounts receivable, and a bill paid tab which is for accounts payable. This is going to be an easy way to coordinate both your AP and AR in a singular location where you could download all of your transaction records from one place. So the transaction tab is going to be a high level overview of every transaction that you guys have had and it's exportable by csp. If you want to be able to export and import into an accounting system like great plans. On the other hand, we also make it very easy to reconcile these payments and take notes on them by simply clicking this button here and tagging if it's been reconciled or if it's flagged for whatever reason and adding a note. And this is all demonstrable in the CSV download. So it's Just easier to keep your ledgers clean, filter by anything like receivables or payables. And you're also able to put filters in based on the invoice or do you guys typically use invoice numbers for your transactions or purpose statements?
wgrantsynn: We do invoice numbers, so you'll be.
Jacob Greenberg: Able to look up by invoice number or by the customer you're doing business with or by specific date range. So it just makes it easy to see when that was processed, the amount, where it's going to and coming from invoice, and the status of that transaction. The real magic happens on the AR and AP side here and there's a couple things to show you. First and foremost, I'm not sure if this is going to be exciting to you or not, but this is more of an Easter egg that we have less of the nuts and bolts of the system. But once you sign up with Nickel, you get this payment portal here which is very customizable. You can add any type of field including document uploads. You can change the text for these fields or make this a multi page payment. But we have several customers that will embed a Pay now button on their website and it directs them to here where they're able to enter whatever information they're supposed to enter that you prompt them to you. And essentially they're being shown that they could pay by bank via ACH for free, or they're able to pay by card and incur the 2.99% fee on their own. Nicole is able to put the credit card rate on the customer in all 50 states in compliance with local and regional surcharging laws. So we take care of all of that. We manage the PCI compliance for storing your customer's private banking information so that that doesn't lay on your shoulders anymore. And we're also SOC 2 compliant, so this is just an easy form for them to go on your website. Click Pay and Pay on their own. So I'm not sure if this is something that you would want to integrate into your own system, but really the nuts and bolts of the invoicing itself happens from this page here. So when you go to create an invoice, since you guys are doing AR pretty infrequently, but they're larger scale transactions, just go ahead and click a new invoice you're able to, if you have previous existing customer data, you could send that information to us and we'll import it for you the first time. If you want to add new Customer information. You're always able to come in and add customers from the customer tab and from here you're going to be able to see their balance if they've been settled, how many invoices you've had, and just see the transaction record on a per customer basis. We also have a very easy workflow for you to request payment authorization from your customers so that you can ensure PCI compliance for those customers as well as. Here, give me one second here. I'm sorry, there was an alarm going off in the background and I got a little distracted.
wgrantsynn: You're fine.
Jacob Greenberg: So here on the customer tab, you'll be able to import all the customers you currently have. We also make it easy, as I was saying, for you to request the customer information in advance and have them authorize automatic payments. This way you can auto charge them for deposits or auto charge them for the remaining balance of a transaction once they authorize you to do so, so that you don't have to wait for checks or ACHS to come in. And I can show you what that workflow looks like. But before that, I'm just going to show you what this payment portal looks like. Very quickly. I'll put in a test. William, test here. I'm going to add my information so I can show you what the email notification looks like. We'll put in the invoice number and the transaction amount. One thing to note is nickel is free to get going on our nickel core plan. The only difference between nickel core and nickel plus is that on nickel core you're capped at $25,000 per transaction. You guys would most benefit from nickel plus, which is just $35 a month and has unlimited transaction amounts. So you could do 1 million, 2 million, 3 million. You set it for a one time or recurring invoice. You'll have the invoice date and the due date. Do you guys put net terms on your payments?
wgrantsynn: Yes.
Jacob Greenberg: Are they typically 30? 45 day?
wgrantsynn: Typically 30 to 40, 30 or 45 depending upon how the contract was negotiated.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. Do you ever have problem collecting within that due date range?
wgrantsynn: Depends upon the customer.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. So we do make it a little easier for you to do collections or just to set that net term agreement. You could put it here in the due date. You could add any additional information or notes for the customer here. And on the invoice level itself you're actually able. I have a sample invoice. It's just for some reason always the hardest thing for me to find on my laptop. You're actually able to add any documents you want to the individual transaction itself. So whether that is the netterm agreements, photos of the job site, overall contracts, line item invoices that you generated from another system, you're able to put it here so it's always permanently accessible and visible between you and the customer to reduce back and forth communications. Before I create this and send it, I'm going to show you some of the advanced settings you can disable credit card payments if you would like. However, most of our customers keep it enabled because it's pretty much providing your customer with the option to pay by credit card or to pay by ach and is very visible that if they elect to pay by ach, it's completely free. And if they elect to pay by credit card, they will incur a credit card fee. And you can pass either all of that fee onto the customer or you can share the fee with the customer if you choose to split it. Some of our larger manufacturers or distributors have custom agreements with other manufacturers or distributors, so they might do 5050 split, but for the most part the majority of our customers will put 100% of the fee onto their customers. But you do have the ability to disable card payments if you'd like. And I'm going to create this invoice now. If you have their information already uploaded, you could just go ahead and schedule the charge so it automatically charges on the date. Or you could send the invoice for them to pay at their convenience. And you can send this via email or via text message phone number. So I'm going to send this link now and show you what it looks like. Our demo environment has a dummy name of Degrad Distribution. So this will be your company name, whether HDD or crossing. Let's say they have a new payment request. You know William requested a new payment. It'll have the amount, the due date, and some basic information here about the invoice number and any additional information you want to add. All of the attachments will be automatically included within the email, but when they click Pay now, they'll also be visible from within the invoice. So this will be your invoice. It will have your branded logo, contact information, any of the documents that is corresponding with this individual transaction, any additional notes if this customer has had previous transactions with you, it will actually show and populate beneath this tab here on the payment amount, all their historic transactions or outstanding invoices. So they have a record. As I was saying before, they're able to click Pay by bank so that they could see that they're paying this $1 million transaction with no fees whatsoever. They could enter this banking information and click Pay. If they paid with you before, they can elect to store this banking information for future projects so they don't have to enter in multiple times. We're also unrolling Apple Pay shortly as an option. They could also elect if they'd like to pay by card. They'll see that it incurs a 29 or 2.99%, excuse me, additional fee that will go on them. So if they like to have that cash flow advantage of being able to pay off their card faster than the 30 day net terms that they've been offered, they can elect to pay by card. We've actually found that for larger transactions, companies like yours that have million plus transactions about 22% of the time, their customers prefer to pay by card for that cash flow advantage. And Most places have 2 to 3% cash back cards at this point anyway. So they are willing to accept the fees in exchange for a better cash flow on their end. However, customers are also able and this is up to you, you can turn this feature on or off. They're also able to edit the payment amount. So if they wanted to pay half of it by credit card and half of it by ach, they're able to do so as well. Okay, it's that straightforward. And then once they pay back here, on your invoices tab, we'll move from active into the completed section here. You'll be able to see all of the completed transactions and if there's anything remaining. So for example, Ray made a payment of $0.50 on a $1 transaction and you'll see that it's marked as overdue. So you could send a reminder to him very easily by just clicking Send reminder right here. And if you had multiple invoices to send out, you could just click unset invoices, select all of them and send the payment request for all those invoices automatically. So it just makes it easier for you to be able to track these invoices. Provide a better customer experience. Enable the option to get paid by credit card, which creates cash flow advantages for both yourself and for your customers, but without creating any additional fees for your business. The other benefit of this is the settlements are one to one settlements within your bank. So you won't see a million dollar transaction broken up into 10 different settlements. It'll just be a million dollar individual settlement in your bank account. So I know you guys do make more payments via AP than you accept payments via ar. Before I move into the AP side, do you have any questions regarding the AR process right here? I know I'm talking very fast and moving through very quickly, so I wanted to pause and see if you have any input here.
wgrantsynn: No, I'm, I'm. I'll keep it up.
Jacob Greenberg: Do you think so far this is something that might be impactful for your business? Is there any aspect of this that. Would be a net benefit?
wgrantsynn: I'm not really seeing it yet, to be honest.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. What are your thoughts so far for ar?
wgrantsynn: The volume of AR is so low that us handling it the way we are, it's just, it's efficient.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. Do you think that there would be a benefit for enabling your customers to have the option to pay by card or for you guys to accept card without incurring any transaction fees?
wgrantsynn: I don't see that as being appealing to our customers.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha.
wgrantsynn: Because especially since the fee would be on them entirely, I don't see them picking that as an option.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. I know that you're accepting check ach credit card. Is just having it all in one singular portal beneficial whatsoever?
wgrantsynn: Well, that might be helpful, yes.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. What type? I know you said it might be helpful for you. What are you thinking as far as impact? Like, why would that benefit you guys?
wgrantsynn: When it came to reaching out to our customers to. To work on any collections, it would be convenient for my district controller to be able to go there to do that.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. Okay, great. And I know we're coming up on time a little bit here, but we also have the bill pay to discuss from a high level. Before I hop into bill pay, do you think that having AR and AP all visible in a singular location would have any convenience benefit for you guys?
wgrantsynn: Not necessarily, because we. It's two different. Two different departments.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. So one thing that we can do is we could segment your members based on their roles and position so you can give them certain access and certain permission to different parts of the portal. If you did want to have one for ar, one for AP and then have somebody else managing all of it with visibility and have approval over everything, you can set up those customer permissions as well.
wgrantsynn: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: Now, on the AP side, it's quite similar to the AR side as far as when you create a new bill, you update all of your vendors. You could add new vendor information. We can store all of your vendor information in a PCI compliant and SoC2 compliant way so that you guys are no longer liable for the PCI compliance of it and you're able to make those payments directly from here. So I'll select something right here, add the payment amount, any reason for payment, so whether it's materials or rent, due date and any additional documents and then you're able to just make a payment and it will automatically go through. Then it will be showing here on your queued for payment or paid in full tabs. Once it's fully processed and with Nickel plus there's a two day business turnaround for ACH and a next day business turnaround for credit cards. You set up recurring bills as well so that you can see easily all of the recurring bills that you have. For example, this One is a $1 monthly recurring bill and you can make edits and update this based on delivery method, how you like to pay and how frequently it's being paid. That's just an easy place to be able to send out all these transactions in the unified portal and track all of them individually on your ledger. This approvals tab is more what I was referring to. This is also manager level. So if you had a manager sending out payments and you wanted an admin to be able to approve them whether they're above a certain size or to a certain customer, you could put in that manual approval process. But this is all hyper customizable and specified to whatever your unique workflow is. But ultimately the plan here is to help companies that are very check heavy businesses have an easier transition to being able to process ACH or credit card transactions. So digital transactions in general providing the utmost customizability to their customers so that they can choose to pay how they prefer to pay without it taking any impact on your business's settlement times or fees. So we will remove all those fees for you and also just makes it easy to track these ledgers and maybe save time on any of the manual process you have for reconciliation for tracking for collecting payments. I know you guys currently work with the banks right now to do that ach when you're receiving checks for AR or receiving ACH for ar. When you go to make that deposit in your bank, do you need a specific individual to go in and handle those deposits and make sure that they're reconciled or does everybody in your organization have access to that?
wgrantsynn: Multiple people have access to it.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, gotcha. So this isn't again, we often have customers that are very check heavy and they don't have the ability to, you know, reconcile that with the bank account unless the CEO or the bank name holder isn't available to Do. So this opens up that door so that other people can be able to make sure that payments are getting processed and Right. This is all to the payments portal here. Do you think? I know that you said one of the heightened things that you think would be impactful for you guys is to be able to have the unique payments portal going out to your customers or to have a payment portal embedded on your website for better presentation. Do you see how nickl might be able to help the transfer from collecting checks to ACH a little bit smoother for you and your customers?
wgrantsynn: Possibly, yes.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. And I know I like sped talk through our half hour here and there was a lot to cover and we only have two minutes left. So I know that you could possibly see this being impactful for you guys. I wanted to know what you would think would be the best next steps for for this conversation.
wgrantsynn: I will run this by my supervisor who's up in Canada and see how he feels about it. I'm not overly optimistic that he's going to accept it, but I wanted to see what the options were and I was thinking might be more AP oriented, but I think your focus is broad accounts receivable and I don't see it playing a big part with accounts receivable for us.
Jacob Greenberg: For accounts payable, we're definitely equally focused on both. Most companies that come to us asking for support come in on the AR side because they have bad cash flow because they're accepting a lot of checks.
wgrantsynn: Yep.
Jacob Greenberg: Most of the conversations we're having are around ar, but our AP and AR functionality are built out to spec on both sides equally. Right. But yeah, the reason I brought that up is just a lot of the people that come inbound are like, hey, I'm paying a lot for these AR credit card or I'm carrying around these checks for a long time and I don't have an easy way to transition our customers over to ach.
wgrantsynn: Right.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. So I know that you want to show this to somebody else on your team to get their approval. Understanding that you guys and I don't always do this, but I know you guys are pretty much identical to a lot of the best customers that we work with as far as the industry that you're working in and the volume that you guys typically do. So if you guys would like, it's definitely easier to see all these things in the different demo environment. I would be happy to set up time to walk through anybody else you'd like on a similar demo to this one so that I can Answer any questions they might have about custom integrations, potentially building out an integration for you guys with great planes. So that is an automatic sync. And there's no additional steps or just to walk through, like the grand plan you guys have for transferring people over from check to ACH and see where we might be able to come in. I'm happy to set up that time to schedule, you know, another walkthrough with whoever needs eyes on it.
wgrantsynn: Okay, I'll extend that offer.
Jacob Greenberg: So is there any information or resource that you need from me to be able to set up that additional demonstration call?
wgrantsynn: Not at this time.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. Should I put some time on our calendar? Just. It could be a pivot for a check in to see how that conversation went. I guess my question here is how much time do you think it would need for you to have that internal conversation? So I'm not bugging you.
wgrantsynn: In the interim, call me back on the 30th.
Jacob Greenberg: The 30th of this month?
wgrantsynn: Yes.
Jacob Greenberg: Great. So the 30th of this month is next Tuesday. I'm just going to throw something on the calendar as a reminder for us to touch base, if that's all right. I would hate to, like, interrupt the middle of your day and. Or forget on my own, so.
wgrantsynn: All right.
Jacob Greenberg: Right now it's. We had our call at 3. Is it okay if I throw something on the calendar for the same time to give you a call back?
wgrantsynn: That'd be fine.
Jacob Greenberg: All right. William, I'm really happy we connected today, made some time to talk. If you have any request for information in the meantime, to make it clearer how Nicole can support your business and the exact features that we can so that you could present it to anybody on your team, please don't hesitate to reach out. I'll be happy to share some resources with you.
wgrantsynn: Sounds good. Thank you.
Jacob Greenberg: All right. You got it. Have a good rest of your day.
wgrantsynn: You do.
