Matt Bartini - Mayor Clothing: Hello? Hello? It.
Jacob Greenberg: Hello? Hello?
Matt Bartini - Mayor Clothing: Jacob, it.
Jacob Greenberg: Hey Matt, can you hear me?
Matt Bartini - Mayor Clothing: Hey, how are you?
Jacob Greenberg: Good. Sorry for running three minutes late here. I was just hopping off another call.
Matt Bartini - Mayor Clothing: No problem. Thanks for the time. Yeah, of course.
Jacob Greenberg: Thanks for yours. So, yeah, I know you reached out via LinkedIn. You're looking for a little bit of a relief from QuickBooks Payments. Would you give me some? I have half an hour on the calendar here before we get started. Does that still work for you?
Matt Bartini - Mayor Clothing: Definitely, yeah. Okay, great.
Jacob Greenberg: So before we hop into it too much, would you give me a little bit of background on your clothing company?
Matt Bartini - Mayor Clothing: Yeah. So we're doing B2B so all wholesale to private country clubs. So the basic average customer is just your local private country club in the suburbs and we sell them custom print polos. And I am looking for a way to replace paper checks which I've done for a while and use some other services. But my main need is ach. They're going to pay by ach. If they send a check, that's fine. That has nothing to do with you guys. And if they say pay by card they're paying a fee anyway, so I don't really care what it is. So I guess the main need is, what I'm looking for is an achievement as cheap as possible with obviously like a secure way to get the money back and forth. So I saw you all have free ACHs and that seems awesome but honestly like too good to be true. So I was just wondering what the deal was.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, it's not. So I'm going to ask a couple more questions to make sure that we're compatible here and that we can actually support you guys the way you want to do it. But I'll give you some background about nickel before I hop in too much. Initially we are developed for what we call the built world industries, so contracting and construction because these are companies that have pretty significant cash flow troubles and are very check heavy. So we are built to be able to quickly and easily transition companies that are check heavy to doing achievements doing credit card processing and also to be able to handle larger transactions. So a lot of the ACH payment providers will take a smaller, a large transaction of like 50k or 100k and break it up into a bunch of different deposits in your bank account for batch processing. We can do one to one in the process of creating the solution to cause cash flow advantage for these businesses. We also realized we could develop technology that makes ACH transfers much cheaper and we're able to offer that to our customers for Free because what we found is between 17 and 22% of the time their customers opt to pay in credit card because of the cash flow advantage that it provides. Now when your customers pay you guys in credit card, the fee is taken by nickel. So right now that's our revenue stream and it affords us the ability to offer free achievement.
Matt Bartini - Mayor Clothing: So you have, I guess you have a fair amount of credit card business to support the ach.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, we do. And also in the future we're looking to do some more, offer some more products at cost. So we are coming out with trade credit features, we're coming out with other things that are going to improve cash flow for businesses that are all opt in. So we're using free ACH because we have the ability to do it. Our model supports it and it's kind of like our version of the Costco hot dog. So yeah, gotcha.
Matt Bartini - Mayor Clothing: Makes sense. And is it, I mean, sending invoices and rocket science, is it as simple as QuickBooks makes it just do you.
Jacob Greenberg: Guys use line items for your accounting and like are you sending out from QuickBooks Pay?
Matt Bartini - Mayor Clothing: I have really, I've just been doing PDFs and then I don't we mention QuickBooks because I got, you know, God, I do use them for, for my books and you know, I thought had a misunderstanding with how much the ACH was. So I only did it once and they charged me and I'm like, they clearly just don't give a at all. So I'm not doing this.
Jacob Greenberg: It's also, yeah, their prices have been going up a lot this year as they make a transition to get everyone from QuickBooks Desktop to QuickBooks Online by 20. They're simultaneously increasing ACH rates.
Matt Bartini - Mayor Clothing: Totally. And I understand why people would do that, but I'm not doing that. So with the ACH, my numbers would be at least, you know, $1,500. Let me think. Yeah. 20. Yeah. Thousand. $1500 minimum. All the way to tens of thousands. You know, 10, 20, $30,000. And it sounds like that's smaller for you guys if you're used to dealing with contractors. So all those numbers are good. Right.
Jacob Greenberg: And I'm going to pop inside our demo environment in a second. But before I do, I'll show you our pricing page just so that you have an understanding of what we're talking about.
Matt Bartini - Mayor Clothing: Perfect.
Jacob Greenberg: Can you see my page here?
Matt Bartini - Mayor Clothing: Yep.
Jacob Greenberg: Awesome. So, yep. You can sign up today after this call if you'd like, with Nickel core or with Nickel plus, it really just takes a second to get activated. Very light implementation and you'll understand at the end of this call what I mean by that. Nickel Core is free and you can upgrade at any point to the 35amonth nickel plus plan. The difference is Nickel Core has a maximum of $25,000 per transaction, whereas Nickel plus has no hard transaction limit whatsoever. We're able to manage multi million dollar individual transactions on a one to one settlement ratio. So we call it industrial strength payment security. The difference as well in the time settlement is there's going to be a three day business turnaround for Nickel Core and a two day turnaround for Nickel Plus. For Nickel Core on credit card, it's a two day turnaround and for Nickel plus it's the next day turnaround. So just one day quicker for Nickel plus as well.
Matt Bartini - Mayor Clothing: For sure.
Jacob Greenberg: You're also going to be able to do things like recurring payments if you want to be charging recurring payments. And you can add an unlimited amount of users or schedule payments in advance. So if you do have the odd transaction that's going to break out over 25,000 or 30,000, you might want to go with Nickel Plus.
Matt Bartini - Mayor Clothing: Not yet, but that seems reasonable.
Jacob Greenberg: Whenever you need to. Typically, people start with doing some smaller transactions, getting familiar and comfortable with the platform. When they're ready to do a larger one, they just pop into the portal, into their app and upgrade on their own.
Matt Bartini - Mayor Clothing: Awesome.
Jacob Greenberg: So.
Matt Bartini - Mayor Clothing: So I can send out and I guess, yeah, you, you gotta show me the demo, but send out an invoice from your platform. Pretty easy.
Jacob Greenberg: Yep, I'll walk you through that in one second here. Let me get that loaded for you. My demo environment. Give me one sec.
Matt Bartini - Mayor Clothing: Sure.
Jacob Greenberg: While I do that, can you tell me like how many transactions you're typically looking at processing in a given week?
Matt Bartini - Mayor Clothing: You know, at least for now. Just a couple times a week. Yeah, hopefully definitely more in the future, but really a couple thousand bucks couple times a week. Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: So looking at like 2,000 to 3,000 on a weekly basis.
Matt Bartini - Mayor Clothing: The amounts could definitely vary and be higher for sure. But nothing over. I'm not anticipating anything over 25 just yet. Our model is kind of, you know, we can do lower minimums with our customers. They can buy like 25 units from us and do that several times over the course of a year instead of like 100 or 200 all at once. So that helps us compete as a smaller company, so smaller transactions. Cool.
Jacob Greenberg: So yeah, getting started with nickel, super easy. I think it's going to really fit your use case really well. I'll give You a quick walkthrough. Once you create your account and you log in, you'll see this page here. First thing I do is go to Account Settings. You're going to be prompted when you log in to sync your bank account. And then if you need to access your paid plan to upgrade, you click on this plan button here. Under General, you'd update your logo and any color coding and banner that you want to update to make sure it's on brand for you and your customers. But the first thing I do is go to Integrations and link your QuickBooks account. Now, depending on how much information you have in QuickBooks, this could take anywhere between like three to six minutes. But once it's synced the first time, it's going to be an automatic two way sync. So every time you receive a payment or send out a payment from Nickel, it's going to automatically reconcile that for you. In QuickBooks or if you're currently creating your invoices in QuickBooks, you don't change that process whatsoever. You'll create the invoice in QuickBooks, it will automatically populate. In Nickel, it will include the PDF invoice with line items automatically. And you'll just hop into that invoice and click request payment. Very, very easy.
Matt Bartini - Mayor Clothing: And I could send that as a link in an email to a customer.
Jacob Greenberg: Exactly. So I'm going to take one quick step back before I dive into it. Just so I. So you know, that's how the QuickBooks integration would work. On the transaction tab, you'll be able to manage all of your transactions, whether they're receivables or payables, very quickly. And you're also going to see historic transactions here. This you can not only auto sync with QuickBooks, but if you want to, you could download as a CSV. It also makes it really easy to search. So we have. QuickBooks is a great tool for holistic account keeping. It gets a little bit cluttered sometimes and it's hard to find unique transactions. We make it very, very easy just to manage the money flow of your business.
Matt Bartini - Mayor Clothing: Perfect. This should be pretty simple.
Jacob Greenberg: I mean, yeah, it's very straightforward.
Matt Bartini - Mayor Clothing: Not that many invoices for me. You know, a couple times a week isn't too much to keep track of. Do I get an alert when I get paid?
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, great question. So come into account settings. You click on notifications in here, you'd be able to manage all the different notifications that you would have for your, you know, making payments. So when a payment is made to you you can toggle this on or off. You can get alerts to specific emails if you want to. If it's been failed, if it's been finally processed, if there's been a refund, if there's been a payout, you can do all of that. Customers, you can also customize their notifications as well as for bill pay. Notifications.
Matt Bartini - Mayor Clothing: Right? Usually yeah. My use case is I'm already emailing with customers. I'm just putting the link in there. Please pay this. That's it.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha.
Matt Bartini - Mayor Clothing: I like to get an alert when you know, they pay it so I don't have to keep checking. So it sounds like I can. But yeah, I keep it pretty simple.
Jacob Greenberg: Perfect. I'm going to walk through the creation of a new invoice just to show you what it looks like inside Nickel but it sounds like for your use case you'll be creating the invoices within QuickBooks and just coming here and clicking Send.
Matt Bartini - Mayor Clothing: So it doesn't matter either way, right?
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, it doesn't matter either way. I think for you, if you're already used to doing it within QuickBooks, go ahead and keep doing it, but it's totally up to you. So I'm just going to put my email address in here so that I can show you what it looks like to receive one of these. Put in the invoice number and the invoice amount you put any notes for customers, go here and you can make this a one time or a recurring invoice if you want to. Recurring invoice, you'd be able to choose the cadence, monthly, weekly or annually, start date and the end date. But for one time payments you'll be able to choose the invoice date that's created. And if you have Net terms agreements with your customers, you you would update the due date to be the date of that netterm agreement. If I want to, I can include a netterm agreement attached here and just type in the note for customer seeing Net terms attached in here in the upload documents. Once you create an invoice from QuickBooks, the PDF line item invoice that you created from QuickBooks will automatically be attached here. But you could upload anything else that you want including Net terms agreements, photos of the product packed and shipped, any other agreements that you might have with that customer so that you can consolidate the back and forth communication in a singular portal that is able to be accessed at any point, at any time and be branded for your company.
Matt Bartini - Mayor Clothing: Perfect. Very similar to QuickBooks I imagine. Yep.
Jacob Greenberg: And here in the advanced tab, you're going to be able to do a couple things like enable the customer to edit the payment amount. So if they want to make a deposit on one full invoice, they can. Or if they just want to split the cost between credit card and ach, they're able to do so without you incurring any additional fees or delays in payment. So it's really just optimizing for the customer's preference without it taking any negative impact on your business.
Matt Bartini - Mayor Clothing: So can I set it where ACH is? It's free anyway. Can I set it where they pay if they can use card if they want, but they pay the fee.
Jacob Greenberg: Exactly. That's going to be the default actually. Now some customizations you can make is right now it's defaulted. So 100% of the fees on the customer for credit card. If you do have a unique agreement where a customer strongly prefers credit card, you could change the percentage to 50% and you could split it half and half with your customer, the credit card fee. But nine times out of 10 people use nickel to put 100% of the fee on the customer.
Matt Bartini - Mayor Clothing: Yep.
Jacob Greenberg: Because they have the option to pay with credit card or with ach. I'm going to go ahead and just create this invoice here and we have a couple options. At this stage you're able to put in the email address or the phone number so that you could text or email the customer this invoice, which I will do and show you what it looks like. But also here you'll see you'll be able to charge the payment method on file if you already have that customer information. So you're able to just enter that customer information here. Or if you import it from QuickBooks and you have an authorization form, you're able to just come in here and click Schedule charge. And on the schedule charge date it will auto withdraw from. Now we're just going to send an invoice link to my email here. Ignore my busy email inbox and we'll see here the degrad distribution, which is our dummy company name and our demo environment. This is the number of the invoice. All the attachments are below and you'll see your logo and your company name right here. And if you click it, it goes straight to your website so you have a new payment request. It'll show the amount of the payment, it'll show the invoice number, it'll show any memos that you put when you click pay. Now this is what that invoice looks like your company logo right here. Your name and email address, any documents associated with the transaction beneath the payment amount section here. You actually will. If there's been previous transactions with this customer, their previous invoice records will show here so that they can see if they have anything outstanding. And the high level thing here is that Pay by Bank ACH is completely free, no fees and 2.99% fee is automatically included in the pay by card option. You'll see it updated here and you don't have to account for that. That's going to come out of the customer's pocket, not out of your business's pocket.
Matt Bartini - Mayor Clothing: If they elect Amex to Visa, Visa, MasterCard and Amex.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, Every single card has the same rate.
Matt Bartini - Mayor Clothing: Perfect. Awesome.
Jacob Greenberg: And it's that simple. Once the payment is made under the invoices tab here, that payment will move to paid and you'll be able to see it's paid in full.
Matt Bartini - Mayor Clothing: Easy. How long have you guys been around?
Jacob Greenberg: Run around for I believe five years now, maybe six. Pretty young company but you know, we have tens of thousands of customers primarily in the contracting construction space but we're growing pretty quickly in other spaces as well.
Matt Bartini - Mayor Clothing: Yeah, I mean I just kind of delved into this whole thing. I used to work with another company that, that handled all of this stuff and the free ACH sure stand free ACH on a no monthly fee. I didn't find anyone else who offered that.
Jacob Greenberg: I don't think there is anyone else.
Matt Bartini - Mayor Clothing: Good for you guys. Yeah, I guess it works if you get enough people to pay by card.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah. And I think you know our for us really, when it comes to large construction and contracting projects where there is a big cash flow issue, credit card is a preferred method of payment for large transactions.
Matt Bartini - Mayor Clothing: The only other thing I can think of is any issues with security or anything like that.
Jacob Greenberg: Great question.
Matt Bartini - Mayor Clothing: With ach.
Jacob Greenberg: So we actually have incredibly strong security. Best in class. And there's a lot. Excuse me. There's a lot of details that you could see on this page here if you wanted to check it out on your own. It's got nickel.com backslash security and we're very transparent about how this entire process works. You can see how we move the money and you could read a little bit about how we're SOC2 compliant, PCI compliant and FDIC insured. But this is a great page to check out if you want to review a little bit more.
Matt Bartini - Mayor Clothing: Awesome.
Jacob Greenberg: One thing about nickel that I would highlight on the security front is one reason we are Able to such reliably offer free ACH on a no month plan is we do have heightened security for the customers that we have that use our platform. So we have maybe one or two additional security and verification steps than typical other processors do. And by ensuring that security on our platform we're able to provide better service and better pricing than competitors.
Matt Bartini - Mayor Clothing: Got it. I've just got one more question for you.
Jacob Greenberg: You got it.
Matt Bartini - Mayor Clothing: But I am going to sign up and appreciate the demo.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, of course.
Matt Bartini - Mayor Clothing: Makes total sense. I am. What am I using? So the other part of my business, I am buying my. The goods that I'm selling, I'm getting them made in Thailand, just polo shirts and getting them made and then I pay my manufacturer in Thailand on a monthly basis. So that's probably a little bit higher transaction amounts but probably still not quite over 25,000. So probably the same scenario. I'm wondering if like. Because what I'm currently doing is I'm using. God, I just started using it. Bear with me for a second. What the hell is this one? You know there's a million of these things I'm using Wise.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, gotcha.
Matt Bartini - Mayor Clothing: Yeah, so I use Wise. There's the lowest fees I can could find. It's really not too much. But I'm wondering if you have a use case for that. Better use case than what I'm doing with Wiser. If I should just keep doing that.
Jacob Greenberg: I'd say for now continue to use Wise for your international payments of that transaction size and then I believe that we might be able to support that for you. I'm just going to double check on it before I give you absolute.
Matt Bartini - Mayor Clothing: Sure. Appreciate it.
Jacob Greenberg: You got it.
Matt Bartini - Mayor Clothing: But as far as you know, Wise is the best. Is that the best? Lowest fee, good security? Ach. I can do internationally.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, I think Wise is really a good industry standard for international payments.
Matt Bartini - Mayor Clothing: Secure. Awesome. Perfect. Would love to do you guys if you had, you know, a better option. But it is working. So yeah, that's all I've got.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, sounds good. Right Matt? Well, I'm happy that we could have made time today to connect. So you plan on setting up account sometime this week or next week?
Matt Bartini - Mayor Clothing: Yeah, I'll set it up. Between now and next weekend I will start doing like I did this one payment with QuickBooks. They charged me. They weren't going to charge me, they charged me. It was a small payment so it wasn't a big deal. So now I'm gonna use you. Nice.
Jacob Greenberg: Sounds good. So if you'd like I could check in with you sometime next week, see how the process goes for you. And if you have any questions in the meantime, please don't hesitate to reach out. You have my email and the calendar invite here. It's JacobNickel.com.
Matt Bartini - Mayor Clothing: Appreciate it. Thanks again for the demo. And yeah, I'm excited that it's not too good to be true, so I will give it a try.
Jacob Greenberg: Sweet. All right, well, let me know what you think of it. And if you need any additional support, please don't hesitate to reach out.
Matt Bartini - Mayor Clothing: Thanks, Jacob. You too. Bye. Bye.
