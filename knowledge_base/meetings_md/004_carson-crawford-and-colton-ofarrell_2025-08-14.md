Colton O'Farrell: Hey Carson. See, can you hear me okay?
Carson Crawford: I can hear you perfect.
Colton O'Farrell: I can hear you all right as well. Just FYI, if there's any background noise, I am in a little cafe here, but happy that we could spend some time to jump on this call. I sent over an email earlier. Did you get a chance to review that in the demo?
Carson Crawford: Yes, I did look at the demo. I haven't been able to go online and create an account or anything. Today has not been that great of a day to... Yeah, no worries. Something like that. I guess one question I have is, do we have to be on the I can't think of the platform it was.
Colton O'Farrell: Vlad?
Carson Crawford: I'm sorry, I'm trying to think of the one y'all sync with. Do you have to be with QuickBooks?
Colton O'Farrell: QuickBooks Online? Yeah.
Carson Crawford: Do you have to sync with that?
Colton O'Farrell: No, you don't have to. That is, we have a native integration with them, so it's just to sync information from those two systems. But what are you operating on today, or is it more so.
Carson Crawford: We are Homeowners Association. We do have TOPS today.
Colton O'Farrell: Can you download like a CSV file from that?
Carson Crawford: Yes, yeah. One thing that we're having issues with is TOPS uses a thing called ZAGO. And what they do, they charge almost 4% on credit cards and then $3.95 per ACH. because we're, we're wanting to go to more of, like, a, I want to call it like a pay as you go, but we're giving our homeowners an option, like, hey, we don't care if you make one payment. We don't care if you make 12 payments. We don't care if you make 52 payments. We just, we don't care. So what we were trying to do is find a cheaper option for our our residents and basically if we could if you know in the long run if it did cost again it wouldn't cost the association but it would cost the homeowner if we had to. But I did notice that you guys offered a free ACH which I think is more online of what our board wants.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep. Yeah we sure do. I'm happy to go through kind of the pricing and plan options. If If that makes the most sense here, it sounds like you were able to watch some of the video. Yes. So you got to see some of the general workflows. So just to expand upon some of the aspects that were in that video, yes, you could, well, for kind of your use case, if you could download that CSV file from TOPS or the system that you're using there, get that system over to our support team, at least to set up the account, we would be able to add all the homeowners, Or are you classifying them as like vendors on your side or how is it kind of looking the systems you're using?
Carson Crawford: Well, the system, well, it's one system that we use right now. It's basically the accounting system and, you know, violations and all that kind of stuff. So in the loop.
Colton O'Farrell: Are they inputted as customers then?
Carson Crawford: I would say probably more so as a customer.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah. So it should be pretty easy. You just get us over a CSV file. We would just do the mapping to get it added to your account. Once it's added, you'd be able to create and send those invoices directly from Nickel. You could send those via text or via email to your customers. If you have any attachments that you want from your previous system, you could download those. You could upload them yourself and attach those. We also have a branded payment portal link that can be embedded in your website.
Carson Crawford: Did you get a chance to see that? Yeah, I saw that. And that would be something we would like, you know, that something that, you know, they just go click, hey, go click payments and be done with it.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, they could just come to your website, go in there, make any kind of ACH payment where there'd be no fee whatsoever. Or if they want to use a credit card, maybe for they want some credit card points or whatever their They rationale would be charged a is, they'd 2.99% be able to do fee that. and that would be 100% paid for by the homeowner unless you wanted to change that, in which case you could adjust those rules to be whatever kind of percentage you'd want. But again, by default, it's 100% to be paid for by them.
Carson Crawford: Okay, so as far as the, like the file I would need to get to your team, what would they all need?
Colton O'Farrell: Just the standard CSV file of what you have for your accounting system today. your customers, the email addresses, just basic information of which you would to make your life easier when you're creating the invoices and sending them to the customer, whatever would be most helpful for you to have inputted into Nickel. You don't even need to do the CSV option. If it's easier just to go into Nickel and just add the vendors or the customers, homeowners in your case, add them in there manually. You can also do that too. so just whatever makes the most sense for you guys.
Carson Crawford: Well, it would probably make more sense to send y'all the file because we do currently have almost 2, 2500 residents. So, I mean, we're big enough. We're a big operation.
Colton O'Farrell: Well, I mean, if it's in a CS. Yeah, if it's in a CSV file, I mean, that might be easier, especially on your end. We could just literally drag and drop. We'd make sure all the, the mapping translations were matched up, so just. uploaded into the system. Curious. So you have, you know, 2500 homeowners. It sounds like you do have some that are wanting to make payments via credit card as well. Right. Currently today. What are you guys doing in terms of annual revenue and for the 2500 homes that are in this Association?
Carson Crawford: Well, right. Well, by our bylaws, we have to send them an invoice by mail. By mail. But we also. Yeah, by mail. But we also send by email. So regardless if you get it by email or not, you, you, you, you will get one by mail.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep.
Carson Crawford: But where the email is just an.
Colton O'Farrell: Option for them to, would be an option for them to make that payment immediately. And then that third option would be, let's just go to the website, can go in there and make the payment.
Carson Crawford: Right, right. And then, of course, you know, we do get some, you know, old school checks in the mail checks, you know, come out of the office and run checks by us and whatnot. But I, I really think that if we could get it to where it's a no call, that that would probably even stop the checks from coming in.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah.
Carson Crawford: And we're just trying to simplify those kind of things.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah. Improve cash flow. No, it makes perfect sense. And we could absolutely help with that.
Carson Crawford: So. Okay.
Colton O'Farrell: So with those 2500 homeowners, is the, the rate that they're paying, is it a yearly, like an annual fee?
Carson Crawford: Yeah, it's annual free.
Colton O'Farrell: And is it greater than or less than 25 000 for each?
Carson Crawford: Each one or for. Yeah, it's currently it's 1149.50 we're going up 10% probably by, you know, the next year. It's got to be passed by the board next week. But we, we've already kind of decided that this was gonna happen, unfortunately. But, yes, I mean, it's 1200 1200 bucks.
Colton O'Farrell: Okay. And so 1200 is sent to each of those 2500 vendors or customers. Correct. Got it. Cool. Yeah, well, it sounds like our free plan should also meet your needs. If you're not needing to schedule payments in advance on the platform or set up like automated recurring, those are plus features or paid for features. But if you want to use the free version, I can go ahead and kind of walk through the pricing if.
Carson Crawford: You haven't had a chance to see that yet. Okay, so leading into that, because more than likely we're going to want the.
Colton O'Farrell: Plus option where we can absolutely do plus. But what's kind of the rationale there?
Carson Crawford: Is it more of the recurring billing? and It's then the the pay recurring in future, because billing. again, what we're wanting to do, we're wanting to get them to where if they want to, they can pay us $1,200 a month or $100 a month, you know?
Colton O'Farrell: Oh, yeah.
Carson Crawford: So again, we really want them to budget. We don't want to budget for them, but we want them to have the option to budget. Yeah.
Colton O'Farrell: So, I mean, with the Plus Plan, you would get complete cost, like features that Nickel offers. So including with that, the, the payment portal, we would actually be able to, so the payment portal is right here. Are you able to see this screen as well?
Carson Crawford: Yes, I see it.
Colton O'Farrell: Yes, sir. Yeah, sorry, I'm just on my one laptop, so I'm not sure if I usually have a second screen, but you would actually have access to this portal here. Like I mentioned, you'd be able to embed this in your website. All of this is customizable here and on the Plus Plan, we can actually give you a custom URL and domain as well. So if you want this to be more something specific to the homeowners association, So you would we have can access absolutely to really everything do in that. the platform. There's no set limit for active users in the account with Plus. You can do transactions up to a million dollars per transaction. You can schedule payments in advance. You can do recurring payments in advance. Okay. And the ACH processing is sped up as well. So typically on the free plan, it's two to three day turnaround time so long as you get it sent before the cutoff time of our sponsor bank, which is 4:00 PM Eastern Standard Time. But with Plus, we actually speed that up. So it's generally same day to two day turnaround time to get that into your bank account.
Carson Crawford: All right, so it'd be $35 a month.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep. So this is the annual plan. So we either have $45 a month or we do annual billing for it breaks down to $35 a month. It's sent as a one-time $420 payment. One thing that might be interesting to you and the board, is we also have for every business that signs up, we have a referral bonus as well. So if you click into that when you have your account set up, you'll have your own referral link here. And if you get a new independent business on Nickel, you'll get a $250 referral bonus after the first transaction. If you have any accounting firm or bookkeeping firms, you know, we actually pay $750 once they've made 10 payments. So there's some information there. But essentially, if you get two businesses referred on the Nickel, that's $500, which, you know, for the $420 annual plan, that's basically a free year of Nickel plus an $80 cash incentive in your pocket as well. Okay.
Carson Crawford: Yeah, that really sounds like kind of what they're wanting.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah.
Carson Crawford: Yeah.
Colton O'Farrell: So. Yeah, I think, and there's just to clarify too, there's no hidden transactions, there's no per like usage charges. The only way you would pay anything greater than that cost is if you manually go in and change your invoice settings so that if someone pays with a card, you're splitting that cost. But by default, again, it's them to fully pay for or the only other way you would have a cost is if you are paying bills via Nickel and you're paying with a credit card. You could also pay bills with us. Okay, if you're if you use your bank and ACH, but if you use a credit card, there's again a 2.90% fee there that that whoever's paying would have incur that charge essentially. Okay, great. Wonderful. Yeah, I think I think that's all.
Carson Crawford: My questions Colton and I appreciate you. Yeah, absolutely.
Colton O'Farrell: So what I'll do is I'm going to send some additional resources. So I sent the demo video that might be helpful to share some of the highlights to the board. I'll also send our security and data privacy information. Just kind of a high level snapshot The money is you're moving is always yours. We're simply the payment processor. And while we're handling any of your funds, we're moving it through FDIC and insured accounts. We handle all the PCI compliance. So if anyone pays with a card, you're just simply gonna get that net amount. We'll get the card as a kind of our payment fee. We're compliant in all 50 states with credit card surcharging laws. We're SOC 2 compliant, so we're protecting all of your information, your customers' information, the homeowners and in we this case, protect everything with encryption and tokenization. So I'll send some of those resources for you. But if you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me. Otherwise, we do have built-in chat support as well. So you would just go to the Help Center and click that. It pops up a message that can be sent directly to a human on our team. They'll usually respond before 30 minutes. So we're pretty well known for our level of support. But if you have any questions, feel free to let me know and we're excited to support the Homeowners Association.
Carson Crawford: Okay, so, oh, I guess one important question.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, yeah, another question.
Carson Crawford: All right, so again is, well, all right, so as far as creating an invoice in your system, all right, would I have to do that manually per, Resident.
Colton O'Farrell: Would you have to manually what?
Carson Crawford: Like enter it per resident?
Colton O'Farrell: So if you have your invoices in a CSV, when you get that to our team, we could also upload those as well.
Carson Crawford: Okay.
Colton O'Farrell: But that would be kind of a one-time engagement just to get you started to get all the homeowners customers added, get all the invoices that exist today. And then after that standpoint, you would just be creating those within Nickel and setting up the recurring billing options sounds like the most kind of use case for you guys, either if it's once a one time annually or if it's, hey, we're gonna make a $100 payment every month so you could set it up on a per customer basis. Gotcha. Gotcha.
Carson Crawford: All right, thank you.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah.
Carson Crawford: Any other questions, Carson?
Colton O'Farrell: No, I think that's it for right now.
Carson Crawford: I'll probably think of something later, but if I do, I'll email you if that's okay.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, it sounds great. Well, I owe you an email. yeah. We're I'll excited get that over to to support you the right Homeowners away and Association. Let me know if anything comes up in the meantime, though. Wonderful. Thank you, Carlton. My pleasure. Yeah. Have a good one, Carson. Appreciate you. Bye-bye.
