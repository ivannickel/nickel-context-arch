Colton O'Farrell: For all of our customers across the board. So there's not really another company that does that. And a lot of those companies like build.com, Melio, even QuickBooks Online, they used to do that. And then about last September, they all changed and started charging. Are you guys getting like a 1% fee for that? 2%?
Mike Lovelady: Yeah.
Colton O'Farrell: 1%. Is that capped Mike or is it uncapped?
Mike Lovelady: I don't know.
Charissa Floresca: I think it's based in the client base. It's in the Biller Genie. We send it the QuickBooks, send the invoice to the Biller Genie and the Biller Genie will send it to the client. But for ACH, there's none, no fee. Only for they will be using a credit card.
Mike Lovelady: They're charging us the fee now. Teresa.
Charissa Floresca: Right now, yes, they are.
Mike Lovelady: Yeah, they are charging us for ACH. We're not charging the customer, but they are charging us. Right.
Charissa Floresca: Oh, okay.
Mike Lovelady: That just recently happened. Right.
Charissa Floresca: All right, Mike.
Colton O'Farrell: So, yeah, Mike, sorry about that. We were just kind of just learning a little bit more about kind of what the reason for the call was today, but just to introduce myself, my name is Colton. I'm a sales partner here at Nickel. My role is to really understand your business or businesses, what kind of solution you're looking for. I'm happy to walk you through Nickel, make it interactive. I could add you as a vendor, send you emails to show you what your customers would be seeing. And if you're open to it, I'm happy to send you $50 on this call just to show how easy it is to send or receive payments via Nickel. I got your note here, but was just curious to learn a little bit more about some of the problems that you're dealing with today. Curious how you found Nickel and what.
Mike Lovelady: Really got you to hop on this call. yeah. So our Benchmark contacted me and said that they were now having to charge ACH fees.
Colton O'Farrell: And what are they planning on charging you?
Mike Lovelady: One percent.
Colton O'Farrell: One percent for them, too.
Mike Lovelady: Yeah. And I think that started July 1st or something like that. Or maybe June 1st. Anyway, so we were looking at Solutions, and one of my business Partners came across you. I don't know how he found you. He probably just. did a Google search and saw that you offer free ACH, which I'm kind of wondering, well, how do you make any money if you're not charging anything?
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, great question. Happy to answer that for you. Yeah, like I was mentioning before, there's these other companies out there, Bill.com, Melio, QuickBooks Online that never used to charge for ACH or benchmark now as well. and then pretty much overnight their customers went from paying nothing to paying hundreds or thousands of dollars every month on fees just to simply get that money into their bank account. We have sponsorships. We have a sponsorship with our bank where we're able to just process on our end. It is we pay like a couple pennies per ACH that we're processing, but we do not push that to any of our customers. So even if we have customers who are on our completely free plan, which is the Nickel Core plan. We're not making any money off of them per se, but with the options available for your customers to pay. So if they want to pay via ACH, that's completely free. But if they want to pay via a credit card, there is a 2.99% fee that would be charged to your customer if that's how they want to pay. Nickel would make the proceeds from the 2.99% credit card fee. And with our data, I mean, we have over 10,000 Customers who use us for accounts payable, accounts receivable, or both, even for the customers who don't pay us anything, our data shows about 17% of their customers will pay invoices via credit card. So we will make money that way. And there's also kind of the network effect when you provide a really great solution that solves business pain, makes people happy, they're going to rave about it online, on reviews, referrals, and you just kind of have that network effect. And that's really where Nickel has become really successful with.
Mike Lovelady: Okay. And I looked through your documents, it didn't look like it's too hard. I guess on our side, we would have to remove Benchmark as the payment processor and then add you.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, we would essentially be taking over for Benchmark. You wouldn't have to change anything with QuickBooks Online. We actually have a native integration. So you could, I'm happy to just quickly show my screen here quick, just to kind of show you that aspect. All right, you want to just let me know if you can see this okay? Happy to zoom in too if needed.
Mike Lovelady: Yeah, you can see it.
Colton O'Farrell: Cool. Yeah, so this is Nickel. I wasn't sure, did you guys have a chance to go ahead and sign up your free account yet?
Mike Lovelady: I have not done that yet.
Colton O'Farrell: No worries. Well, that's all you'll need to do is sign up for your account. Once you create your account, the only thing you need to do in order to send or receive payments is to link a bank account. So you'll do that right here at the bottom to link out your payment method. But once your account's created, you've linked your payment method, you're good to start sending and receiving payments via Nickel. So how it would work with that integration is you'd simply just come to integrations right here. You'd this click would bring you this to green QuickBooks link QuickBooks page. You'd account button. select your company, or you'd sign in, select your company, select your chart of accounts. And once you do that, everything would flow from QuickBooks Online directly into Nickel. We'd separate it into accounts receivable here, as well as accounts payable here. All of your customers, all of your vendors, everything that is in QuickBooks will be brought over here so you won't have to worry about that. Once you're actually connected to QuickBooks, This is a demo account, so I don't actually have mine connected, but I do have a screenshot of what you would see. So once you do that integrations connection right here, you would see something that looks like this. It would show your company name, the QuickBooks number right there, and then there would be this bottom option for you to toggle. This is some automation that you can enable where whenever invoice is created in QuickBooks, Nickel would just automatically send it to your customers on your behalf to pay. And that way, if your customers decide to pay via ACH, you won't have to pay that 1% fee that QuickBooks or Benchmark would be charging you. The one caveat here where it's not good to have this automation toggled on is if you're generating an invoice and after it's been generated, you need to go through and make revisions or edits to it, because each time you make those changes, your customer would get an email for So each of for the some subsequent of our customers, changes. they generate an invoice one time, it's good to send, and they have this on. Others, they might need to go through review, make adjustments, and if they do that, they generally leave this off. But do you have any questions with that?
Mike Lovelady: No, I don't.
Charissa Floresca: Done so far?
Colton O'Farrell: Cool. Yeah, so once you have that connected, like I said, everything will flow into an accounts receivable perspective here. Nickel is very easy to use. So if you don't have that automation toggled on, you would simply just come over to this right-hand side where it says payment requests. You can click on whatever invoice you're looking to send. We'd send that this secure payment link right here, either via email or via phone number. You can send multiple invoices at one time. So you can send payment requests all at one time there. And I will just demonstrate for purposes you don't ever have to create an invoice in Nickel, but you do have the capability to do that. I'm just going to show you what it looks like to generate a live invoice from here and I'm going to send this off. Oh, actually, you know what? We can make this more interactive here. Mike, would you prefer I set up? Let me just grab what I have here. I'm going to add you as a customer just so you can see kind of what it would look like on your side. So let's go ahead and just add a new customer. Go to add Myra Staffing. And Mike, what would be the best email address to shoot over an email of what your customer would see?
Mike Lovelady: It would be Mike@myrastaffing.com Perfect.
Colton O'Farrell: Just wanted to confirm that. Awesome. So I'm going to go ahead and save this. Cool, you were added as a customer. I'm now going to issue just an invoice just to show you what that would look like here. Awesome. And we'll call this invoice 145-730-25. And for those invoice amounts, Mike, what is the typical range that you're dealing with?
Mike Lovelady: $800.
Colton O'Farrell: $800. And then you said, so most of the time, it sounds like most of what you're doing is recurring invoices twice a month for your customers?
Mike Lovelady: Well, they're recurring, but it's not the same amount every time.
Colton O'Farrell: Okay, got it.
Mike Lovelady: It really depends on, so we provide VAs to clients and it depends on how many hours the VA works. And so the invoices change from Right.
Colton O'Farrell: Based on the time. Got it. So, I mean, we do have the capability to do recurring, but generally those are better if they're static invoice amounts, otherwise the one time would work well here for you. But you could just put any kind of memo or notes. I'll say hi, Mike. Please make the payment as soon as possible. So when we are integrated with QuickBooks, we grab all of your invoices, attachments, PDF, every all of that flows over to Nickel so you don't have to about attaching those? Do you have a question?
Mike Lovelady: Yes. So for the note for the customer, can you we create a template where it automatically puts that in and put the customer's name in?
Colton O'Farrell: So I'm going to show you this is if you were looking to have a the the email that your customer will receive it's completely the the backdrop and everything. So having your logo, your name, everything will be customizable from that perspective. We do we don't have it set up so that this is just going to be a static note for your customer. I am happy to talk to the engineering team because I know we've added some field or like terms of service for specific customers that they have a unique business model. So I'm happy to ask about that. But once I send this to you, I think it will be helpful just to see what it looks like on your end. So I'm just going to attach a sample invoice. So this is not like a real invoice we generated. It's just one I grabbed off Google quickly to show you that you can attach any kind of invoice like so. But what I'm going to go ahead and do is hit create. We're going to send that to your email right there. While that's sending, it should just take a moment. I'm also going to copy and paste this link into a new browser just so you can see what it looks like from your customer perspective. So here's just me copying and pasting that link into a browser. So you'll say see your name, your email, the branded logo, invoice number, amount, there's that memo note right there. And here's the two options for your via customers ACH to pay. with So their if bank. they want There's to pay no fee that they just need to enter their routing and account number, hit pay, and that's simple as that. They want to pay via a credit card. There is a 2.99% fee that is by default 100% of the surcharge is your customer will pay for. We handle all the PCI compliance. So you're only going to get that $800 net amount. We would obviously get the 2392. But they would just enter their card information, hit pay and be completed that way. But if you want to go ahead and check your email, you should have.
Mike Lovelady: I did, I got it. And I clicked on pay invoice. I see my two options are paying.
Colton O'Farrell: Awesome. Yeah, and the nice thing is too, if your customer hits the reply all button on that email, you'll be automatically CC'd on any communication.
Charissa Floresca: How about for the O'Dea? Got it.
Colton O'Farrell: For what was that?
Charissa Floresca: Autopay, Autopay payment for the invoices. They have to set it up in the, in the nickel so that it cannot be paid manually by the client. Do you have an Autopay?
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, so you have like an, are you talking more about auto debit, like authorized from your customer's account? Yes, we can absolutely set that up. So do you have for all of your customers today?
Charissa Floresca: Yes, we do have it right now. All of them, at least 90% of our customers are in Autopay. It depends at they want to have it in the ACH or credit card. Some of our customers have it in credit card, some of our customers it's ACH.
Colton O'Farrell: The quick answer is yes, we absolutely can do that for you. I just would like some more information. So can you tell me, is that set up through QuickBooks today, like the payment authorization request or... No, in the.
Charissa Floresca: Invoicing portal in the BillerGenie, the one that who sent the invoice to the.
Colton O'Farrell: Client, so what is the financial institution that they're through? Or are they like electronic? Are they paper-based?
Charissa Floresca: The electronic, electronically online. And then the client will set it up, the bank details in the portal.
Mike Lovelady: Yeah.
Charissa Floresca: And then, yeah.
Mike Lovelady: Go ahead. It's kind of confusing how this works, Colton, because we create our invoices in QuickBooks. That goes to BillerGenie. Yeah, it's the benchmark to process the payments. And so if we can eliminate BillerGenie and benchmarks, yeah, we absolutely could. One application, that'd be kind of cool.
Colton O'Farrell: Well, the one, yeah, we absolutely could. The one thing I wanted to say is we do honor payment authorization forms from our customers if they've, you know, if you have a ton of customers who've already signed this.
Charissa Floresca: Yeah, correct. We can't always be right.
Mike Lovelady: Yeah.
Colton O'Farrell: The one caveat with that is it potentially can slow down payments because unfortunately, due to the world that we live in, it is not too challenging for fraudsters or scammers to just make fake payment authorization forms. So we have to have our compliance regulatory team just go through, make sure everything checks the box is there that of course it's used as intended. There's no kind of bad faith actors in there. So that's my only caveat is it potentially can slow down payments a little bit, but if you were looking to have it set up so that all of your customers, the nice thing is we can do that directly through Nickel. So when I was setting you up as a customer, Mike, I did not click on it, but what you would do simply is you go to new customer, I added your name, you would just hit this set up payment authorization request button here. When you hit save, So instead of you didn't get an email to be set up as a customer on my end. I just simply sent you the invoice. But if you were looking to get the debit authorization from your customers, you would simply click that button. Your customer, this is just another email box that I have. But your customer would receive an email that looks like this. So it would say payment authorization request from my demo account is to grab distribution. Yours would be Miro Staffing. You could have any kind of memo or notice in there. We do have some frequently asked questions with answers right there, but if it was too long and they didn't read that, they click the complete authorization form. We do have it again right on the second page. So it's letting them know that this authorization is for Myra Staffing to pull funds from their account based upon agreed upon criteria. When you're also setting up that payment authorization, you can set it up so that there's a specific transaction limit, There's a timeframe of when it will end, or you could have it be no limit, no timeframe of when it ends. This example won't have that. But this is letting them know that their information is protected. We're SOC 2 compliant. We use encryption, tokenization to protect their information. We're moving all the funds through FDIC insured account where the funds are always yours. We're simply the processor taking that getting it into your bank account. This is letting them know that this authorization authorization can be revoked at any time and that they can either pay via ACH or via credit slash debit card. So when all they'd have to do is go to get started here in this example, we don't have a transaction limit. We don't have an expiration date. But if you had those, they would populate maybe $25,000 there expires in a year. They would simply click those, click next step and say how they want to pay for that. So if they want to pay with their card to maybe get a 45 day float, Credit card points, they could do that. If they want to pay via ACH in their bank, they could do that with no fee. So that's what it would look like for setting that up and just being able to auto-debit and pull from your customers' accounts. Charissa, did that answer your questions regarding Nickel's capability there as well as Mike?
Mike Lovelady: Yeah.
Charissa Floresca: Well, all good.
Mike Lovelady: So the question is auto-pay. Where, where they set up for it. So when we invoice them, let's say five days after the invoice date, it automatically applies the ACH payment.
Colton O'Farrell: If you have this enabled, so if you have the auto pay enabled, so I'm going to just go to an invoice here. If I was to set up a.
Mike Lovelady: New one.
Colton O'Farrell: So with the auto-debit enabled, when that invoice is issued, we would just automatically pull from their account. So they wouldn't even have to set up any kind of autopay or anything. Once that invoice is sent out, you could schedule those to go out on the 15th and 30th, kind of your timeframe. But that would kind of be my recommendation. You just schedule payments to go out twice a month when they're looking to go out. the moment they're sent out, if they have given you that payment authorization form, we'll just automatically pull from their account.
Mike Lovelady: Okay, so Texas, we have to give them five days. So I noticed you could put the due date so we can. If the invoices is on the 15th, we can set the due date to the 20th.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, absolutely.
Mike Lovelady: And then all of pay would be on the 20th. Yep. Yep.
Colton O'Farrell: And I just, I wanted to let you know that we are compliant with all kind of. 50 states compliance regulations when it comes to credit card surcharging, ACH processing, all of that. Those kind of questions come up sometimes because a lot of companies can't really do it the way that we are set up and able to do it. But we are compliant in all 50 states. I do have this list right here as well of credit card like surcharge laws as well. So I'm happy to link any of this, but we do all meet all federal and jurisdiction requirements there from both ACH and a credit card standpoint.
Mike Lovelady: Okay. Can we set up two forms of payment, one bank and one credit card, and then have a default as a primary?
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, you can set up. So here's an example. What I'm going to go ahead and do.
Mike Lovelady: I mean, you had me set up so you could do that. Yeah. Yeah.
Colton O'Farrell: So this is on the accounts payable side. So I'm going to shoot you one more email here, Mike, if you don't mind. This is just to send you a quick Bill to kind of demonstrate how we can quickly and easily send money via nickel. So I'm going to go to oops, let's actually go to vendors first. So if you have your customers information, you could enter it in yourself. But if not, like, I don't have your information, I'm going to ask you to fill that out. So I'm just going to add.
Mike Lovelady: And.
Colton O'Farrell: Let me just grab the email. so we'd go ahead and hit invite there. You're going to get an email to fill out some information. And then once you go ahead and do that, I'm going to send you $50 via Nickel just to demonstrate how easy it is to send or receive payments via Nickel. But you should be getting that email in just a moment. And this is what your customer would receive if you were looking to pay them on the accounts payable side.
Mike Lovelady: Okay, but I saw that fill out vendor details. Oh, by the way, let's get started.
Colton O'Farrell: Charissa, do you have a question?
Charissa Floresca: Yeah, I have. I might. So I have a question for Colton. My question was, is in here, how could I. Should I invoice a client or create an invoice inside this, Nickel?
Colton O'Farrell: So you can continue to create invoices in QuickBooks. When you do that, all of your invoices are just going to automatically pull up right into here. So we'll grab your invoices from QuickBooks and then you would just come to this payment request, hit request payment, okay, send those off. And if you ever need to do like a reminder of one you've already sent, you could just hit this send a reminder button, say payment request reminder received. I'm just going to go ahead and open up my email.
Charissa Floresca: So my invoice that I've created in the QuickBooks should be sync here in Nickel, right? Everything will sync. The one that is like BillerGenie, the invoicing portal. So we replace the BillerGenie and we go to the Nickel, but then all of the invoices that I made I created in the QuickBooks will also sync here, right?
Colton O'Farrell: Correct? Yes, it will be like what's ever done in Nickel online, whatever's on the will quick sync book online, we'll sync with QuickBooks. in.
Charissa Floresca: All right.
Mike Lovelady: If an ACH or credit card payment fails, are there any notices sent out?
Colton O'Farrell: Of course. Yep, yep. So you would be able to see in your transaction tabs here. So receivables, payables, refunds, returns and chargebacks right there. Were you able to complete the vendor setup? Details, Mike?
Mike Lovelady: Well, I see the delivery by bank and delivery by check.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, if you want to do the delivery by bank, so you can see how quickly we can get the funds into your account, that would be the best option. If you want us to send a check, I mean, we can do that as well. We can send that checks to your vendors if you'd like. There is a $2 fee and it takes a little bit longer, of course, but with the ACH, it's generally same day, two-day turnaround time. and what? Well, he's doing that, Charissa. I was wondering, so I was looking up, you know, some information about the, the company. I was just curious, what are you guys doing in terms of annual company revenue with Mira Staffing right now?
Charissa Floresca: It would be Mike. Can you repeat it? Sorry.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, I was just curious. So I know there's a, you know, Mike, you obviously have multiple businesses under you. It looks like we're primarily looking at Mira Staffing, but I know with Redfish Inspections, Magnolia Home Inspection Services, and OBF Dreams, potentially obviously could set up Nickel accounts with those as well. But I was curious when it comes to like a Mira Staffing perspective, what are you guys doing in terms of annual revenue? And just to confirm, that does not change pricing on our end, just more.
Mike Lovelady: So curiosity, M-I-M. We're doing around 2 million. Two million? What was that looking for? Oh. So checking account routing number.
Colton O'Farrell: Ooh, and I just wanted to mention, oh, sorry, go ahead. Did you have a question, Mike?
Mike Lovelady: No.
Colton O'Farrell: I was just gonna call out, so something else that may be beneficial for you guys. So, Like I mentioned earlier, with how Nickel is set up, so by default, 100% of the credit card surcharge on the accounts receivable side, if your customers want to pay you via credit card, 100% of that will be paid for by the customer. But in settings right here, this is where you can set up a global rule. So right now, by default, it's 100%. But if you wanted some agreement with your customers and set it as a global rule, you're able to change this to any percentage you want. So you can split it 50/50. 25-75, you can fully eat the cost if you wanted to. But again, by default, 100% of that cost will be paid for by the customer. And then on the invoice side, though, however, if you have a particular invoice, like let's say this one here, for example, you can actually override the global settings. So the global settings are 100% of that fee to be paid for by the customer. But say for this one invoice, we want to override that rule. We can go ahead and just change it like so. And if we wanted to disable credit card payments altogether on this invoice, we also could turn that on as well. But just showing some more of the control and flexibility you have around the credit card surcharge options.
Mike Lovelady: Cool.
Colton O'Farrell: All right, well Mike, I'm going to send you that.
Mike Lovelady: Hey, so I just closed that. I mean, I just completed that. Cool.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, I think it's good on our side. Let me just go ahead and enter this information in. I'm gonna make a payment. Yep, cool, looks all good on my end. So if I wanted to pay you via credit card, I could do that right there. If I wanna pay you with my bank via ACH, no fee, I'm gonna go ahead and do that instead, 'cause I don't wanna pay that 2.9% fee there. So we're withdrawing that today. It's gonna take one business day to get into your account and you should receive that $50 by tomorrow. So I'm going to go ahead and hit review and pay. And I got admin and this will go to the admin@mira staffing.com email address. So I'll just say, hi, Mike. Again, for your time today. Awesome. So I'm gonna go ahead and hit Pay Quick. I'm gonna get a receipt for that as well that I'll share with you via email. Oops. And if you wanted to just see what that would look like, here's the PDF version of that $50 we just sent.
Mike Lovelady: Okay, cool. A couple questions.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, yeah.
Mike Lovelady: Back on the payment failures, if the ACH credit card failures, is there an email notice that goes out or do we have to log in and Check it.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep. There would be an email notification letting you know that the payment failed or if there's any kind of any kind of issues when it came to that payment.
Mike Lovelady: Okay. Do you have a credit card expiration report?
Colton O'Farrell: Do we have a credit card expiration report?
Mike Lovelady: Yep.
Colton O'Farrell: Ooh, that is a great question. And I do have an answer to that somewhere. Let me just find I do know. I talked to with one of our engineers about this the other day, so I'm just trying to find the message that he sent for that.
Mike Lovelady: Either that or if we can download.
Colton O'Farrell: I believe there's a notice that's sent if you have a customer credit card that's about to expire on file. There's some kind of notice that will be sent. I'm just trying to find the specific message that he- Notice it to us.
Mike Lovelady: Okay.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep. Letting you know that you'll have to update the customer's payment information.
Mike Lovelady: All right. So let me look at the price.
Colton O'Farrell: So we, so I got the answer. So yes, we When it comes to payment method expiration, so for us, it's tied to expiration, so we will send alerts when a card is about to expire.
Mike Lovelady: Okay. All right. So I'm looking at your payment plans now, the core is three active users.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, let me go ahead and just kind of break that down also. Go ahead and share my screen so Charissa can see what we're talking about.
Mike Lovelady: Yeah, the core won't work because we're doing over $25,000. Right. So we can go to the Nickel Plus.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, so I'm happy to talk through that. So really with Nickel Plus, you get everything that you get on Nickel Core, but you get additional features and removed kind of hurdles. So for example, on the core, we only allow for three active users and we only allow for $25,000 per ACH transaction, not cumulative. So you can do 100 of those. Just cannot do one at $26,000. But if you're doing a lot that are over that 25,000, you of course would want to be on the Nickel Plus. We remove, so you can have unlimited users. There's no hard transaction limit, so we allow for payments up to $1,000,000 per ACH. You can schedule payments in advance, you can do recurring payments, you can do payment authorization forms to send out and just auto pull from your customer's account. You will see typically same day to two day turnaround time when it comes to ACH processing. we are required to still get those payments sent before 4 p.m. Eastern Standard Time. That's the cutoff time with our sponsor bank. But as long as you get it in by that time, you should see a same day to two day turnaround time on ACH payments. The plan is either $45 monthly or it's $35 a month charged annually for $420. There are no other fees associated with Nickel, so we're not there's no transaction fees or hidden fees. the only way that you would pay anything greater than this, either $35 a month or $45 a month, is if you are paying bills on the accounts payable side with Nickel and you're using a company credit card or when your customers are paying you on accounts receivable and they're paying a credit card and you have agreed to eat some of that 2.99% fee. But again, by default, 100% of that cost is to be paid for by the customer. So you would have to change it in order to incur anything there. But questions with pricing, does that make sense? Can I help?
Mike Lovelady: Yeah, yeah. And so the Nickel Plus, I think makes sense for us, because I doubt if we'll use this to pay bills. It'll just be to receive payments.
Colton O'Farrell: Accounts receivable side more so?
Mike Lovelady: Yes, yes.
Colton O'Farrell: What are you doing for paying bills today?
Mike Lovelady: We're just do it through online banking.
Colton O'Farrell: Okay, gotcha. But probably not a huge expense for you guys to deal with.
Mike Lovelady: It's not. It's not. Okay, so I like what I see. Do you have any questions, Teresa?
Charissa Floresca: Right now, all good Mike.
Colton O'Farrell: Okay.
Charissa Floresca: Maybe in the process, yes.
Mike Lovelady: I think we should sign up for the Nickel Plus. You need to schedule a time when we can transition to Nickel Plus. Right. First of the month and Charissa is busy with payroll plus financial statement. She's also our bookkeeper. So she's really busy for the next 10 business days. So it may be.
Colton O'Farrell: Well, I would recommend next week, I.
Charissa Floresca: Think Mike next week, because right now is a busy week for me, Colton. So we can schedule time next week and then. And for the demo, how about. the last question I have, Mike, is sample we have the invoice in the old system. Does this adapt in nickel? Sample we had e. No, you'd have.
Mike Lovelady: To go to QuickBooks. And that's one of things we need to check with Benchmark is if we can continue to log on to their system to look at previous invoices. See that or we're going to have to download those from Benchmark or from BillerGenie. from Builder Genie so that we have a record of them. Yeah. So there's the things we need to do on, on the Builder Genie side to get that taken care of. And then, then we'll have to set a time where we remove Builder Genie, we remove Benchmark, and then add Nickel.
Colton O'Farrell: I would recommend it would be helpful if you signed up earlier than you, then you need Nickel. So if you create your account, you link your payment method, you know, of course we're a financial institution.
Mike Lovelady: We have- you- can do that today.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, that'd be great. Just so we can get that, because sometimes there is a bit of a delay with the first payment just in order to make sure that, you know, you are who you say you are, you're gonna use us, Nickel, how we're intended to. And it's because of course we have, there's like anti-money laundering laws and know your customer laws and regulations Yeah, that we get have it to set follow. up So now, my advice link that payment would be, method, and then when it comes time, pass, you know, after you're less busy next month, you can go ahead and just start sending or receiving payments via Nickel, and you're good to go.
Mike Lovelady: Okay, great. So all you do is click on get started and pick it from there.
Colton O'Farrell: Exactly, yep. So you just create your account, link a payment method, and then you're good to go. Mike, I did want to ask, so are you the business owner when it comes to some of these other divisions that were mentioned I'm one in of your the email?
Mike Lovelady: Business owners. So for Redfish Inspections, we use a sketching software called Spectora.
Colton O'Farrell: Spectora?
Mike Lovelady: Spectora does the invoicing and receiving of payments. And they have their own partners they work with. We don't have any control over that. And so they're going through Stripe right now.
Colton O'Farrell: Is that working well for them?
Mike Lovelady: I think it is. Yeah.
Colton O'Farrell: Because I'd be happy to set up a call with them and talk to them about the process a little bit. I didn't show you this because it wasn't super relevant to your business, but something that we've been doing especially that might be helpful for guys in the field or that are going on job sites is all of our customers with Nickel. So in addition to the invoices being sent and received via that secure payment link, we also set up every company with their own payment portal. So that's found right here. Simply click on that. A lot of our customers will embed this into their website. This kind of serves as a one stop shop just for any customer to make a payment or is like a backup option if they need. But they could pay by card, pay by ACH right there. And then something else that we've done for a lot of our customers is we've actually just built out it built out this into like a QR code. So if you were to scan this with your phone, it would pull up this exact portal that I just showed you a moment ago. that QR code may be helpful for guys, but this allows sometimes guys just to, you know, your installers to quickly scan something. Customer has a secure way to make a payment and they can pay via ACH for free or they can pay via the credit card with that fee.
Mike Lovelady: Yeah, yeah. So you would need to contact Vector directly.
Colton O'Farrell: What's his name?
Mike Lovelady: They have recently sold that company, so I don't know who the new owners are. I personally knew the previous owners. Right.
Colton O'Farrell: And which company was that out of the list?
Mike Lovelady: Spectora.
Colton O'Farrell: Spectora.
Mike Lovelady: Oh, for Redfish.
Colton O'Farrell: For Redfish. And then who at Redfish would be the best person to speak with?
Mike Lovelady: Jessica Ramirez.
Colton O'Farrell: Jessica Ramirez. Awesome. Yeah, because Mike, if we're able to do that as well, I wanted to call out this portion right here. So we'll give you $250 for any kind of referral if they sign up through you. if you get two of those, that pays for nickel plus for an entire year plus gives you like an additional $80 there. So yeah, but we're about to get through Spectator because they have.
Mike Lovelady: Mike, we're about to get 3,000 different clients.
Colton O'Farrell: The Zoom is about to end, so if it does end abruptly, it wasn't me choosing, we just ran out of time. But I'm going to be sending a follow-up email with some resources. If you have any questions, feel free to reply back to that email. Otherwise, really looking forward to getting you set up and supporting your business. I think Nickel's Thank a you.
Mike Lovelady: Great fit Awesome.
Colton O'Farrell: For you. Well, thanks so much everyone. I look forward to working with you and you can expect that email from me shortly. Okay.
Charissa Floresca: Okay. Thank you, Colton. Bye. Bye, Mom. Bye.
