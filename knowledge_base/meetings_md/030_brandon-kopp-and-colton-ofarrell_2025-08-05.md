Brandon: Colton, how you doing?
Colton O'Farrell: Doing super well here. How about yourself, sir?
Brandon: Excellent, man.
Colton O'Farrell: Awesome. Well, Brandon, really glad you could make some time to jump on this call with me today. I was just looking through your website a little bit, just trying to understand more of what you guys got going on. I know that you're looking to look at us for kind of a accounts receivable, so we'd love to hear about what's going on. Sure. But also just curious, what brought you to Nickel, how you found us and what got you to hop on board?
Brandon: So if you're on my website, I'm basically calling out like the packaging part, the other two are just brands, consumer face. So it really, there's just nothing to work with. However, with the packaging side, I work directly with businesses and I use QuickBooks to send them like credit card links and then ACH. But QuickBooks takes 1% off every ACH. They don't have an option to charge your customer the 3%. So then It's you gotta a whole attack an thing. So that's those two pieces alone, if I'm not mistaken, you guys had free ACHs and then you guys are able to tack on to the customer rather than having to reinvoice. So I'm invoicing for that. What's the credit card fee? And it's just, and then you're telling people, oh, we can't take credit cards without the fee.
Colton O'Farrell: Then you're the bad guy.
Brandon: If I get in the card lane, I can, nicely put, I can make you guys the bad guy, I suppose, where you guys just charge a 100%.
Colton O'Farrell: 3% fee Yeah, without we me can having absolutely to discuss it with them every time. solve for all those areas. So were you just doing some kind of organic Google searches?
Brandon: Did you, was it a recommendation? I got you guys in chat GPT actually. Are there any payment, like or payment, like ACH link providers that don't charge the 1%? Because that's the other thing, right? Is I'm so sick of paper checks getting, oh, I mailed the check. I mailed the check. I'm with $15,000. And I'm like, well, did you guys mail the check?
Colton O'Farrell: Cause it's not my mailbox. Yeah. What's still receiving the, what's checks. the time frame Most you're of our generally customers seeing? say it'll I mean, be like are 10 you, to so 14 it sounds days, like some you're even later than that. But you're having a lot of issues then with check.
Brandon: Absolutely. Where it's like, oh, do you send it? Yeah, it's sent. And you're just like, well, and then you're waiting. So that's also a big thing where, well, no, don't worry. You don't gotta send me a check. Just put your bank information the same as on the check. And we can just ACH It's and the we most can cut classic the check trick in the part book out. is the It checks kind of in the puts mail, people right? on the You spot buy too, them without, you every know, one time. I know, I know the game and it takes them away.
Colton O'Farrell: Even if, you know, maybe they put the check in the mail, there's been a huge upsurge in a lot of issues when it comes to check and mail fraud or checks getting intercepted. It's been insane. Most of the customers I talk to, they have some experience it, whether directly or with their customers having issues there. So that's also something that a lot of people look to us to help with because of our built-in fraud protection, bank level security. But based off what you've said thus far, we absolutely could help. I know you're using, so you mentioned QuickBooks Online today. You're sending the invoice to your customer if they're paying via ACH, they're taking that 1% fee from you.
Brandon: Credit cards, so are you accepting credit cards today? So, well, I don't turn it on as an option unless they say they want it because then I have to invoice them for that credit card fee. I'm not paying it's the 3%, just gonna. right? If your That's guys's not, they option.
Colton O'Farrell: Want to to use just a put.
Brandon: Credit it right on there, card. right in So, the link, takes that whole processes away from me. So it simplifies my process at the same time. And like I said, like, I don't like to send them the QuickBooks ACH either, unless they request it, because they're taking one percent and talking 10, 000 bucks, you know, it's 100 bucks.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep. That really adds up. It does.
Brandon: And you get three or four of them a month, all of a sudden it's four or five hundred bucks It should be in my that. pocket.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep, absolutely. No, I mean what you're describing is literally the reason Nickel was founded. We've been around since 2022. We have over 10,000 customers who use us for accounts receivable, accounts payable, or both. I understand you're just looking to do the accounts receivable side. What do you got in place for Bill Pay today?
Brandon: I use bill.com for my ACH platform.
Colton O'Farrell: What do they... Yeah, we have a lot. We run into bill.com, Melio, You know, all those organizations all the time. What do you got set up from the bill pay perspective with bill.com? Are you just paying via ACH? Are you paying via any credit cards?
Brandon: Yeah, I use it only as my ACH platform.
Colton O'Farrell: Got it. And are they charging you anything for that?
Brandon: I think it's 49 cents per ACH and then it's the $30 a month, $30, $40, $50. I don't hate to say it, I don't know how much it is per month, but there's a membership fee. On top of it, I think it's 50 cents per ACH, which they might have just increased that too.
Colton O'Farrell: Well, the other side of it is if you want to use this for accounts payable as well, again, there's no ACH fee on that side as well. There's no ACH for you or for your customers. In terms of what you guys are doing for revenue, so I noticed you have, it looks like three offices, you got a warehouse in Chicago, that's actually where I'm located. What are you guys doing? Where? That's where I grew up. Oh, really? I'm in uptown. I just moved here about 10 months ago from Minneapolis.
Brandon: Yeah, I did it Okay. for, I've Loving been down it. in Florida Four minute walk for from three the years beach.
Colton O'Farrell: Now. I So was it's up there my been whole pretty sick. life. I just, I couldn't do Chicago anymore. Winters, yeah, I came from Minnesota, so honestly the winters are a little easier.
Brandon: But the wind is no joke. So, yeah, I was living up in Old Town before I, oh, Old Town, yeah. So then I grew up in the South, grew up in the South suburbs.
Colton O'Farrell: Did a few years after college in Old Town and I was like, I gotta get the hell out of here. Yeah, the weather For sure, is pretty.
Brandon: Crazy, yeah, our revenue numbers, but other than yeah, that, we it's have an office been in a China, really awesome one down here in our place warehouse. to live. So I love This living year we're here. going to do between five and seven million. Nice. Awesome.
Colton O'Farrell: Well, I'd be happy to show you the bill pay section of this too. So usually what I do, and usually what I do is, you know, I'll just go ahead and share my screen quick. Makes sense kind of just to walk through things. If you have any questions, feel free to stop me. Sure. Just going to go ahead and share my screen though. So first we're going to walk through the accounts What I'm receivable going to. Do side of things. And maybe before I do the accounts receivable side. So what I'm going to do here is set you up as a customer on my demo account so you can see what your customers will receive kind of just perspective from there. But I think there's a lot of value based on what you said from the accounts payable side. So I'd be happy to show you that as well. What I'm going to do is I'm going to send you an email from the accounts. So when you get connected with QuickBooks Online, we have a native integration. You just go to account settings here, integrations, you click the green link QuickBooks account button, you sign in, select your company chart of accounts, everything then flows into Nickel from an accounts receivable perspective.
Brandon: Here, and then an accounts payable perspective here. That was my question. That's why I didn't hook up QuickBooks this morning is on the QuickBooks when I sent a payment link, for some reason it double registers and we have to delete one of them every time. And through So QuickBooks, I didn't hook it up because for it some flows reason, double through my if it register. flows through my So bank that's statement, why I didn't hook up QuickBooks to this morning. So I was like, yeah, it's going.
Colton O'Farrell: To double register if I hook up QuickBooks too, because then I bank account with the deposit. Yeah, yeah, no worries. That is something that can come up. It really depends on how you have your QuickBooks integration set up. But really in this scenario, what we would have is, you know, most of our customers, I'd say 98% of our customers have QuickBooks online. So they're connected a QuickBooks with Nickel. Online There's account. kind of But two if approaches you were, that they this can is do. what you They would can see. one, So turn it on lists some automation. your name, So your since QuickBooks this is a demo account, I'm number, not your actually account connected would be right here. to But we have this toggleable field on here, which is automation, where anytime an invoice is created in QuickBooks, it would just automatically be sent via Nickel. Where it's not good to have this turned on is if you're generating an invoice, people have to go through, make revisions, edit modifications, because each time they would do that so many times. Yep. Your customer would get that automation or would get that email based just recommend on the automation.
Brandon: Leaving that Okay.
Colton O'Farrell: Off. What you would If do that's from the accounts the case receivable for you, we side would is you just come in here, you just come to the get paid side, your invoices would all flow into Nickel here, there'd be a little QuickBooks logo letting you know that's where they came from. You just simply come to this right-hand side which says payment request, you click request payment, you'd send this to your customer either via email or SMS, and I'm actually going to generate an invoice and send it to you just to show you what that looks like. So first, I'm just going to add you as a customer here. Awesome. And what are your typical invoice ranges?
Brandon: Lowest 1500. Yeah, I saw you guys have a $25,000 cap. Those people, you know, we have invoiced up to 100, but those people are using their internal ACH just to send us those anyway. So that's why I kind of liked your 25 cap, because if I'm sending them the link to actually pay like via credit card or via an ACH link, typically it's because they're not big enough to have their own ACH platform within their company.
Colton O'Farrell: Right.
Brandon: So over that, typically those companies just have an ACH platform they're sending directly.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep. No, that makes perfect sense. And with that 25 just to state, it's not like a cumulative amount, it's just 25k per ACH transaction. Okay. So you can do a hundred of those. You just cannot do one at $26,000 in the free plan.
Brandon: Okay. And then also for the, so the payables though, because I ACH a lot of my factories, this that those can go, I do ACH up to like 130 to 150 at a time.
Colton O'Farrell: It's always, yeah, we would, we would most likely, so just understanding your business model, I'm happy to get to the pricing point towards the end just to know it's Very straightforward. We have like a subscription cost. It's either $45 monthly or it's $35 a month on an annual subscription. So $400, $420 annually. There are no other fees or transaction charges. If your customers are paying you via credit cards, they will 100% pay that fee by default. You do have the complete control to go over, to go in there and adjust it at any rate that you'd like, or if you wanted to override like an individual invoice. You could do that. Most customers do not, but we do give you the ability to do that essentially. So what I'm doing here is I'm just generating an invoice directly from Nickel. You don't have to create invoices in here. If you want to just continue in QuickBooks, we'll bring everything in. What's done in Nickel will automatically update QuickBooks and vice versa. I'm just attaching like a sample PDF here. I'm going to send you a quick memo. I can type today. And then I'll just put this in parentheses so you don't forget this is not a real invoice to have to pay. Awesome. So I'm going to go ahead and create that. We're generating a secured payment link that we're going to send you via email. You'll get that in just a moment. But if you were curious what it looked like prior to actually sending to your customer, you could always copy and paste that into a new browser. So this is what you'll see in just a moment.
Brandon: I did make a test order in mine. Oh, nice. I actually did exactly what you. Perfect. Nice.
Colton O'Farrell: There it is. Perfect. Yeah. So when your customer, the nice thing about that is an email, if they hit the reply button, you'll automatically be CC'd on any communication if there's questions. But once they hit that pay now button, they'll just be brought to this screen where they could pay via their bank with ACH for completely for free. They just need to enter their routing and account hit number. pay and it'd be done. Or if they want to pay with a credit card, maybe for a 45-day float, credit card points, whatever the reasoning is, there is a 2.99% fee there. You will only get the net amount. We handle all the PCI compliance, and of course, Nickel's getting the 4485 there. But really straightforward process. Something else that you might find interesting, I didn't see this on your website. So in addition to these individualized secured payment links that we're sending out per invoice, We also set up every company with their own kind of merchant payment link. So that can be found right here. What this is, is essentially a backup method or a one-stop shop for a customer to make a payment. There's no kind of reason for why they're not making a payment. A lot of our customers will embed this directly in their website. It is completely customizable in the settings. So you just come in here, branding, you can update the banner there. And that would reflect right into the portal here. And with this portal, we could also give you a custom URL or domain too, if you'd like. That is part of the subscription plan. The merchant link is available for all customers, even if they're on the Nickel core or free plan. Just if you want to make any kind of modifications to this link here, that's part of the plus subscription. But a lot of our customers will just embed that in their website. Some use it pretty often. Some just keep it as a backup method if that primary method it's not working. It sounds like you know pretty well on the accounts receivable side. You've tested some things out. What questions do you have for me on that portion?
Brandon: Yeah, so I see, like, let's say I do a lot of net 30. So actually, from what it looks like, let's say today's the fifth. Let's say something's due September 1st, just to make it easy. I can put it due September 1st in here, right? And then we'll email them to remind them and stuff too.
Colton O'Farrell: So what we would do is you would just Create the invoice either in Nickel or in QuickBooks Online. You can schedule payments in advance. You can do recurring payments if needed. You would schedule the payment. You could send it out and then if it's due on the first, you just could hit this little reminder button right here to send a reminder.
Brandon: This would just send a quick email. So I'll send a reminder there so.
Colton O'Farrell: You can see what that would send it right to the person. Yep, exactly. So you'll so that should see be that popping in just a up moment. on your side Just in just a got moment. the payment And while reminder. We'Re, while you're kind of seeing that. I'm going to show you the bill pay side, and we'll go ahead and just send you 50 bucks to show you how easy it is to send or receive payments via nickel. So what I'm going to do first is add you as a vendor. So to do that, I'm going to go to new vendor here. I don't have your information, but if you did have your vendors information, you could enter it yourself. But because I don't, So I'm we're going to going just to throw send in you your a vendor quick form to name, fill your out. email. It's going to ask you some questions to fill out here, but once you're done, I'm going to go ahead and just send you 50 bucks via Nickel so you can see how easy it is to send a receive payments. So get that email in just a moment. And if you want to let me.
Brandon: Know when you finish filling out the information, I'd be happy to send that. For sure. Okay, so perfect. Here we go.
Colton O'Farrell: How much do you say you're supposed to make?
Brandon: I'm in bill.com, I'm just trying to do a comparison. Yeah, ACH let me just cost pull plus up the membership pricing. fee.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep. So I'm So we are paying going to about be, 53 so it's bucks either a $45 month with monthly that's or it's including the $35 a month with an annual plan. So billed at one time $420. There's no hidden fees, no transaction charges. The only way you would pay more is again, if you agree to eat some of the credit card surcharge on the accounts receivable side, which we know you're not going to do, or if you were going to pay bills via Nickel with a credit card, there would be of course the fee there. But if you're doing ACH, This is all you can expect to pay.
Brandon: Okay. And then this might be stupid, obviously, once you upload a vendor, it's saved.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep, of course.
Brandon: Okay.
Colton O'Farrell: And if you just have the list. When you do the integration with QuickBooks, we'll bring over all your vendors, all of your customers. If you have those living on like a different area or like a CSV.
Brandon: You could always send that to our team and they'd be happy to upload it for you.
Colton O'Farrell: You guys do that from bill.com rather than QuickBooks? Yeah, so if you want to download like Because a CSV I use, I from just use, bill.com yeah, if you, of all of if your you information, want to get us that a would platform. work perfect for us to get uploaded. You just send that to me or our team and we'd get that added to your account. Kind of the main differences when it comes to the... So I believe just based on the level of business that you're doing, Nickel Plus would be kind of where you'd want to go. What this does is it allows for unlimited active users on the account. There's no hard transaction limit. The kind of soft transaction limit is a million dollars per ACH. you can schedule payments in advance, can do recurring payments in advance. And then for the ACH processing, it's generally same day to two day turnaround time, depending on when you get that into our sponsor bank. So the cutoff times are 4 PM Eastern Standard Time, but as long as you get it in within that time frame, that's what you should expect for the ACH processing.
Brandon: And credit card, obviously probably another stupid question, but I can obviously like the last month pretend it's July 25th. I can schedule things to clear out August 1st and stuff like that, right?
Colton O'Farrell: What do you mean clear out?
Brandon: Let's say I have I owe ABC Inc $1,000 but I don't want it to, I'm gonna get it set up now but I'm not gonna have it leave my bank account till the 1st. I can process that. Oh, of course.
Colton O'Farrell: You can schedule your payments to go out in advance. Yep, of course.
Brandon: Cool.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, of course. Any other questions with kind of the pricing aspect there?
Brandon: No, like it seems pretty up front, which I appreciate.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, we've definitely designed this to be very straightforward, transparent. People hate hidden fees. they hate getting nickel and dime for everything. And so we want to stay far away from that.
Brandon: That's what owning a business is, is I swear I'm like a human ATM machine.
Colton O'Farrell: No, for real. It's insane. So we've seen what the other big players have done and we want to stay away from that.
Brandon: So do you guys just make money on memberships and credit card processing?
Colton O'Farrell: So that's a great question. So we make, to answer your question, yes, we do make money from the subscription and then the credit card processing. Even if we have customers who are on our free Nickel Corp plan, and say they're doing 100% ACH, they're not paying us anything, of course, but we're making them very happy by providing a great service. And in addition to that, even if they're not paying us, well, these people are leaving reviews, referrals. If you go online to G2, we have a five-star rating there. We're ranked the number one easiest payment solution to use. But even if they're not paying us anything, Our internal data shows about one out of every five invoices is paid for via a credit card. So when they send that invoice to their customer, one out of five of those is going to pay for it with a credit card. So of course we're making money off of that. But we are a cash positive business. Like I mentioned, we have over 10,000 customers using us today. So things are going really well. And then of course, obviously with the Nickel Plus, we make the subscription costs there.
Brandon: Gotcha. I mean, that's great. I'm sold.
Colton O'Farrell: Awesome. Did you get a chance to fill in the. Let me pull. I did get the email.
Brandon: Sorry. No, no, you're totally good.
Colton O'Farrell: I just want to make sure I also get you.
Brandon: I'll have to just show you and.
Colton O'Farrell: Thank you for your time. Totally cool.
Brandon: No, this is awesome. I don't know why you guys. I can't believe I just found you guys today. Honestly, I just got. I was just so sick of it today. This morning, for some reason, I'm just like, ask ChatGPT. I'm like, there has to be something. There's free ACHs and You stuff guys like that. solved And. another problem without me actually looking to solve it.
Colton O'Farrell: That's awesome to hear. And that's the other kind of byproduct thing is we hear more and more people are finding us through ChatGPT. But if you make people really happy and they're posting about online, whether it's Reddit, whether it's G2, whatever, ChatGPT is grabbing all that. And I mean, it's not hard to be like Melio or Bill.com the other thing I wanted to call out to you that might be interesting as well. There's this box here. So you will have your own referral if link any right customer here. signs up or any company signs up via your referral link, we'll give you the $250 each once they're activated. So there's some criteria there. But if you get two referrals to us, that essentially pays for Nickel Plus for an entire year. Plus gives you 80 bucks in addition into your pocket.
Brandon: So I have to have to think about who I can recommend.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, absolutely.
Brandon: So, like I said, the ease of use was great. Again, I don't know, I'm probably a little younger than most people you talk to who probably struggle I won't buy it.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, no, I talked to the whole wide range of people. So it got really tech savvy and then people who, yeah, I've been faxing everything still for the last few decades.
Brandon: So.
Colton O'Farrell: Cool.
Brandon: I think I'm submitting. Cool.
Colton O'Farrell: All right. So I'm gonna go to new bill just to show you this here. So I'm gonna grab you. Oops.
Brandon: I still, this thing is still spinning. I hit submit though. Oh, there we go.
Colton O'Farrell: Perfect. And then did you list, put the bank information or did you select check? I'm sorry, I didn't act.
Brandon: I put my bank info in.
Colton O'Farrell: Perfect. I was just gonna say sometimes I've had people when I'm doing this that they'll select the check option. I'm like, that's fine. We'll send you a check. You just won't get to see like.
Brandon: The speed of it.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah.
Brandon: I don't hear the word chug anymore today, Colton.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, I know, sorry.
Brandon: Awesome.
Colton O'Farrell: So I'll just put this as right there. And I'll go to make a payment. Let me go ahead. So if we were to do the credit card then there's the same day right there. I'm gonna go ahead and just select our bank account right there. It's gonna give you the time frame of when this is gonna be withdrawn, sold. If you need to adjust that at any point, you can do that right there. It's showing where it's gonna be sent to if I wanted to override that though, and not gonna say the word, but I'm gonna hit review and pay, but oops. Awesome. So I'm going to just hit pay quick. I got the receipt right there. So also send that to you in my follow-up email once we're done here. But you can kind of see what it would, an example of what that would look like.
Brandon: Awesome, man. Yeah, I'm going to sign up. This is cool. I like you guys. I like the straightforward thing. I don't have any ties to build.com besides I use some ACH, so yeah. the only the other thing I guess the only other question I have is I get like there's some customers that use bill.com where I send the invoice through there I don't know if you didn't even know this if you're if you can even tell me this like I actually did it this morning I know it's very few and far between but they're like oh we use bill.com so if I stop my membership they can still pay me through bill.com right.
Colton O'Farrell: If that's what they use yeah so if if like you're saying your customers or your vendors are using bill.com and they're sending it to you yes of course okay, so that would still be able to. Yep.
Brandon: All right, man, you got me sold. I'm gonna cancel bill.com, and I'm gonna sign up.
Colton O'Farrell: We love to hear that. And I'll send you some resources just to talk a little bit, too. I didn't really kind of COVID this aspect, but I'll link some resources for you. We do have our network and data protection, like kind of security information, so just a couple high level things to cover with you. So all of your money is being moved through FDIC insured accounts, so it's always your money. We're simply the processor taking it from your customer's account, putting in yours. You can do like multiple invoices or bills at one time, but we're never like waiting in a batch to process those. We're processing them all as their own individual atomic unit. That way we ensure there's one to one reconciliation between you, your customer and your banks. We handle, like I said, all the PCI compliance. We're SOC 2 compliant. So we will protect all of your information, all of your customers information. We use encryption and tokenization to with those secure payment links. So those are always protected. And then I talked a little bit about the fraud protection and built-in bank level security. But kind of just the main way to explain that is we are basically on the front lines for our customers when it comes to any kind of bad actors or fraud. So we have our own kind of main account where money is being put into being pulled from that to pay for our customers. And that's one way that we can kind of accelerate that timeline. But If somebody was to try to attack you like via Nickel, they would have to go through our team and our banks. They're put on the front end and all of yours are kind of shielded from that way. So be sure to provide that information. But I know some teams have some questions with that. So just wanted to kind of clarify how we operate in that way.
Brandon: And then it doesn't happen like once in last year. If I send a payment, someone's account that bounces back, how does that look with you guys?
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, so this will change in the future, but right now there is no fees associated with that. If it became like a reoccurring problem where it was just continuously like then we do reserve the right to review the account, potentially suspend service. But I have not really run into many of those issues.
Brandon: Happened once in the last year.
Colton O'Farrell: Right, exactly.
Brandon: It's pretty, it's pretty like a bank error where Chase was like, oh yeah, we were supposed to accept that and sent it back. So, But I'm just wondering, I just asked, yeah, no, it's a great question.
Colton O'Farrell: Right now, right now there would be no like fees associated with that. I know that will change in the.
Brandon: Future where that happens.
Colton O'Farrell: But for as of right now, there's no fees associated. Awesome.
Brandon: Sounds great, Colton.
Colton O'Farrell: All you got to do, so you got your account set up, you, all you have to do is link a payment method, which I believe you've done. Once you've done that though, you're ready to start sending or receiving payments via Nickel. Know I will your say customer that, you regulations, know, we do anti-money have to follow federal laundering regulations. regulations. So So there's sometimes some there like, is a bit of a, like, just with that, those, like the first payment, it might be a slight delay as we're making sure we're checking those boxes.
Brandon: But after that, yeah, man.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep. You should have, you know, like the time frames that I shared should be what to expect in the future.
Brandon: Don't worry, man. I'm only, I only sell bags. Nothing crazy here. Bags and boxes.
