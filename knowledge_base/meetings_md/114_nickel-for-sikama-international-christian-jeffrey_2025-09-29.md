Christian Sheerer: How's it going?
Jeffrey Blair: Good, thanks.
Christian Sheerer: Glad we made the time. Sorry about not sending it over on Friday. Total brain fart on my end. Yes, I know we reached out to you, but I guess I typically like to start these in 30 minutes still. Okay with you?
Jeffrey Blair: Yeah, as quick as possible to be honest. But 30 is fine if it comes to that.
Christian Sheerer: Oh, should be, should be, should be super quick. I mean the platform is like foolproof enough that we can click through it rather briefly. It would really just be about sort of game planning, you know, from the stage that you guys are at in terms of like how you take payments, how you send them out, how we might fit into the workflow of what surrounds it and make a comparison between the ways that you currently do do things. And so I just would want to start with just like a refresher from your on that. I know that there are some large transactions which is sort of what we're built to do. So I'm glad you know our outreach landed in your inbox and so I can explain at a high level and then after that like the, based on what you're telling me at a high level, how we fit into it and then the platform actual exploration should be pretty quick. And then we can set up a game plan for if you'd want to get activated and moving some transactions through.
Jeffrey Blair: Okay, great. Sound good? Cool.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. So you tell me, I mean, I know is there three different ways that you guys accept payments? Is it all in one platform? How do you guys set it up when you're setting up?
Jeffrey Blair: Yeah, right. I would say the majority of our transactions are done through wire transfer to our bank or, or credit card frankly for some of the smaller things. But those can be up into the 30, $40,000 range as well. Usually anything bigger than that is wire transfer we do have. I would say it's a 50, 50 split between US and international payments. So of course that adds some of its own challenges, but in general that's the methodology reviews. Now I'd say we're frankly not trying to solve any specific problems, but I think like you've mentioned streamlining structure that's customer facing and makes it easier. I think that's worth exploring potentially especially maybe for some of the international customers that we have. I'm not sure if that's some an area you play and you guys are strong, but somewhere that I could like to explore a little deeper if possible because that can come with its own challenges. But that other than that, I mean, honestly I don't think we, I'M sure we take checks from various customers and so on but that's relatively low volume I think. But I think that's kind of it in a nutshell.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, it's 50, 50 domestic international.
Jeffrey Blair: Okay, that's correct.
Christian Sheerer: Well I'll say one thing and you let me know if we need to just cut everything off right now, totally fine. But our ambition is to get to international. Right. Like we fintech platform, that's like what we want to do. We currently as it stands accept international card payments. So money going out. We're kind of going through the whole. Do you know are you familiar with like what Air Wallix is?
Jeffrey Blair: No, I'm not.
Christian Sheerer: Oh it's an international sort of like banking rails underlying provider for people who do international pay. I worked at a global payroll company before this basically.
Jeffrey Blair: Okay, got it.
Christian Sheerer: And you have to you know connect up with Air Wallix of managing the metaphorical pipes under the Atlantic Ocean. Right. That's moving the US otherwise. And you know they're very strict in anti money laundering. Right. Terrorism, etc.
Jeffrey Blair: Right.
Christian Sheerer: All this stuff. And so we're going through and investing in the kind of like the stuff to get us over the regulatory and compliance hurdles. But as of right now we only accept international card payments through nickel. I don't think that precludes like us kind of streamlining some of the things on the domestic side for now is it? So it's, it's like these wire, these international wires are still a big portion of the 50% on those that's going international.
Jeffrey Blair: Okay, yeah, I would say that's accurate generally and I'd say the majority of the international payments we get, are they on the larger side? Yeah, of that our domestics are a bit smaller. Usually the equipment we sell domestically is a bit, a bit lower price.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, okay, I hear you. And so to dial in on what we can do on the domestic side, can you just walk me through like the actual process of sending. I know how to wire gets sent but, but being like from, from the initial deal stage of your guys is dealing with a customer all the way to the point where they're you know now going to pay you. Is that happening in some platform or you have some project management tool or some CRMs and then you're on a case by case or like on an individual customer basis sending over wire information?
Jeffrey Blair: Yeah, so I would say it varies from our side of it when we make a sale that's all presale quoting et cetera, customer says okay, yeah we want to buy One of these, from there the customers might, well all of them, if they aren't a previous customer, would require us to share the required documentation so we can get set up in their system as a vendor. Yeah, and that's, that's going to be those standard things, tax identification numbers or you know, this and that. So that's going to be given to them. Similarly we, we need from them just their basic addresses, contact information, etc. Etc. And that's, that's the kind of basic case then some of the larger customers overseas we work, we sell into a lot of semiconductor companies that are in Taiwan and Southeast Asia. Many of those have their own system set up, a financial system set up. So we need to basically become a vendor in their system. So they send a link and we upload all the things and, etc, including like liability insurance and all the things they require. So that's another thing that we, we do on a regular basis. I would say we're not getting new customers every week. A lot of times it's, you know, one new customer every month maybe and then there's a lot of repeat business within that. So once that initial upfront work is done, you're good to go. And it's relatively streamlined. The big thing is, well, generally speaking internationally, sometimes we, if we put terms in place with these customers, sometimes that can be challenging to collect your money. Especially ironically, the larger the company, sometimes the harder it is to get paid. But it does happen. It just tends to take some time. But not sure if that plays into anything that you guys would have any control over either. But anyways, that's, that's kind of where it stands. And then once we get a, that channel set up, we invoice them, we just send them an invoice paper email and basically they submit that payment through wire transfer. Usually like I said, we do take a credit card payment. They pick up the phone, they call us, we take that information over the phone. So it's never really transacted, it's never really written down in any digital format where it could be intercepted. So that's pretty much it, I would say. Am I missing anything as far as questions on that process?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, I mean now I'm wrapping my head around, I'm trying to dial in on where I think we can, where I think we can help. And so it's, you're, you're getting set up as a vendor in their platform. You're just sending an invoice. Do you guys have like an ERP that's creating invoices for you?
Jeffrey Blair: We do sort of. We use. We don't. It's, you know, ERP is a strong word for it. We really just use QuickBooks. Yeah, that's our main financial tool that we use. We do have an internal inventory management system, which you would maybe consider an mrp. But overall, there's really no linkage outside of aligning our order IDs between the two platforms. There's no communication beyond that. So. But we use QuickBooks for all of our financial management.
Christian Sheerer: Is that online?
Jeffrey Blair: No, we still use the desktop version of QuickBooks. Okay. And that's because QuickBooks have decided that their online platform doesn't use sales orders the way we use sales orders. And there's no. We're talking many times about this. There's no way for us to actually retain our history on the online platform, our sales history. So we would have to basically just have an archive version that we reference. And that is challenging because we often reference historical data. So right now it's the. It's a QuickBooks desktop premiere, I think we use.
Christian Sheerer: Cool. Desktop Premiere. Awesome. And so that is where an invoice gets created and then you're just downloading it and sending it as a attachment, right? That's exactly in an email to the AP team.
Jeffrey Blair: Yep, that's right. Exactly. I don't think there's anything automated through QuickBooks.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. Cool. Okay. And then so for the batch of transactions, is the 5-40K using your heuristic of breaking them out that do require credit card or they want to pay via credit card. You're. They say, okay, so they get that email AP team, and they're like, we're going to pay by credit. Can you rewrite this invoice? And then you rewrite the invoice, you send it out to them.
Jeffrey Blair: Yeah, Basically that's the case. They know they're going to pay that credit card. So we just update the invoice to reflect that and then they call us and make the payment.
Christian Sheerer: How are you. How are you updating it?
Jeffrey Blair: How are we updating the invoice? Yeah, just updating QuickBooks.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. More so are you. You're adding like a line item for whatever surcharge is happening.
Jeffrey Blair: We absorb the surcharge, so we don't even add in a surcharge for the credit card.
Christian Sheerer: So what's the update necessary then? It's just that, that.
Jeffrey Blair: Oh, it's just they're paying by credit card. Yeah. Because if we might say your terms are net 30. We also, then if we the customer asks they want to pay by credit card. We might leave it at net 30, but then if we, we want to do it where we know we're going to collect payment today, we would just update the invoice to basically say credit card payment and then immediate.
Christian Sheerer: Got you, got you. You know, I think we couldn't actually for a lot of them. And there's a wire. The wire is important because it's just like the instantaneous nature of it. Or is it just because you want to avoid ACH fees from QuickBooks?
Jeffrey Blair: I would say it's the, yeah, it's the instantaneous nature of it. I don't think we've, it's almost like we don't have, we don't get payments enough that are wire transfer that we have felt the need to go to a more automated, like automatically collecting payments through QuickBooks. It's just, just as easy to go and collect them manually essentially. It's not, not to say it's, I wouldn't be helpful, but it's just not been a problem area for us, I think. So we haven't investigated it. Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: Well, the reason is, is because I'm thinking that there. So I'll show you kind of like what we do on an invoice because I think that there's like a lot of time and back and forth communication that could be solved for. It's. Yeah, it's, it's fun for me just, you know, for smaller groups and. How much, how much do you guys do a month?
Jeffrey Blair: I would say a few hundred thousand dollars probably. Okay.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, it's fun for, for some groups to be like, hey, you know, we'll save you a thousand bucks a month on the 1% that you'll pay ACH with QuickBooks. Sure, that's cool. Right? But as somebody, I'm, I'm, I'm interested in selling software because it's like, okay, I can kind of think through a problem that saves people time. And if, if you're, you're doing the math, like 1% on your fees, that's a, you know, that's a big savings. But it's like the time and back and forth and having to like delay a sale because, you know, they say, oh, I want to pay by credit card. And then you have to get on the phone with them when they were ready to buy. Right. It's like the more, the more intriguing and fun part I think about what we do at nickel and what I do in helping people use software. So like it. So. And the Reason I asked about the instantaneous nature of it is because our turnaround time on ACH is two business days and one business day for card. And so I wanted to just honestly raise that and be like, oh, if, if you guys are doing everything on wire and it's like pretty much getting there right away or within that day because I know wires typically a little bit faster than an ACH and if that was going to be an issue, but it sounds like that's probably not really the reason.
Jeffrey Blair: Not really. No, it's not. That's not been a pain point anyways.
Christian Sheerer: Awesome. So yeah, so I think that we're going to be able to handle a lot of this back and forth communication and like when people move over to us they're typically, you know, check heavy or manual payment process heavy or they have three different automated types of payment, like three different payment portals. One for their ACH bits, one for their credit card bits, another for you know, if they're doing wires and then a fourth if they're doing checks, they collapse that into one nickel so that they just have like hey, I sent you a payment link. And that's what, that's what I'll show you. I sent you a payment link. So just pay out against the payment link whatever way that you want to do it and you avoid that back and forth. And that's where they say oh, we save like 12 hours a month on just collecting payments. And so if I go into nickel we can also set up a custom integration for desktop. We have like the API 2015 type integration with online which most fintechs do. But you know, we can go into your desktop account. It'll take some engineering lift on our end but pretty simple. And pull over those invoices and customers right away, is it? So most of them are recurring or. No, it's just.
Jeffrey Blair: Most are occurring. Yeah, I would say. Yeah, like I said, maybe one new customer a month is kind of an average, I would say.
Christian Sheerer: But they're not recurring. Like it's not like a subscription model. They're just buying new stuff.
Jeffrey Blair: That's correct. Yeah, they would just be buying new things. There's no, yeah, there's no subscription model, there's no service. At most we have annual service contracts in places and customers that they make a one time payment every year for.
Christian Sheerer: Something and it's an invoice for equipment. So it's like they're just buying new equipment. It's not like you have them set up like oh, you're going to buy this amount of equipment. And then the next month you're going to buy this amount of equipment or the next quarter or the next year. A new invoice every time.
Jeffrey Blair: Yeah, that's right.
Christian Sheerer: Beautiful. Okay, cool. We can set up the integration. We'll have like an AI agent go in and pull invoices automatically on a regular cadence so that you can just go in and request a payment. I'll show you what that looks like, but I'll edit this and pretend like I'm starting from scratch and just say, Here is the $100,000 invoice. It's for today, and we're going to make the due date today. You could also set up the terms that you have. Another one of the things that we're building out where is kind of like trade credit. So for people that you do have terms with, making cash flow a little bit easier would just delay that and put that into your thinking about the overall horizon of how nickel down the line could kind of capture.
Jeffrey Blair: A little.
Christian Sheerer: Bit more of what you guys do. And so let's say, okay, I put it out into the due date. I'm going to save the changes and I'm going to send them this link. So as overview of the amount, whatever we would pull in that invoice that's created by QuickBooks itself. You could also upload any other documents you want. I'll put in a fake one just to show you what that kind of experience looks like. And I'm going to send the link out to them. You can also. Do you ever charge people if you just have their stuff on file already for like.
Jeffrey Blair: I think we do. Yeah, we. We've done that on a generally seldom basis, but I think it happens.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, cool. Yeah, we can set that up too. But majority of the time, people are sending a link out. And so I'll show you what that looks like on the receiving end. Okay, so now I'm a customer. I'm Christian, getting a bill and invoice from Degrad Distribution or from Sakama. And I'll go in and I can pay this. So I've set it up the way that you guys do, which is where you're eating the AR fee for credit card. I just put in my card details and pay it out. So I mean, it adds up really. It's. It seems like a simple thing where you're not, you're not, you're not, you're not having to call them. And that's. And calling them is, you know, probably simple. Hey, we need your, you know, credit card details or we need you to put your account and routing number like across, you know, the myriad of customers that there are. They can come in and it might be a little bit easier for them too because they, you know, a lower level person in the AP team might have access to this and can, you know, reconcile it pretty quickly.
Jeffrey Blair: Right.
Christian Sheerer: And so this is where I think kind of like the efficiency comes in and we're not going to free and like the reason other software companies aren't able to do what we do is just they didn't invest in like you know, thinking about a payments like an online transaction that is above even $5,000. Really if you tried to do that through stripe like they, you know, freak out for like three days and make you multi factor into your bank and you factor back into them. And so I think this is where we get the efficiency gains for you guys. Specifically where you're not even having to go back and forth. Oh, I'm back, my bad. I wasn't sharing the right tab where they're, where they're back here and they're. And they're putting this stuff in directly related to that one invoice that got sent over.
Jeffrey Blair: Okay, so tell me a little bit about the fees that you guys charge than in comparison.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, so the, because you guys are going to be doing above 25, 000, you're gonna be in the nickel plus territory which whenever I tell pricing about it I kind of laugh because it's like I think really good value and as you know, salesperson I, I think it's really good value. I guess I'll say that again. It's 35amonth for to use a platform per company and then ACH is free sort of our version of the Costco hot dog.
Jeffrey Blair: Right.
Christian Sheerer: I think as we like develop product depth beyond where we're at now, like net terms will be a thing that we want to, you know, negotiate on stuff like that. And then credit card is if you're eating the fees on a credit card for an AR transaction for your customers it's 2.9%. If you were pushing it on to them, they'd be paying the 2.99%.
Jeffrey Blair: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: And so that's, that's really it. Yeah, it's 35amonth sort of base for software and then 2.9 on the credit card transactions.
Jeffrey Blair: Okay, got it. All right, that's interesting. Yeah, that's good. Also just out of curiosity, actually thinking about another business I consult for. If it's not the plus and I'm just doing hundreds or thousands of dollars a day and, or maybe not even just a month or something. What is the non plus version?
Christian Sheerer: Non plus is free. There are limitations beyond the 25,000 which are. Can't do recurring payments. You also can only have three users, meaning three Jeffries plus Jim and Joe. Right. Who are able to interact with the platform and have accounts on it and, and whatnot. And you also can't set up like you can't, you can't schedule payments into the future, schedule invoices into the future or schedule vendor payments into the future. But, but yeah it is, it is technically a freemium situation.
Jeffrey Blair: Got it. Okay, understood.
Christian Sheerer: And then the credit card fees still apply there.
Jeffrey Blair: Yeah, right, right, exactly. Okay. And this they'd be the same rates. The 2.9. The 2.99. Got it. Okay.
Christian Sheerer: A little bit longer turnaround times. ACH is three day for the free version and two day on credit card versus two and one on plus.
Jeffrey Blair: Okay, good to know.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. The other thing is like we probably wouldn't set up a you know those integrations that we would deploy our like AI agent into.
Jeffrey Blair: Right.
Christian Sheerer: Unless we could like reasonably see that somebody using the free version is going to have a high level of like credit card spend.
Jeffrey Blair: Right.
Christian Sheerer: Just slight inside baseball on where we want to direct our resources.
Jeffrey Blair: Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah, that makes sense for sure. Okay, good. That's interesting. I assume you can send over some information just as a follow up to this. And, and I would basically review with the other other counterparts company just to see if this makes sense from any perspective. And also like I said, I do have a side thing that I do that I might look at this a little closer to. It's a lower back, lower dollar dollar value. But I think it would be still possibly provide some good simplicity to my daily tasks.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, absolutely. I mean what I guess what are your impressions And I guess I would maybe maybe to give you, give you a test when you're based on what we've spoken about. Now speaking with the counterparts, first of all, who are they? Who are you thinking about? Would have to take a look at it.
Jeffrey Blair: This would be the president of the company and then the general manager. She's basically mirrors as our, our ARAP employee as well.
Christian Sheerer: Nice. And yeah, based on what we've chatted and like the scope of where we can help, how would you I guess explain it to her?
Jeffrey Blair: I think my first question there would be to confirm what pain points she has and I think it's going to be focusing on how much time is she spending like writing emails, doing these things, collecting this information, you know, so on and so forth. And you know how this type of a thing can be a bolt on that simplifies that those tasks for her. The big thing I was wondering, and you've answered it now is the kind of the cost and there's a, there's a savings there it seems as well, I am a little curious what that looks like if you guys are to integrate with our system now and how streamlined that could be and so, you know, so to speak. So that's a little bit of an open, open ended item for me right now. But, but in general those would be the questions I would ask her and the information I would give her.
Christian Sheerer: How many customers you guys have that I can give you a sense of the time investment?
Jeffrey Blair: Yeah, I would say in any given year we probably sell to maybe 150 customers. Let's call it.
Christian Sheerer: Oh yeah, simple.
Jeffrey Blair: Yeah, very easy.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. And it'd be simple for us. And just to give you a scope of it, like if I turned around to our engineering team and I was like, hey, we need to build out this like and we have, we've built it out many times. It's just like an AI agent that we pop into. So it's just like a different version of an integration. It's like not an open API sieve, right. Like a QuickBooks Online where they have API documentation. We just build it out. The desktop is like custom for each individual business. And I turned around to them and I was like, hey, this is a $1 million a year company and they want a desktop integration and they have 20 customers. They'd be like, well they can just upload their customers pretty easily. It would take them like maybe 15 minutes probably. But for you guys, I mean it's something that we would definitely turn around and want to invest our time in doing and sort of that would just require like as part of the follow up I can kind of give you the list of things that we need from you to make that happen. But I would probably set that to after we have a conversation with the ARAP person and see if it's valuable to go through that exercise. Probably, you know, able to take like 20 minutes to extract whether she might find it valuable for those particular ones domestically that we can focus on. And then we can from there be like, okay, talk to me about how your manual process of sending out these wire informations and you guys having to handle the PCI compliance on the card stuff. Et cetera. I think that's another value add too, is like you're kind of offloading the compliance bit to us because we, you know, we're going to be handling the transaction.
Jeffrey Blair: Right. And there's. Yeah, I can see some value in that.
Christian Sheerer: And then, so then we, so we kind of, whatever, what's the word? Deduce, you know, whether it'd be useful for her. And then we can go and set up that exercise of like, okay, here's how we get your stuff from QuickBooks Desktop over to us. And it's not like you have like 10,000 customers. Right. Which is good for us too.
Jeffrey Blair: Yeah. Okay, that makes sense. Cool.
Christian Sheerer: Did you want to kind of put time so that in between now and then you have that conversation with her, see if it'll pique her interest and then I can speak with her directly and we can kind of go through those things together.
Jeffrey Blair: Yeah, let me review it, internalize it. I'm going to be traveling starting tomorrow almost for the next two weeks, so I'll be pretty busy. But I should have some time to review the information you send me and then I can have a chat with them just to kind of gauge interest from them as well. This is exploratory and appreciate you reaching out. Just kind of introduce us to something we may not have been aware of, which I wasn't. So, so that's good. And then, yeah, frankly I'll be completely awesome. They might be like, eh, not worth the effort. There's a possibility. But I, you know, at least I can better understand the challenges that they see more than I, more than I see it because I don't do that on a daily basis. I'm, I'm working on developing the business and you know, the commercial side of things, she's doing the actual transaction so I can have the conversation with her to see if some of these items peak her interest as well.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, yeah. And I mean, I'm sure you can appreciate my saying that like I can take on that role too of helping compare the current state to what it would look like with, with nickel. I mean, obviously I've just been here for a couple months, helped like about 100 companies so far in on the three, three digit range. And you guys are sitting exactly in the, in the way that we wanted to build for. Right. Like small amount of transactions, high volume per. Or sorry, small amount of volume, high amount per transaction.
Jeffrey Blair: Right.
Christian Sheerer: And really kind of getting out of the weeds of those like, you know, back and forth conversations that I think kind of, you know, waste a lot of time. So did you want to put something on. On the calendar for when you're. When you're back?
Jeffrey Blair: Yes, I can do that. I'd say right now, look at my. Yeah, maybe like the 14th or something would be a possibility.
Christian Sheerer: Perfect.
Jeffrey Blair: Now let's go a little bit later in case I don't have a chance to chat. Let's do like 15. Cool.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. What time works?
Jeffrey Blair: You're East Coast.
Christian Sheerer: Did you say I'm in the East Coast?
Jeffrey Blair: Yeah, anytime. Like, late morning would be fine for me.
Christian Sheerer: Cool. You want to do 11:30?
Jeffrey Blair: Yeah, that works. Cool.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, I'll send that over now, if you don't mind. One sec. It's Jeff, right? Just Jeff at Sakama.
Jeffrey Blair: Cool.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. If you don't mind just confirming so I can save it on my calendar. And then I think worst case, too. Or before I get into the worst case, best case, if she wants to hop on. So we can avoid any telephone games. Sure, I can. We can run through the same process, go a little bit deeper just because she's closer to the actual, like, manipulation of sending out that stuff. Right. And that's where. That's where her. Her time is spent and do that comparison. So if you wanted to invite her, that'd be great. And then worst case, she's like, oh, I don't know, maybe it's not detrimental to the business, but maybe we save like 10 hours a month. Only pay 35 bucks to do that. That's cool. I guess that's a good case. And then worst case, sorry. Finally, maybe she learns a little bit or two about how to get more value out of the current things that you guys are doing.
Jeffrey Blair: Sure. I appreciate that. Yeah, for sure. Cool. Just got the invite and accepted. I might. I might be able to delay on my response, so.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, no worries. I got it. Awesome. Yeah. Anything else for me while. While. While we're. Sean.
Jeffrey Blair: No, I appreciate it. Thanks for the introduction today and. Interesting platform, for sure. I think. Yeah. Even if it's not being used for comma. Like I said, there's a chance I'd implement this. Some other consulting things I do that I'll think through that a little bit and let you know.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, I really appreciate your time and it's good to open it up regardless.
Jeffrey Blair: Like.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, I'm on. Under. Under no dream state impression that every time, you know, sometimes it happens, people get started right away. But got to go through the process of making sure everybody who's going to be manipulating it are, are, are. Are all for it.
Jeffrey Blair: Yeah, exactly. I appreciate that.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, no problem. Wonderful to meet you.
Jeffrey Blair: Yeah, you as well. Thanks a lot. And enjoy the rest of your week.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, you too. I'll see you soon. Enjoy your trip.
Jeffrey Blair: Thanks a lot. Appreciate that.
