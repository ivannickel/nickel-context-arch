Jacob Greenberg: It.
margaritairuela: Hello, Jacob.
Jacob Greenberg: Hello.
margaritairuela: Hello, Jacob.
Jacob Greenberg: Hey. How's it going?
margaritairuela: How are you?
Jacob Greenberg: I'm good. I'm gonna video real quick. How's your day going?
margaritairuela: Good, Good. I just. I. I came across your information a couple times online, and I wanted to touch base and see if you guys were a right fit. I did sign up for the free trial or something, but the capabilities that I was looking for weren't in that trial, so that's why I'm reaching out.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, awesome. Yeah. So just before we dive into it, I have 30 minutes on the calendar. Does that still work for you?
margaritairuela: Yeah, that's fine.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, cool. I want to make sure I'm not being disrespectful of your time here. So you said you came across this online and you already set up an account. What exactly are you looking to accomplish? Give me a little bit of background about your business.
margaritairuela: Sure. So what we're looking to do is be able to process payments and process payments and pass the credit card fees on to the customers and offer both ACH and credit card payments in one email to the customer. So not having to ask them before, do you want to do ACH or do you want to do credit card? We just send that invoice, and it integrates with QuickBooks and it sends reminders, and we don't have to worry about asking them. We can pass the fees on to the customer. We'd like to eat the ACH fees. And also the transactions are going to be significant. You know, it could be anywhere between $2,000. It could be $10,000. I understand that that might be something important too. So we currently use QuickBooks, ACH and all that, but we wanted to get something a little more robust to pass the fees on.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, cool. So you guys are looking for an easy process to offer both ACH and credit cards to the customer in a single place in a way that you don't have to pay any of those fees you're currently using. QuickBooks Pay might not be robust enough. Probably incurring some fees. And your typical transaction time is somewhere or transaction volume is between 2,000 and 10,000 per transaction. How frequently are you doing transactions? Is it multiple a day, multiple a week? How many in the typical week do you guys process?
margaritairuela: I would say. Let me see how many we had this week. See?
Jacob Greenberg: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
margaritairuela: About nine or ten a week.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. That was good. You guys are looking at, like, an annual processing for revenue of, like, between 2 and 3 million per year.
margaritairuela: No, that's what the company used to be at. So here's another question. So we just acquired the company via an asset purchase agreement and it was, it was in the, in the, in the millions and we're trying to get it back to. To where it was. So it. I would think it'd be no more than 500,000 this first year, but maybe more, I'm not really sure. So we haven't been around for a whole year yet because it was an asset purchase. So it's been since June and we started transactions in August. So we did inherit the contracts with the customers and all that. Good jazz. So it's good. Fortune 500 companies is good. But we wanted to make sure this is going to be a good match. A good processor that provides phone support too. You know that you guys are reliable. I went online, I didn't find any reviews much of anything. And we have another call with sky something on Monday to compare. I don't know much about the company. It's Skyline or something. And just make a decision then on which one we want to use. Just to simplify our. Simplify things.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, cool. All right, so I'm gonna, in a second here, I'll pop up in my demo environment and walk through it. The good news is everything you're looking to accomplish is our bread and butter. We're definitely gonna be able to take care of the things you're looking to do. Can you tell me a bit about. So I actually have a couple different pieces of information about your business. I know your email address I'm using here is Clear Handbags and more. The business name you put on the forum was BMG bmg.
margaritairuela: So it's BMG Supply Group doing businesses. Clear Handbags and more. In the email that I gave you is my Gmail that I'm using just for process, you know, important stuff like this so I don't miss a day to day on my clear-handbags.com email.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, so your main website is clear.cash.
margaritairuela: Handbags, clear-handbags.com and the company that you.
Jacob Greenberg: Guys acquired, was that Clear Handbags or is that a different entity?
margaritairuela: Yes, that's the one.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. Okay, cool. All right, so is all of your. Most of the people you're doing accounts with, people from. Are they distributors, like big stores? Is it all online sales? Kind of. What's the model that. Who are the people you're engaging with the most for?
margaritairuela: Accounts receivable for. For you guys, this purpose. This is going to be mostly businesses and distributors. It's going to be both. So we do retail on Shopify and other. In other stores, but we wouldn't, you know, that would be through Shopify payments.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. And you said you created a free account already. I just want to make sure that we have all your records and like consolidated in one place.
margaritairuela: Yeah. I think.
Jacob Greenberg: You created the account with.
margaritairuela: Which email you said? Yeah, yeah, it's margarita@clear-handbags.com. do you want me to type it in?
Jacob Greenberg: Nope, I could find it.
margaritairuela: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, perfect. Great. Yeah. I just want to make sure that we have everything synced up. Take this down and then I'm going to open my demo environment and show you around a little bit.
margaritairuela: Okay. And then just. Just a curiosity. So do you guys work with. So Everything works in QuickBooks Online, but do you guys work as a third party provider or do you guys do the underwriting and you're like, you know, what type of rates and all that do you have? I guess that would be one of the questions.
Jacob Greenberg: Yep. So we don't work with any third parties. We'll integrate directly with QuickBooks.
margaritairuela: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: In order to accomplish that. And we have. It's unlimited free ach. The differences here in the pricing that you're looking at is the. The nickel core platform is free to sign up unlimited free ach, but the largest individual transaction you can do is up to 25,000 per transaction.
margaritairuela: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: Nickel plus, you could do transactions greater than 25,000 per transaction and it's $35 a month if you sign up for one year.
margaritairuela: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: That's the difference. Nickel plus does have a one day, quicker turnaround time for ACH. And you can have unlimited users within your account. You can have up to three users within your nickel core account.
margaritairuela: Okay. So you said. How long does ACH take. Sorry. To process into the bank.
Jacob Greenberg: Let me pull this up for you. We can walk through this.
margaritairuela: Oh, yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: Hello.
margaritairuela: That's nice. Okay. Yeah. Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: Yep. So for Core it is a three day turnaround for ACA.
margaritairuela: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: Versus two, you have a $25,000 limit per transaction. And on the Nickel plus plan, it's a two day turnaround versus three next day turnaround per card versus two. And you have unlimited active users and no transaction.
margaritairuela: Okay. You can schedule payments in advance. So you could do. Not only receive payments, but you do bill pay as well. You do both?
Jacob Greenberg: Yep, absolutely. Okay. Okay. Are you currently doing bill pay through QuickBooks as well?
margaritairuela: Unfortunately.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay. You know.
margaritairuela: I don't know. They've been down for a week. Dude, tell me.
Jacob Greenberg: Globally, QuickBooks told you that they've been down globally for a week.
margaritairuela: Yeah, they just got their payroll back up. Right. We use them for payroll. They just got their payroll back up and that was down for how many days people weren't getting paid. So I, you see what I'm saying? Yeah, it just, it, it just. I need something that's going to be working and then I can talk to somebody if we have an issue, be like, hey, you know, you know, I don't know, some question. I know what question might come up, but I just want to make sure it works, that's all. So we can pay our bills and receive payments. Okay. So we got.
Jacob Greenberg: So sorry to hear that. That's like a big, like, bottleneck for your company to deal with. I know that QuickBooks is going through like a big process of like, they're doing a lot of changes. They're trying to get all of their quickbook desktop people onto online. They're upping their prices for ACH transfers. They're doing a lot of software migrations right now. And I'm sure that has something to do with it, but it's still an interruption to your business.
margaritairuela: Right.
Jacob Greenberg: So let me walk you through this. This is my demo account. I have some information in here. You're probably going to have more information once you say, but I'll walk you through very quickly. This is your. Just a. You know what? Actually, hold on, let me get a second environment up and running. I have one with more data that might be more useful. Okay.
margaritairuela: Now on, on both accounts, we can go ahead and, and, and charge the customer the credit card fees. And also, are you guys compliant with each state? I understand each state is different. They especially California has always got to be some more difficult.
Jacob Greenberg: Are you guys in California?
margaritairuela: No, thank God, no. Because it's very difficult. They have all these changes. I was like, oh, somebody's got to be working with them and make sure they were compliant. That's all.
Jacob Greenberg: Where are you guys? Oh, where are you guys located again?
margaritairuela: We're in Florida now. We used to be in North Carolina.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah. So actually if you come here on our website, we'll have a map of all the surcharging laws per state.
margaritairuela: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: Go ahead and click into the state that you want to see. So if you work with distributors in fair states, you can look at the laws from here. However, we will make sure that you're compliant across, across each region.
margaritairuela: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: Now, super easy. This is going to be your home screen here. Once you start having some transactions, you'll see an overview of your receivables and payables.
margaritairuela: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: You'll be able to manage all of your transactions from here. I could step back into this in a second, but it's really, really easy to see any. Do you guys use invoice numbers or like invoice purposes?
margaritairuela: Invoice inventory, invoice number. So is the invoice created here, Jacob, or is it created in QuickBooks?
Jacob Greenberg: It depends on how you want to do it. Most of our customers that use QuickBooks continue the same process they had before creating the invoice within QuickBooks and it will automatically populate in nickel right away. So I could have another tab open for QuickBooks right here. I'll create that invoice, I'll go over to nickel and I'll be able to come into my get paid section here. So. So this is where your accounts receivable process is going to live. Accounts payable will live off of this bill pay right here. But I'll hop into the get paid section and I'll be able to see my active invoice right here if it came from QuickBooks. Now if it came from QuickBooks and if you have your two way sync, you'll be able to identify that because there will be this QuickBooks logo next to those transactions. Okay, so you'll see that the sync is on right here. And you'll see on this one I don't have a sync on, so I have one environment that I'm working out of just to show you what it looks like in general and one with a QuickBooks sync. Now the invoice numbers are going to sync to QuickBooks. So if it automatically assigns an invoice number in QuickBooks, it'll also automatically assign that same number to that same invoice within nickel. So just going to pull that information right away, you'll be able to see which payments or which invoices are active if they've been sent or if they haven't been sent yet. You could just go ahead and click Request payment and you can send it via text or email and I'll show you what it looks like from the customer side as well. You can also very easily filter for just your unsent invoices. So say you generate 50 invoices in one week, pop in a nickel, select all the unsent ones and just click send and you'll automatically send all of your invoices at once that haven't been sent.
margaritairuela: Okay, so do we save it as a draft then in QuickBooks and then come here and that's that's the final step.
Jacob Greenberg: Yep. So once you complete it in, once you complete it within QuickBooks, it'll automatically here and whenever you're ready to send it, you come into Nickel to send, send or receive your invoices. And once they come in here and they've been paid, it'll be marked as completed and you'll see the amount that's been paid and the amount for the invoice when it was due and when it was completed. And all this information will automatically push back into QuickBooks. So there's no extra steps required. Your books are automatically kept up to date.
margaritairuela: Okay, let's say that I send an invoice and I want. I wanted to populate both credit card and ach. How does that do that unless I create it straight from nickel?
Jacob Greenberg: Right. So I'm going to show you what that looks like. It's a good question. So I'm going to create one from Nickel just to show you the process of creating it. But then I'll also show you what it looks like when one comes in from QuickBooks. Okay.
margaritairuela: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: So if I wanted to create one from within Nickel, I just go to create new invoice. I'll pick the customer that I want to, or I can add the new customer. The invoice number, I can either manually add it or if it's synced with QuickBooks, it'll be automatically added. All of your settings in QuickBooks will be here. So whatever you put for like line items or details on your typical invoice, this will be here as well. And then you just pick. Do you ever have recurring invoices or is it all one time invoices.
margaritairuela: One time usually.
Jacob Greenberg: So you just select one time, the date that you're creating the invoice and the date that it's due. So do you guys ever do like 30 day, 45 day net terms or is it always asap payments?
margaritairuela: It depends on the company.
Jacob Greenberg: So you pick the date that you want to tell them, hey, this payment is due by this date. Memo notes for customers and you could upload any documents you want. So you can do this after you generate within QuickBooks or if you create it within nickel. So if you have like a net terms agreement or photos of the product or shipping, anything that you want to consolidate communications in one place, you could do that. And then before I create this, you'll see this advanced tab where you can turn on some customizations here. So one of these is you could customize the fees on the payment request. So how much you want to pass, you want to put all of the potential credit card rate onto the customer should they choose to pay it. So we'll keep that at 100. And I'm just going to hop down here and click create and I'm just going to show you what it looks like to send this invoice. So we'll find this invoice here as unnamed invoice. This is the one that we just created together. Now you all of these say this was created within QuickBooks. It would just populate here automatically. I'm going to pop into this, click get paid and I'm just going to send this link so you can put the customer phone number it'll send as a text message or you can put their email in and send. I'll show you my slightly messy inbox and I'll see this will be your company name here and your logo. I'll say you have a new payment request. I click pay now and this is what that port that portal would look like.
margaritairuela: Nice. Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: And your company name, the amount, any PDF documents that you attach. So again, net term agreements, contracts that you have with that customer, line item, invoices, photos of the shipment, anything that you want to include in this portal you can include as attachments. If you've had previous transactions with this customer, they would populate below this tab here so they can see all their previous transaction history with you and then they'd be able to choose to pay by card or choose to pay by bank. They'll see that it is free, they're are no fees to pay by bank and they'll see that they incur a 2.99% fee to pay by card should they choose to pay by card. We still find that roughly 20 to 22% of the time customers end up deciding to pay by card anyway because it gives them a little bit cash flow advantage. They have more time to pay it off and most people these days have a 3% cashback card to begin with so it doesn't really matter. But yeah. So these are the options that you're looking for here. If it's a one time payment and you don't do business with this customer, often they just put in this information and click pay and that would be paid and you come back in here and you'll be able to click into completed and it will populate here as a paid invoice that's been completed. Very easy to manage and it will automatically update that in your footprints as well. If it is a customer that you do business with on and off. You can send them a request for their banking information. They can upload it into nicl, store it within nickel. We will be responsible for PCI compliance, we'll be responsible for stock tube compliance. We'll keep your customers data safe so that you don't have to worry about all of those regulations on doing it on your own. And then you can auto charge them if they opt in. So if you do have customers that you work with more frequently, maybe send a shipment once a month or once every other month. You could have them grant you permission just to charge their card after they update payment method. Instead of coming here to request payment, I just go ahead and click go to active ones, I can just go ahead to charge payment method on file. Their information would be here and I just click charge customer and I'll automatically withdraw.
margaritairuela: What about, what about any late fees or reminders like you, you would like.
Jacob Greenberg: To impose late fees upon a customer?
margaritairuela: Yeah, we have a handful that are getting a little testy. Two of them, I mean they only owe like a thousand dollars but it's like always chasing them. They always got to be you know, 70 days or something. It's like everybody else is doing that. 30, you got, you know, there's only a couple. So you know, do we send the reminders via QuickBooks or, or so you.
Jacob Greenberg: Can send the reminders from here. So see how I already sent this payment request on the 10th, so two days ago, if I just click send reminder it will send another reminder. All I need to do is press this button.
margaritairuela: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: However, if you do want to impose late fees, you could come into this and you can edit the invoice and you could update the amount.
margaritairuela: Okay. I mean I don't think we'll have for those particular ones, we can always update them out on QuickBooks because we have a late fee option in QuickBooks. So you just revise it there Invoice. Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: You could filter for all of your transactions that have an end date of let's say last month or two weeks ago. Right. Like these were all due in the past. They're all overdue. And then what you can do is just go ahead and you know, edit them and update the cost accordingly if you wanted to.
margaritairuela: Okay. And then what are your non disclosure terms? Because a lot of these guys, they're big distributors and so we have to keep their end customer, you know, security safe, you know, data safe and all that. What is, what do you guys have some of that in the terms where we can Send it to them.
Jacob Greenberg: So just so I better understand. Walk me through that one more time. What, what information specifically are you trying to keep?
margaritairuela: So we have a lot of distributors that, that, that you know, that we drop ship from. So we drop ship a lot of stuff on behalf of other people. And so they have contracts and we have things that you know, say, hey, there's a non disclosure associated with any tools, anything that you use. So for example, you know, the partners that we work with, we, we have NDAs with them. I don't know if you guys have one in your terms or you have an nd, a standard NDA that you sign so to let them know that their data is going to be not disclosed. Does that make sense?
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah. One thing you can do. So there's a couple pieces of information. So if they wanted to review our security protocols, they could just pop into this page and you could share this with them. Unless we're storing their personal information and saving it on your page. It's just like using specific banking app, so it really wouldn't be necessary. But if you did request customer information to be uploaded directly into the portal, it would look something like this. And I'll show you. So if you wanted to add that customer payment information to keep it stashed within Mickle, instead of us just processing the transaction, send an email like this. Instead of it saying nickel demo, it would have your company name and have your company logo and have your company name here and you complete the payment method form. And this would be the workflow. So three quick steps. First, just the overview page saying what the authorization is for. Who is nickel? How are we protecting? Is it soft to compliant, et cetera, et cetera. Okay, get started. And then you review and accept these terms. You can click here for the terms and conditions, which you can share this as well.
margaritairuela: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: And then you click next step. And then you would be able to upload your bank account or card information. Then you're storing it within. Other than requesting we store this information on your behalf to make payments easier in the future, there really wouldn't be a need to sign a specific contract.
margaritairuela: Right.
Jacob Greenberg: But you can review our terms of service if you want to.
margaritairuela: Yeah, this is, this is perfect. Yeah. Just so they know that all the information that they gave us and whatever's on the invoice, yada yada. Is everybody I know every customer has their own little thing, you know and you know that's fine. Okay, perfect. Well, I think we have all the information we need. We'll be making A decision next week because we really need to. We didn't think we needed to. We thought, hey, you know, QuickBooks would be all good. But we, the company used to use QuickBooks Desktop never had an issue. But now it seems that going over to QuickBooks Online they said it's not as robust. I thought the other one was a dinosaur. So I'm not willing to go back to that. And we may need a, a more robust option, you know, somebody to work with us here. But yeah, no, I really appreciate it. So we'll be getting back to you then, Jacob, by next week. Like I said, we'll make a decision. I have one more call on, on Monday and then we'll just have to pick a processor. But I like that you guys do bill pay and you know, and also.
Jacob Greenberg: I know we only have three minutes, but I didn't even show you the bill pay sign. But it's very much, it's essentially the same as the accounts receiving just with one quicker step because you're not requesting. So you're going to be able to organize and manage it the same way, super easy. Automatically sent QuickBooks again completely free, ACH unlimited. And you pass the 2.9% on a customer card.
margaritairuela: Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: Or I know you said you had another evaluation this week and you're going to make a decision next week. What is the other company that you're going to be checking out?
margaritairuela: I have a call with them on Monday. It's called Skyline Payments.
Jacob Greenberg: Skyline payment. Okay.
margaritairuela: Yeah, yeah, I'll touch base. I'll let you guys know sometime next week. I think it's like end of day on, on Monday or after 3 o' clock on Monday. So I'll touch base with them. And then like I said, our team needs to make a decision because we just want to invoice everybody the same. And right now I have the bookkeeper going all over the place between two things. Nothing's working and we just can't have it. And oh, international ach. If I need to pay a factory, do I do it through my bank or do I do it through you guys? I mean it's not a big deal, but.
Jacob Greenberg: It'Ll happen to an international company or receive a payment from an international company. That the question.
margaritairuela: No, we might have to pay our factory, you know, every few months we have to pay our fact, you know, depending on what we're manufacturing and usually we do it through the bank. Would we do that one through the bank since it's an international ach or would we do it through your bill pay doesn't matter.
Jacob Greenberg: As long as you bank within the United States and your bank is here, you can do it. You can do it through.
margaritairuela: Okay. Yeah, it's bank of America. Okay. All right, perfect. So I will let you guys know and then all I got to do is what? Unlock my credit. You guys just run the credit report and we fill out whatever application.
Jacob Greenberg: You said you already created your account. So what happens is just make sure to when you create your account, link the business bank account. Don't link your personal one. Make sure sure to do that, the one associated with clear handbags. And then go ahead. You might see some onboarding steps once you create your account and then just complete those and you can start transacting.
margaritairuela: Okay, perfect. All right. Just want to make sure. Okay, great. So we'll be in touch. Thanks for making yourself available. Such short notice. Thank you, Jacob. I appreciate it.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, we were able to connect and I'm just going to put a reminder on my calendar to touch base with you towards the end of next week because I. That. Okay, perfect.
margaritairuela: Yeah, that's great.
Jacob Greenberg: Maybe same time next Friday? I'll just send a little reminder out.
margaritairuela: Yes, that's fine. Thank you. You have a great weekend.
Jacob Greenberg: You too. All right. Bye, Margarita.
margaritairuela: Bye.
Jacob Greenberg: Bye.
