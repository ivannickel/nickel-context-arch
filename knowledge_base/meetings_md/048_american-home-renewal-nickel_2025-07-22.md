Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, it sounds like he said he confirmed it. It's going well, just got off another call. But yeah, we're excited to talk with these guys and test out that first kind of sending of $50.
Ivan LaBianca: Yeah, nice. Looks like a solid subcontractor, Windows and siding, right?
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, so these guys, they have a ton of really positive reviews, but Window sliding and door installation primarily.
Marc: Cool.
Ivan LaBianca: I will probably just sit here mostly on mute, but feel free to loop me in if you need anything or I'll chime in.
Marc: Yeah, yeah. Of course.
Colton O'Farrell: Company that comes out to measure that would measure them the same. Hey, Marc.
Marc: All right, dude, I gotta run. Sorry, it's 11. I'll call you back. Bye. What's up, guys?
Colton O'Farrell: Hey, Marc, it's great to meet you. How's it going today?
Ivan LaBianca: Good.
Marc: You hear me okay?
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, I can hear you great. Can you hear us okay?
Marc: I don't know why the video is not working, but I am kind of ugly, but we can try anyway. Just see you guys.
Colton O'Farrell: Not a problem. Well, hey, as long as you can hear us, that's kind of most important. But Marc, really want to thank you so much for taking some time to meet with us. I know we had some kind of technical issues before, so glad we could get you on the call today. Goal here is just to understand a little bit more about your business, kind of how AR and AP are working today, where some areas that Nickel maybe would be able to assist with, kind of by minute 10, we're going to show you what it would look like for you to set up as a vendor and we'll pay you 50 bucks.
Marc: Just to show you.
Colton O'Farrell: That's great.
Ivan LaBianca: Yeah.
Marc: Then you receive payments.
Colton O'Farrell: But yeah, just curious, Marc, though, kind of, you know, you replied to Ray in the email here, just curious what really piqued your interest, what you got going on today, the challenges you're dealing with, and yeah, great place to start.
Marc: Well, we use obviously QuickBooks. We use bill.com and pay bills. That's what we're currently using. And QuickBooks has just launched a product takeoutbill.com, it looks like, but I hate into it so much, I'd probably avoid that. I don't know if you guys are doing that direction. As far as payments, most of our stuff is check. Most of our clients paying to be a check. More and more people want to wire. And I guess I've avoided ETFs, which I think is what I, what I call you do electronic fun tofts. So I think QuickBooks, not that it's a lot, but I think they were charging a dollar or whatever. And it just, I don't know, clients rarely ask for it, but it might be nice to have a, which I think the direction of what you guys do, something that everyone's kind of getting more and more electronic. You know, we don't have the old grannies anymore that are signing paper contracts. All our contracts are docu-signed. So it kind of fits. We've been using Salesforce from 2007. I've been, you know, so we're very electronic records and have been for quite a while.
Ivan LaBianca: Hey, Mark, you mind if I just ask, when do people request wires specifically? I got one this morning.
Marc: They're like, they basically tell us they're going to be wiring in what's the banking information. So more and more of that's happening. Then, of course, my production manager says, can you log into the bank and tell me if we got it? We haven't got it yet. All right, I'll leave it on my list, you know, to Make sure we get it or I'll chase the client. It's like, There's a little bit of back and forth because I'm not letting my production managers are responsible to make sure we receive payment, you know, going in my bank necessarily. Yeah. That's why I have to kind of get between them on that. Yeah. Well, I got a solution there that might make things easier if we use EFTs.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, absolutely. Marc, I was curious, are you guys.
Marc: Is it QuickBooks Desktop that you have or QuickBooks Online?
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, online, unfortunately. We left desktop a couple of years ago, unfortunately. That's not a problem for us. We actually have a native integration with QuickBooks Online. I think I saw that, yeah. Yeah, it's everything that's done in QuickBooks Online will be real-time synced to QuickBooks and vice versa to Nickel. What we would do is we would generate a secured payment link. You can send that either via email or text to your customers. They would receive that once they click the pay now option and I'll walk you through that. They can either pay for free via ACH or they can pay with the 2.99% fee. By default, 100% of credit card surcharges will be paid for by your customer. We can adjust the global rule if you'd like, or we could also do it on an individual invoice level. For example, if you agreed that you wanted to split like a surcharge with one customer, we give you that control as well. You said you're paying bills with bill.com, just curious if you could explain a little bit more about the setup that you have with them and how that's working for you.
Marc: So I have the five, I think I have the five license, that's probably the middle one. where five licenses. So there's permission sets and obviously there's approvals and such. So my wife has a role. She just works from home. A little bit of getting the bills entered as they come up visually. She gets it entered into, you know, the format that eventually is going to go over to QuickBooks. And then some bills get pushed to other people to be approved. Some of the production managers will look at some of the bills, and then ultimately, I approve ultimately all of them, and I pay them. I'm the president of the company, so I, I just I just want to be involved in that, look at everything. So- what's the rate?
Colton O'Farrell: So are you paying those bills generally via credit card, via ACH? No, they're ACH.
Marc: They come right out of the thing. The credit cards, it's like 3%. I wouldn't do that because even with the rewards we get, it's never worth it. Plus we wouldn't get terms from a lot of our vendors. We get 1 and 2% terms from a lot of vendors. So I'm all about paying
Colton O'Farrell: fast. Right, no, and that makes sense. Just helpful to understand kind of what you're doing currently. Mark, so what I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead and share my screen quick, and I'm going to walk you through what it would look like. So we're going to set you up as a vendor here. We're going to send you a payment of $50 via Nickel. So once you would log into Nickel, I'll quickly show you the integration with QuickBooks Online as well. So you just go to integrations right here, you click this green link QuickBooks account button. you go to the QuickBooks page, sign in, select your company, chart of accounts. Once you do so, everything would flow into an accounts receivable perspective here, as well as an accounts payable perspective here. So I'm going to go ahead and add you as a vendor. So we're going to do, and when you do that integration, all your customers, all your vendors, everything will be brought over so you won't have to worry about it. But if we're going to manually add you as a vendor, so I just go to new vendor. If I have your information, I can enter it.
Marc: If no, we can send you a.
Colton O'Farrell: Form to fill out. So I'm going to enter your name, Newell Incorporated, your email address right there. We have some toggleable features if we want to turn those on. I don't just go ahead and do invite. So you'll get an email here in just a moment if you want to let me know if you got that.
Marc: There it is. Fill out vendor details. Why am I being asked to do this? What is Nickel? Is this secure? Yes, yes, yes. Get started.
Colton O'Farrell: Perfect. Alright, well I'm gonna make that payment to you now. Gonna pay you just with our credit card right here. And it's gonna have that timeframe of when we're gonna be sending it. So I'm gonna hit review and pay. Whoops.
Marc: You guys using a credit card? Okay, so you pay the... You have.
Ivan LaBianca: Maybe showing that screen just a little bit more, Colton, actually. You have the option to do To pay via credit card or your bank either and there's no fee on the ACH side and then a.
Marc: Okay, I want to talk to you about the credit card thing because I use Reddit Depot. I signed up with them a long time ago. They were the ones that were like a thousand dollars a year. You pay us upfront and you get really low fees compared to the other ones. I've since they've since they've come down to 500 because I kind of bitched about it once. But I save all my actual things monthly of what I pay, what they put in my bank versus what they charged. And they're above three on average. Are you saying if I used you as my processor, it's literally exactly 2.9 across the board, everything? So if somebody we charge us a $10,000 card I'm gonna get whatever minus 2.9 290 so you know accounts receivable.
Colton O'Farrell: Is 2.99 and then accounts payable is.
Marc: 2.90. so let's just round up to three percent I'm gonna there's no other fees there's no monthly there's no PCI.
Colton O'Farrell: Merchant there's there's these no no hidden fees so I can explain that the pricing standpoint so we have two I.
Marc: Might be a better client for you on this side of it than the even the ACH thing Yeah, so how.
Colton O'Farrell: It'S set up with us, so we have two different plans. We have our Nickel Core Plan primarily designed for small businesses. There are some limitations there. Not sure it would really fit with what you guys are doing, but the main limitations are that on the free plan, we do cap ACH transactions at $20.
Marc: Yeah, that wouldn't work. We've got stuff that people put huge amounts on a credit card.
Colton O'Farrell: So that's the main plan. So if you're on the Nickel Plus Plan, which is our most popular, it's either $45 monthly or $35 a month with an annual subscription. So 20% discount. We allow for up to a million dollars per transaction on the Nickel Plus plan. You can also do recurring payments, you can schedule payments in advance. We are still required to get the ACH transfers completed before the cutoff times of 4:00 PM Eastern Standard Time.
Marc: I don't care about timing or even the turnarounds or cut-offs. We don't run on fumes here. So I can see where that's interest to, like, I have a lot of contractor friends that are like, oh my God, they're freaking about money every minute. We just- Right, cash flow problems. Yeah, we keep money in a bank. So unlimited free ACH to the client and to us, two-day turnaround, that's fine. 2.99 is going to be incoming.
Colton O'Farrell: Accounts receivable, yep. And that's it.
Marc: Yep, that's it.
Colton O'Farrell: No other monthly fees.
Marc: No other monthly fees. being with Nick.
Colton O'Farrell: Correct.
Marc: The only time 35 times 12 is when you know it real quick is 360 and 60. 420 a year. 420. You're bad. You guys are bad. For 420 a year, you're 80 dollars less than them. And I'm 299 dead stop. No, because.
Colton O'Farrell: Correct.
Marc: Just bowl. ah. Oh, here we go. Yeah. When I. I don't see these. When I get my payment Tivo, that's what I've been using. Yeah, they're a processor. And they were cheaper than the other ones I was using. When I look at what I got paid and the. The fees charged, I usually. I. I don't know why it's not here. Yeah, I Circle it. Yeah. 4.1. four percent. I'm like 2.79. This was a small month, 7.7% because the fees were high. The smaller the month is the worse they are because of but three would be better for me. 2.99. Yeah.
Colton O'Farrell: So going to explain that there's no other fees associated. Only the only chance that you would be. So this is ours within settings here. So by default, if your customer wants to pay you on the accounts receivable side via credit card, We don't think you should have to eat that cost unless you want to. So by default, 100% of that cost will be paid for by your customer. This is a global rule, so you can override it and this will impact all of your customers. So if you wanted to split it 50/50, you could do that. If you wanted to eat the cost, you could. But again, by default, it's just going to be set up at 100%.
Marc: However, we- yeah, we- my sales reps, when they sell something, if they ask them how they're paying, if they do, they use a different price. So it's preset. So if they're using a credit card, we've already agreed to eat it and they've paid a higher amount. So I probably, can I global set.
Colton O'Farrell: It that we always pay it?
Marc: Yeah, absolutely. And then I could go in the way if we were gonna split it or if we, they were gonna pay it because they said cash, we gave them a cash price, but now they're like, hey, can we use a credit card? I would change it on them and then make them pay it because that.
Colton O'Farrell: Wasn'T what we agreed to.
Marc: Okay. Yep. And then, and all that functionality, is it, in QuickBooks and or Nickel because if it's a Nickel then I can allow my production managers to go in and do that which would take the burden off of me.
Colton O'Farrell: If it's in QuickBooks.
Marc: Yep, it'll be within Nickel as well here. It's in with a Nickel and because I noticed on the medium plan that I pay for, I have multiple users so I could say, hey, if that Johnson job that was based for cash is now going credit card, they go in and I would show them how to send them the
Ivan LaBianca: fee. You should show them the payment link because basically, what you're doing right now is what a lot of the businesses we talked to do, where you have to figure out how they're going to pay up charge to basically then eat the cost, right? But you're actually up charging for it. But what we do is basically give them the option.
Marc: You send- yeah, if you're just giving me everything to do it, and if it's in nickel outside of QuickBooks, because In QuickBooks, I have them gatekept off some, I've given them logins, but they can't get certain things and I'm not sure to be able to get to this. But if the functionality to change who's getting charged is a nickel and I can get my users in there, they don't see all my financial information on how much money I'm making this and that, which is why I want them out of QuickBooks, then this is great.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, and I was gonna show you quickly, so that global setting, if you wanted to eat the cost, you would just have it that you're 100% eating.
Marc: The cost, you're cost- that would be the more common, so I would globally set it that way. and then obviously change it case by case.
Colton O'Farrell: And then this is the case by case how you do it.
Marc: All right, got it.
Colton O'Farrell: When to advance here, you'd go to this bottom side here and you just customize it. So if you wanted to split it 50/50 for this one invoice, this is what it would look like. If you wanted to disable credit card payments, you could do that as well. But I'm just going to go ahead and show what it looks like from generating within Nickel and sending that to your customer. So here's that secured payment link right here. We're going to send that either via email or via SMS to your customer. I'm going to go ahead and send that off, but in case you wanted to see what it looked like prior to sending to your customer, this is what they would see here. So this is an example of where I did the 50/50 split. So the card on the fee on this side would be 1.47%. It would show your name, email, logo, invoice name or number. The invoice would be attached right there. And then it'd be two.
Ivan LaBianca: Yes.
Marc: That invoice is out of QuickBooks.
Colton O'Farrell: Yes. So if we're synced with QuickBooks, everything from QuickBooks would be brought over and sent out. What it looks like on the email perspective is right here. So your customer would get an email that looks just like this showing American Home Renewal Incorporated. So you have a new payment request, same kind of information as before, invoice attached. If they reply to the email, you'll be CC'd on communication. And when they hit pay now, it's.
Marc: Again just that same screen that you guys, I noticed on the bottom, you're always offering them the ability to avoid the fee by said pay with ACH now it's free.
Ivan LaBianca: Can you go back?
Marc: Yeah.
Ivan LaBianca: That's right. So they have the option to choose. So you don't have to, because you were saying you don't actually Eat the fee, you build it in, you surcharge it, right?
Marc: So for example, if our cash price was five grand, we usually have a five percent. The reps do a waterfall price. We're like, oh, if you're gonna use our, we have financing too. If you're gonna use financing, it's six thousand. If you don't need to use financing, you want to use a credit card, we can do it for 5250. And we go for a cash discount. We spin it half, you know, glass half full, glass half empty. Oh, and by the way, if you could pay cash check at the end of the job, ACH. It would be 5,000. But what happens sometimes is sometimes at the end, people are like, they try to, you know, because Divide and Conquer, the reps train them on that. But now they're here with the crews, we're all done, they're happy, and the crews are putting their hand out to get paid because they collect. And then they're like, oh, I'd like to use a credit card. And it's like, wait a second. Now we had a different number for a credit card. So I love that you have the functionality that I can change it because we can then go back and show them, hey, there was a different price originally, credit card. We gave you a cash discount. you can't use the credit card at the same number. So that's on our end, our issue. As long as you have the functionality that we can, I can allow the people that aren't me to go in and deal with this, we're good.
Colton O'Farrell: It looks good. Awesome, absolutely. Any particular questions you have about the workflow or yeah, anything that kind of comes up? No, you know, it's hitting me fast.
Marc: I'd have to, you know, I'm someone that's so visual, I'd have to play with it, get in it. It's an ask, any chance Usually if I'm going to do something like this and commit, because I would just do the year, we wouldn't play the $45 per month. I want the better discount and I, if we're going to commit to it, we want to do it. But would you throw me an audition period of, oh, you do have 14 days.
Colton O'Farrell: There it is.
Marc: Yep. Yeah, I gotta audition it just to make sure. Of course. There's integration pain with anything and just kind of see, all right, when this happens, then I'll have Keith do this and I have to tell Rod, I gotta figure that stuff out. So the other support would even be...
Ivan LaBianca: We're happy if you need to jump on a call to get integrated, it's very simple.
Marc: Yeah, I can do that.
Ivan LaBianca: Or it's very, very responsive in that. We can also schedule something for you.
Marc: Is there any reason I'd want to look at the custom and talk to you guys about this? Can you show me the value prop on the third one? Unlimited to the adult care custom rate.
Ivan LaBianca: How much volume are you doing?
Marc: I know I was gonna ask on the credit card or on, I mean, just overall, almost a million dollars a month.
Ivan LaBianca: A million dollars a month.
Marc: Okay. But a lot of that rights now check, if there was a reason for me to really say, hey, we're almost becoming a paperless company on payment, then I'd need to hear that from you.
Colton O'Farrell: Absolutely. Yeah, I would say, you know, the majority of our customers are on the Nickel Plus plan. What are you guys doing? So you said it's about a million dollars monthly.
Marc: Well, that's what my sales are all paid. I'd say, you know, most of it's check. We're processing a lot of checks. Little ACH, little wire. What's a bloom in some actual hard cash, but that's weird. It's 95% checks. Well, we find- We're 10 to 12 million in sales annually. We've been around 28 years. We're a decent sized contractor.
Ivan LaBianca: The thing we find is that a lot of customers, the reason people pay checks is, you think about it, you have to go into your bank to do those right now. Your business owner, so writing a check is much easier.
Marc: We have a check reader that the bank was like, Here's a free reader.
Ivan LaBianca: Well, no, not on the receiving check. What I'm saying is that for your customers experience, if you send them your routing number and all that, one thing is there's a security risk with it, obviously, to have them send an ACH or something like that. But the second part is that there's just a hassle factor to it versus you see how simple that link is, how simple it was to basically be able to make a payment. What we find is a lot of people move over to the ACH. once you give them the option. So you can say you can write a check or here's a link.
Marc: You just- Right, I understand. Especially here in the- I mean, it.
Ivan LaBianca: Wouldn'T surprise me if you get 70%.
Marc: Of people- yeah, you know, I'm sure we could nudge this and we can make it happen by creating a new company culture whereby, hey, we kind of really don't, I mean, you can write a check. The pain point for us realistically is without giving you too much background, because I'm sure you have another call to get to. We take no money till the job's done. We have a very unusual satisfaction policy that none of our competitors do. So we don't take very high customer.
Colton O'Farrell: Reviews too, I noticed.
Marc: Yeah, we take no money till the job's done. It's part of the reason we people go with us is they're like, wow, I've never heard of dealing with a contractor. $70,000 window contract. I don't pay you anything. You don't pay us anything till the job's done, you're happy. That's how confident we are. Then, but you damn well bet when we're done, My crews are trained to go, great, here's your document that you filled out everything, blah, blah, blah. Great, I need a check for $70,000. And they become, there's social pressure of a person right there. Yeah. All these things involve them leaving and then my production manager from behind sending us and then they are in charge now of paying us. And so the immediacy of the check, there's something there about you pay us now. We don't have mobile devices in our guys hands, but I love the idea if we did for them to go, great, here's a link for you to do it. But I can't imagine somebody getting their banking information in my guys phones. It's that sort of, I'm trying to bring you to the moment of when we get paid. Why this will be great for the times we can't get paid, the client's not home that day in my production manager to send it out. But why I can almost still see staying in the check world because it's a control issue. We're very sensitive about, you already didn't pay us anything, now we're gonna leave and send a link and wait. It's bothersome to me. It's like, you know, but we want to get paid when we're done at that moment.
Colton O'Farrell: Absolutely. Marc, something else that might be beneficial to you and I just wanted to quickly show you this is for every customer that also gets set up with Nickel in addition to like sending off an individualized Link via email or text like I showed you. We also give every customer access to this payment portal here. It's completely customizable. Most of our customers will take this and embed it in their own website to serve as a one-stop shop for customers to make a payment or as a backup method. Because what they can do is they can come in here, enter any amount, the reason. So if they had a project that they were doing for you, they could just come in here, make the payment with the 2.99%. That's again set up with the global rules. So if you adjust that, You know, that would reflect there.
Marc: So you're saying they see value in, I was going to ask you because doesn't your thing require like I had to do it was very quick, but for them to pay me, you're sort of getting names and addresses, which, you know, there's something I understand the way these things work. It's like the more you get that on, the more eyes, the more logins. You actually need value in doing that for other things for themselves personally.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, so we don't require any customers to, your customers don't have to use Nickel. They can still complete payments as long as they have access to email or a phone. If they like to set up and use us, they can. And we do have, like there's some emails that we can send them. So for customers who are doing, like on the Plus plan, we can set up a payment authorization request, which would allow you just to pull from their account based on agreed upon criteria. So you could set transaction limits, when that would expire. This is what they would see. So we'll always send them frequently asked questions with answers. But if that's too long and they didn't read it, we do again have it on the next screen here. So it's letting them know that Nickel SOC2 compliant, all their information is protected with us. We handle all the PCI compliance. If there's any credit card fees, all the money is always yours. We're moving it in FDIC insured accounts. Nothing's ever living in Nickel. And this lets them know that this authorization can be revoked at any time. But what it would look like is if there was a transaction limit, you would have that in here. If there's no limit, like this example or no expiration date, they would just confirm, accept, how they want to pay that. Once they hit complete on that, you would just be able to auto pull from their account based on this approval that they've given to you.
Marc: Not sure if that would be super helpful. Yeah, I can't imagine.
Ivan LaBianca: I don't see the value. What's that? Mostly one-off jobs, is that right?
Marc: Like you're not working with the same person over and over. Nah, yeah, I mean we get repeat.
Ivan LaBianca: Clients, but it's like, you know, six months later, oh, we want some more windows. What I was saying with that payments portal is that you can run that on mobile. And it doesn't actually require as much information as you probably put in. I believe you just need an account number, basically. So you could, in the same way, literally just copy the information off the check that they, in the same amount of time, would take them to write the check to the person. You could have them be like, oh yeah, you can pay us via card or ACH right now and just get it done on site. And they don't even have to- so.
Marc: Walk me through, here's my installer. He's saying we're done and the client's happy and ready to pay us, which.
Ivan LaBianca: Is normally the case.
Marc: They're taking their mobile phone, the client's.
Ivan LaBianca: Mobile phone or our mobile. You could do it a couple ways. You could send them a link.
Marc: I mean, the easiest thing, you just.
Ivan LaBianca: Send them the link and say, so.
Marc: Okay, we're right there. Hey, the way you pay us. And they pay it right away.
Ivan LaBianca: Here's a link. And so my guy would retrain our installers to send them a link. And it's that link you saw. So the difference between that link and the one that he sent in the email is this one is from an invoice in QuickBooks, right? And you can do that if you have that ready to go, but you can also use the portal here. Basically, you can set the amount. So if you have a paper invoice or something, they can just, you can basically anybody can pay you at any time. It's kind of funny because these links live on your website. And so in theory, somebody could just come. We actually had somebody that just for some reason paid us randomly. So it's basically just a place where you can Oh, you can receive payments very easily for any amount and enter in the reason for the payment.
Marc: Yeah, I gotta wrap this process around the realities of our situation. That's what I'm trying to, and I'm not 14. You guys can't, well, if I can't get it, if I can't figure it out in 14 days, would you, have you ever extended it a little bit if I need it?
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, I'd be more than happy to give you a month payment, month.
Marc: Yeah, I mean, I'm hot and bothered right now and this seems great. I have to think about, I'm fine with integration pain because very often there's integration pain, there's pot of gold in the rainbow once we've figured it out. And then looking back, we was like, oh, we never should have done it that way. And I think I see the promise of that year. And I've been thinking about something like this, you guys hit me at the right time. But it's this need to get paid immediately then. And then how, you know, a lot of our guys installers are also Ukrainian or Latin guys. Communicating in English is, I mean, they all speak English, but communicating is why they're installers and then we're in sales and you guys are too. It's not there, I have to make it so freaking easy and I got to think about if we would even send the code out, the production managers would do that in advance. So maybe these, I have to think about this. But I like the idea and if you can give me, yeah, 14 to 30 days. Yeah, am I already open and playing with it?
Colton O'Farrell: Yes, so all you need to do is create an account, link a payment method.
Marc: Once you do that, you're able to-.
Colton O'Farrell: I thought I did do it.
Ivan LaBianca: What you did was just to receive a payment?
Marc: No, I think I did before I.
Ivan LaBianca: Even- oh, you did create one.
Colton O'Farrell: Okay, so you're in.
Ivan LaBianca: All right.
Marc: Yes, we'll turn the page and see. I think I'm officially in there. Yes, I'm in. Now I think I just have to link it with a chart of accounts or whatever, and then I guess I have to play, I have to, I'm open, right? Let me, I guess I need to play with it and think about and maybe contact you if you've been on.
Ivan LaBianca: Yeah, Marc, it might be good to schedule a follow-up because it's, if there's someone on your team that would be using it a lot also, and we can just make sure we get, because it sounds like you got a lot of little edge cases and that's it. Background. So, so how do I go?
Marc: Do you have to get off the call?
Ivan LaBianca: Because I know these are a few minutes over.
Marc: Okay. Should I log into my nickel? How do I get in? I'm in this one that you did, but is this a different version of the one I did the other day when I got in?
Colton O'Farrell: Yes, that was just to set you up so that we could pay you out. But you set up an account as well just for yourself.
Marc: So you know, I think I did for the company.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep, yep, I did see that come through. So you would just log into the account that you had created.
Marc: And that's, I'm finding that, I mean, obviously I'll I'll link it and give it a, but it was Nickel Payments or how do I find it?
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, you can go to nickel.com, get nickel.com, all right.
Marc: Okay, get nickel, there it is. It might pre-login, all right, login. Yeah, this was the pretty purple, okay. It's all welcome back. All right, here we go, summary transactions get paid bill pay. So this is what I should be, is this like the same screen I would see at the middle $35 a month thing? this is, this is it.
Ivan LaBianca: Exactly. You just have different transaction limits and slightly faster payment reconciliation. That's it.
Marc: Right. So once I pay, then you're gonna, the limits are gonna come out. Okay. So I guess I have to go through this thing and kind of, yeah, I think I think, I think I need to audition it first. And then as I get my arms wrapped around it, then I would, oh, by the way, this happened by mistake. It says my display name is Andy Stelzer. My name is Marc with a C. It says I have to contact you guys to change it.
Colton O'Farrell: Can you do it?
Marc: Yes, absolutely. It auto filled something.
Colton O'Farrell: I didn't catch it. No worries, yeah.
Marc: We'll adjust that for you, Mark. No worries. Yeah, thanks. M-A-R-C. And I even tried to upload.
Colton O'Farrell: Like a banner and stuff and I didn't get that figured out.
Marc: But okay, so I'll play with this. Do you want us Friday at the same time?
Colton O'Farrell: Just a quick sync up. Yeah, why don't we pre-book something if.
Marc: You guys are down with that.
Colton O'Farrell: That way there's for sure follow
Marc: up. Yes, I'll
Colton O'Farrell: send that right now for you. So we'll do the same time Friday. This Friday? Yeah, this Friday. Does that work for you? Let me double check. Otherwise we can do next week as well.
Marc: Yeah, let's do, we're going to do Monday, you got afternoon 28th.
Colton O'Farrell: See, Monday the 28th at the same time?
Marc: A little later.
Colton O'Farrell: What works for you? I'm wide open, so you just let me know. Yep, that works perfect.
Ivan LaBianca: It's too Pacific for you, yeah?
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, yeah.
Marc: Where are you guys located?
Colton O'Farrell: So I'm in Chicago.
Ivan LaBianca: I'm actually in the New York office.
Marc: Just so you know. But yeah, I'm from New York.
Colton O'Farrell: Oh, nice.
Marc: Colton, yeah.
Colton O'Farrell: Well, I'm sending this right now, Marc.
Marc: All right, 2 p.m.
Ivan LaBianca: I've got an invite, I think. If we could, I think it'd be great to walk through exactly your workflow with you on that call. Mostly on the AR side, but a little bit on the AP side and just make sure, because there's a couple of different tools that you could use to accomplish what you were saying, moving that process to maybe move away from, because I get the huge value of getting that payment at that time and seeing your reviews and how you've done that and you want to follow up, that's the moment to get paid. And I think there's a couple of ways that we can enable that. One of them might be actually using what Colton was showing you, that debit authorization. Do you do a contract up front? Yeah, so you could probably get an authorization that basically would allow you to auto debit the account at the completion of the job if they sign the contract or something like that would be one way to do it. But yeah, we can talk about it on.
Marc: Yeah, boy, there's some people that'll be like, no, no, no, I'm gonna, I'll be writing you a check or I'll ACH or I'll wire it in.
Ivan LaBianca: Just fine, they could still do.
Marc: I don't want to auto authorize you pulling money out. Be like we'd have to say no, no, no not until you sign the completion document you're totally happy Don't worry it'd be the same thing. We would never it I'd have to think about how we youe know have a whole team pass that through so that we don't fuck up and yeah.
Colton O'Farrell: It could work and mark in that time just to confirm that was Monday that was at noon your time 2 of your time. Sorry about that.
Marc: Yeah, I got 2 p.m Monday the 28th speaking with Colton.
Colton O'Farrell: Just sent it right now. So you should be getting that.
Marc: Awesome. Alright, well that's good for now. If I'm in and this is outside of limits being changed, I should start playing this. I will do my homework and play with this such that I have better questions that are more specific to the program and my workflow and process on that next call that might help. I'd love to establish value. The numbers are right at 3% and at 420 a year, it's slightly better value, plus it's a nice platform. So I do want to find a way to use this.
Colton O'Farrell: Awesome. Well, I'm going to also send you some resources too. So I have a pre-recorded demo if you want to share it with some of the team. Okay. So it's a walkthrough of most of the workflows that we showed. It'll show you how to connect to QuickBooks online as well. I'll link our security pricing, also our G2 customer reviews too. So you'll have all that. But we got time on Monday to. Reconnect,
Marc: see how it's going with you playing around with it. And don't worry, we'll get you set up with that. Here's one last final question that takes a second. Is there almost like one of those UPC codes that my installers could, let's say, show someone that their phone hits it and then it pays us?
Ivan LaBianca: Is that sort of like a QR code or something?
Marc: Yeah, a QR I meant. Almost like they do in Venmo and this and that where like, Hey, you owe us 5,000. Just hit this and that way they don't touch their phone. They're just giving them information via that QR code, and that's how they get it.
Colton O'Farrell: Something like that?
Ivan LaBianca: They could get the link. They'd need to enter in the, just the account number and routing number, which is actually on their side.
Marc: On their side. On their side.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah.
Ivan LaBianca: But they could, you could just use that portal. That'd be the easiest way to do it. And you could have the link as a QR code to that on paper or whatever, you know, on the, on a sticker, and just like, yep, here.
Marc: You can pay us digitally. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. that's right, because you can stickerize a URL to a QR. Okay, that's interesting. That might be a way I can see it happening with the immediacy, but them not touching their phone. There's these little things I want done, but things I think we can't cross certain borders. So that might accomplish it. All right, guys, I'm good. I'm happy. I'm kind of semi-stoked. I'm gonna play with this, but see.
Colton O'Farrell: You next Monday at 2. See you next Monday at 2. Thanks so much for the time, guys. Have a good one. Good job. Bye. Thank you.
