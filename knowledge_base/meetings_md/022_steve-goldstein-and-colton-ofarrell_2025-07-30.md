Steve Goldstein: . . . . . . . . Hey, Colton, can you hear me?
Colton O'Farrell: Hey, Steve, how's it going today?
Steve Goldstein: Great.
Colton O'Farrell: Awesome. Was wondering if you got a chance to review that demo video I sent.
Steve Goldstein: I did. Awesome. Yeah.
Colton O'Farrell: What were your thoughts with it? Just curious.
Steve Goldstein: It's very much like Bill 360.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, so, you know, when I talked.
Steve Goldstein: With the team, a couple of nicer features, but yeah, all integrated with QuickBooks. The only question I had was when you added a new customer or vendor, you did it on your site versus us doing it in QuickBooks. Yep.
Colton O'Farrell: So if you're on QuickBooks Online, which I remember you mentioned you were, when you're connected with Nickel, we just automatically bring all of your customers, everything over in Nickel. Awesome.
Steve Goldstein: Yeah.
Colton O'Farrell: So like I mentioned, everything would be just brought over, so you wouldn't have to worry about that. Were there other questions you had or things that I could show you in the platform just to kind of maybe see if there's workarounds for kind of what you're dealing with?
Steve Goldstein: No, I'm all set. Wow, I turned my blur off.
Colton O'Farrell: What are you looking to turn off?
Steve Goldstein: Blur background, there you go.
Colton O'Farrell: Oh, I gotcha. No worries. Yeah, so I was wondering, did you think that Nickel maybe was gonna Kind of help with the solution you're looking for otherwise, I did mention your company.
Steve Goldstein: It's up to you to let me know about the reminder that that that's the whole key to this is that we have taken our customers and divided them into two groups. One is due upon receipt and the other is due in 30 days. And we did this because 80% of my volume is coming from one customer. And again, that's 34 locations in 28 states. That's Bluegreen Resorts, a timeshare company. They were bought out by Hilton Grand Vacations. And in the last 30, 45 days, I've added three Hilton locations. Now, before that, Bluegreen paid me from corporate 30 days by clockwork. Hilton, as of April 1st, took over the payments and they pay by purchase order and they pay 30 days from when they get the purchase order requisition. The transition for my customers was a learning curve. So I went from 30 days up to over 60 because they weren't getting the paperwork in to Hilton to pay me. Right. I'm getting better now. We're between 30 and 40 days, but we set up this whole reminder system so that we could get paid. We now put on our invoices my Hilton vendor number and my ID so that they know, we tell them to please submit it so we can get paid. But the reminders are.
Colton O'Farrell: Could you show me an example of that reminder letter? Could I see if you have it on your computer or just on paper as well?
Steve Goldstein: I do. Wow.
Colton O'Farrell: Because I'm wondering, we had another customer that they had a specific business model where they had to include some terms of service for kind of like a live product that once they had indicated that it was on their customer side, like they would be responsible for it and wouldn't want any kind of like chargebacks. And I know that's we basically built it into the invoice that they sent. So I'm wondering if we could potentially do something with this reminder letter. In kind of the same fashion, but I would have to see it and understand a little bit more about it to be able to advise on that.
Steve Goldstein: Okay, so the first one, which goes on all of our invoices says, please submit this invoice to Hilton Graham Vacations for a purchase order so Print Alliance can get paid. Thank you, Alliance.
Colton O'Farrell: Are you able to share your screen and show the results?
Steve Goldstein: Oh, yeah.
Colton O'Farrell: There's a green share button at the bottom.
Steve Goldstein: Okay.
Colton O'Farrell: Awesome. Okay, I see your screen. Is it just this portion at the top or is there anything below that?
Steve Goldstein: This is on every invoice. And then we have the follow-up letters, which I'm going to try to get right now. Okay, so these are the reminders.
Colton O'Farrell: So I just see the same invoice, so you might want to close this one out or move the other reminders to this screen.
Steve Goldstein: Okay, can you see the second screen?
Colton O'Farrell: I can't yet. I think you stopped sharing when you close out of that last tab. So if you just want to hit the green button again at the bottom and reshare your screen.
Steve Goldstein: Can you see the reminder letters?
Colton O'Farrell: I can, yes, this is perfect.
Steve Goldstein: Thank you. The first one says to facilitate smooth payment to Print Alliance, we kindly request that you make sure that you submitted this invoice to Hilton Grand Vacations for a purchase order for our payment. Thank you for double checking. We appreciate your business. Thanks to the team at Print Alliance and again, our supplier number and our ID number. And then reminder two, that one goes out in seven days. Reminder two goes out in 30 days. Please help us check on our payment of this 30 day old invoice from Print Alliance. If you could kindly check with Hilton Grand Vacations to see if a check has been issued. We appreciate you and your business and your help. Thank you, the team at Kern Alliance. And then three and 40 days informs them that it's past due and could they check on it.
Colton O'Farrell: So this is being sent via a paper or email or a paper mail or is it an email being sent?
Steve Goldstein: Email.
Colton O'Farrell: Email.
Steve Goldstein: And then separating our accounts, everybody that is due upon receipt, in five days we send them a reminder to pay us, and in 10 days we tell them that it's past due.
Colton O'Farrell: I got it. Okay, cool. Is there anything else that you're sending or is this kind of the what you showed previously and then this everything?
Steve Goldstein: Yeah. What I showed previously We put that on our invoices with our logo and all that stuff. I'm positive that we can build the invoice that way. But as a reminder, it would be extremely useful for my cash flow. So I would switch companies if you could be able to help me with this kind of follow up. So I'm sure you're gonna have to check with people. I can actually send you this file.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, if you could, that'd be awesome.
Steve Goldstein: Sure.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, you know, this after I've had a chance to actually kind of see it and see what you're doing, I do have some ideas that we may be able to support this. I don't want to promise anything like I said, until I talk with, Yeah, the engineering team and just see. But I know we've done something similar like this for another customer and it's worked well for them. I just gotta double check. It's obviously very different business model. But yeah, no, I'm happy to check on this.
Steve Goldstein: Some have better departments that can write the code to get it done and some say, no, we just can't get this done. But if you can, I'm willing to consider moving over to your company.
Colton O'Farrell: So, yeah, and I was curious with the average amount for these invoices. So you mentioned, you know, 80% of this is coming from the Hilton and 34 states. What are those.
Steve Goldstein: Again? So, this is a printout and. For. Example, in the last. What's this? This is 0 to 60, 61, 31 to 60.
Colton O'Farrell: So.
Steve Goldstein: I'm going to say that there's 1, 2, 3, 4-5-6-7-8-9-10-11 that are between 1 and $3,300 and the rest are under a thousand and how many do we have total? 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10-11-12-13-14-15-16-17-18-19-20-21-22-23-24-25-26-27-28-29-30 But he wants to group them together. So 10% are between 1 and 3,000, 25%. There are 40 invoices, and this is accounts receivable. So there's probably more, but 75% or 30 of them would be under $1,000. And those range from, I'm just gonna just read them. 400-124-189-216-422-181-110-210-185-236-233-395-575. that could be a good idea.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, yeah, no, that's perfect. That's exactly what I was looking, looking for. Cool. I got a yearly volume.
Steve Goldstein: The yearly volume I told you.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, it was like 310 last year, right? Was the annual revenue.
Steve Goldstein: 3 16. Yeah. And then 320 the year before. So. Right. I'm not really taking on new customers only by referral. Right.
Colton O'Farrell: Because, you know, the primary business is with the one partner.
Steve Goldstein: So. Well, because also, I'm 75 years old. I've been a printer over 50 years. I've got this great brokerage with this, you know. Most of the manufacturing of these products are done by somebody else and either I ship them or they ship them in my name. So I have major contracts and no one can beat the prices that I'm giving them all across. Because trust me, Orlando, Florida would rather buy it in Florida than buy it from me. Right.
Colton O'Farrell: But they can't beat your price.
Steve Goldstein: So they cannot. I go right to the manufacturer. So I'm giving a trade discount plus a volume discount, a double do. And because I'm brokering and I moved into this house two years ago, the whole front of the house is a business with three workstations, a digital press, a hydraulic cutter for the jobs that I do do. And then we live in the back and my wife and I are still working so we can travel. It's just too good to give up.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, sounds like it.
Steve Goldstein: It pays for my car, it pays for my gas, it pays for my cell phone. Right. And I do it with three part-time employees.
Colton O'Farrell: Nice. That's awesome. Well, you know, I'm really hoping we're able to help solve this kind of challenge you have. Like I mentioned, the team, I think, will be able to put something together, but I don't want to promise anything until I get that info from you.
Steve Goldstein: Right.
Colton O'Farrell: But no, it'd be awesome to help solve this for you and then you can focus more on running your business. And it's interesting, we have a model that you guys have. So especially when it comes to ACH processing, there is nobody who can do it for free like we can. It's built because of the relationships we have with our sponsor banks. There's no other company out there that's going to be able to offer that. And that's something that we've seen to be very successful.
Steve Goldstein: And you have the highest Customer satisfaction ratings between your competitors.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, absolutely. And it's because we do things like support customer businesses for free because, you know, even if we're not making money from that customer in general, the referrals, the reviews, the people that we get connected from through them. So when their customers are paying them via Nickel and they're like, Hey, what is this? Oh my gosh, this is awesome. I can pay free ACH, new customer that way. Maybe they're doing, you know, multimillion dollars in business and we've been growing like crazy and seeing a lot of success. So I would love to support your business and offer kind of that same solution to you. If you know it works out well, I'm sure you have many connections that would be more than happy to utilize us and yeah, we'd love to just support your business. So, Steve, I know you're a busy guy. I'm going to give you some time back here in your day. I'm going to go ahead and follow up with our team. get the confirmation I need. I'll be following up with an email today for you.
Steve Goldstein: Okay? Yeah. And both those, I will email you back with attachments. That'd be awesome. Letters. All right. All right.
Colton O'Farrell: Well, thanks so much, Steve. Talk soon. Great to meet you.
Steve Goldstein: Likewise. Bye-bye.
