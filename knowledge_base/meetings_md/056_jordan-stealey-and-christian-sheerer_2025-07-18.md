Zak George: Hey, Christian. What I normally do is I just wait for like three minutes. If he doesn't hop on, I usually just give him a call. But he accepted the invitation, so he's probably should probably show up. Yeah, I agree with both of those things. He didn't mention he didn't, he didn't need to, yeah, I watched the call. It's not for him. It's like he likes looking at it for his clients. Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah.
Zak George: Cool. But what I'm a little concerned about is, because he did mention it, it's okay if I didn't give him a courtesy call, but, yeah, he might not show. I mean, and then it was totally fine. He doesn't really owe us anything. Just give me a call. We'll give them a call in like two minutes. Yep.
