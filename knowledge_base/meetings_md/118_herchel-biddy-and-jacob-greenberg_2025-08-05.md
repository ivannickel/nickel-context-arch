HERCHEL BIDDY: . .
Jacob Greenberg: Hey, Herschel. Hello.
HERCHEL BIDDY: Sorry about that.
Jacob Greenberg: That's all good. How are you doing?
HERCHEL BIDDY: I'm in my Austin, Texas home. about one hour difference from Boston. The problem is that I. I just moved here about. About this home about a month ago, and I'm still trying to get the connections going. I got my connection here, but I have my trigger girl over there, so I have to move things around.
Jacob Greenberg: Anyway, it's set up. All right, new move.
HERCHEL BIDDY: Yeah. My wife was just laughing. I mean, like, oh, yeah, I have something at 5 30. I forgot. Jacob, so let's get to it. Sorry.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, that's for sure. So give me a little bit of background about FIBRE and how you guys found nickel and how we can help.
HERCHEL BIDDY: Yes, actually, I found your company. We're a RTD coffee manufacturing and tea. So think bottle coffees. We work with some brands that are I think, like Nescafe, it's one of them. I think you probably know Nescafe. Tim Hortons, for example, that's another one. So we work with several brands, several companies, small ones, mid-sides and big companies. We started in 2022 and we just rebranded and branching out into national bottle. And. Domestic products that are bottling or coffee, whichever packaging you want, we can definitely make it happen. So very vertical, very versatile company. And we're doing pretty good right now. We're almost about 2 million yearly profits. So here's the thing. We've been dealing since we started as a small company. We've been dealing with build.com. and we just want to move away from bill.com we had some people pitch out to polity we had some other other ones pitch out different a different company but it's not perfect for us I think so we're looking for our our ap payables our compables to move away from bill.com and that's something that I just said well let me see what if I can find something that we can move into that is reliable. So I came to getnickel.com, it was just sponsored in one of the things that I was reading and I was like, I guess metadata just gets involved so much into your cache and cookies. You guys just have to Google just have the perfect pitch for for this. I decided to go on your website. I know that you guys do. You. Basically give companies runway of time to, for your receivables and your payables. I guess you guys both ways, I'm guessing. I know a lot of companies, for example, might actually give you a credit line and, and, and, you know, not sure how you guys do it, but most companies will give you a credit line and, and that would be one of like a loan per se, a business loan. And they, you know, work with credit facilities and they will basically like upfront you cash depending on how much for how much time you needed. Yeah, we've had a lot of companies pitch to us this day. So, but I guess you guys a little different because you guys give net terms. So.
Jacob Greenberg: Well, so how about this Herschel? Tell me exactly what it is that you guys are looking for. You're looking for a better accounts receivable and accounts payable process.
HERCHEL BIDDY: Yeah, we're looking to have a better system for accounts payables. But you guys do both. You guys do accounts receivable and now payables. Now again, we have just a, you know, a wallet of clients. Some clients won't fit into GetNickel. So those clients have are basically managed by an account management.
Jacob Greenberg: So you're talking about bigger clients.
HERCHEL BIDDY: Bigger clients, yeah. But there's the mid and small clients that we have. that, you know, simply we don't have any methods to extend credit line to them. And I just one of those things like, okay, well, this makes a lot of sense to me because I, you know, we, if we provide a net term for these clients, that would be an excellent, you know, optional instead of us, you know, basically fronting the days. that we have to wait to get paid. Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: So what are you currently using for your AP and AR?
HERCHEL BIDDY: So accounts payable, we're doing Bill. Only bill.com and we're using Melio payments. And I think Payables is using, I should have brought Eric because he wouldn't know. Eric is a manager for the AP, but he basically, we have a H-A-S, ACH system, we have Melio, we don't use it, as I've been told my last minute, and we have bill.com for payables. Receivables, we do most of our receivables in Excel. We don't have a system for receivables. We just have our own system that we developed that you basically, you know, we're able to you know, work with our accounting and our finance team, basically, you know, move things forward. It's actually work, but we want to migrate to a system that works. So it works, everything's embedded.
Jacob Greenberg: Got it.
HERCHEL BIDDY: That makes sense. Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: So you kind of have a disparate AR system and you were using build.com and you want to transition away from it.
HERCHEL BIDDY: Yeah, yeah. Build.com is probably the biggest, the only system we use that actually we use that. We squeeze a lot of money off it for the subscriptions that we pay for. And, I mean, we get charged for ACH and all that, but other companies are in the network, so.
Jacob Greenberg: How much are you getting charged for ACH at Bill? And what are your costs?
HERCHEL BIDDY: Well, in cases where we have to do second day, because we somehow did not pay in a client, we will have to do it two day. they'll charge us 12 dollars for that. And we can send out over, you know, we also have the same day. That's a little more expensive. And then regular ACH takes almost 10 days, sometimes seven, five days I'm being told. And those payments will go out, you know, and it, it will be basically scheduled so they could go out and so forth and so forth.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, so you have a very, very long turnaround time for.
HERCHEL BIDDY: Yes. Yes. That's great. Well, this is, this is typical with Bill.
Jacob Greenberg: Are you also getting charged like a percentage on the age?
HERCHEL BIDDY: No, we're not getting charged any percentage because you're only doing ACH and we're doing our own net terms. So.
Jacob Greenberg: So you're doing about 12 per transaction. How many transactions are you guys doing in a month?
HERCHEL BIDDY: Those are. They call them fast payments, fast ACH. And I'm going to say about 25% of those are fast ACH because, I mean, sometimes you just need to pay it. And I'm going to say about maybe 1% of those the same day. So, yeah, we're getting charged a substantial amount of fees. And then the subscription is not much of a bigger difference as competitors, I might say. But as far as fees, we're getting charged hundreds, probably thousands of dollars. I don't have the numbers. I wanted Eric to come in here and actually tell us the numbers. But think about a lot of money being exited out of our company from fees. Because we don't want to wait seven days per se.
Jacob Greenberg: Can you tell me the average size of your transactions and how many of them you're typically doing?
HERCHEL BIDDY: In a given yeah average size is 5 000. That's standard one day transaction is 5 000. I'm gonna say lower than that, but just the average. Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: And how many transactions are you guys doing weekly?
HERCHEL BIDDY: Weekly we're doing about just an overall, I think I'm gonna say about 150. I've seen 150 in the Excel sheet. in transactions. And, and yearly we're doing about 250, 000 in payables to vendors.
Jacob Greenberg: So.
HERCHEL BIDDY: Does that make sense? Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: So let me get these numbers down really quick.
HERCHEL BIDDY: Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: So in a given month, you might have about 600 unique transactions. about a quarter of those transactions are at $12 cost.
HERCHEL BIDDY: Yes.
Jacob Greenberg: Paying around $1,800 a month just for the $12 transaction.
HERCHEL BIDDY: Yeah, yeah, basically. Because if you miss a transaction with a vendor, you're on their bad side, basically. And you risk delaying a lot of shipments when that happens. Because, I mean, Not sure if you pay early, as far as I know, most companies will ship out the product to you. We don't have troubles with shipping. So we're scared about, you know, having to not receive a certain product that we need for a certain client. And so we work with this other companies who also do coffee. So just think about this. You can't schedule something 10 days. see if you don't get it or not. So we'll use the expedited system and that's what they make money of. They make money off clients like I think every client is using a $12 system. Right.
Jacob Greenberg: Because, you know, I have good news and I have other news for you and I want to, okay. So the good news is that we're going to be able to save you like seven days per the transactions you guys are doing. So they're settling faster.
HERCHEL BIDDY: Okay, awesome.
Jacob Greenberg: One to two day turnaround. We're also going to be saving you guys at the very least based on just that 12 dollar transaction and no other costs incurred from the long settlement times or from any other processing rates. We're going to save you at least 21, 000 a year by switching nickel. And we can absolutely do that for you. And it's easy to get going.
HERCHEL BIDDY: And I knew, I knew it will be saving. I, I had, I had an idea that we would be I mean, that's the good news.
Jacob Greenberg: I have other news. The other news is that we currently don't have trade credit as a product that we're offering to the general public. We have it for a select few in beta right now for specific customers that have been using our solution for a couple months already. So that they have approved records of their transactions, they're reliable customers that we could verify on our own network. So as of right now, we wouldn't be able to extend a trade credit or net term solution for you guys, but if that's all right for now and you're willing to let us earn your business and grow with you, save you $20,000 a year, I'll hop into the demo and I'll show you how it works. Does that sound okay with you?
HERCHEL BIDDY: Yeah, that sounds great, man. Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: So let me open this up. Give me one second here.
HERCHEL BIDDY: All right.
Jacob Greenberg: So you haven't created an account yet, right? You're just, no, no. Okay.
HERCHEL BIDDY: First day, just kind of, you know, schedule something for me. Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: All right. Oh, wrong screen. Hold on, don't look at me. wrong screen again. Don't look at me.
HERCHEL BIDDY: I'm not even. I think I've. I'm not even looking at anything because it's not even showing.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, hold on.
HERCHEL BIDDY: Give me one second. Your. Your data is safe for me.
Jacob Greenberg: I had too many screens open. It was just my notes on.
HERCHEL BIDDY: I'm an. I'm in the outside of my home, and I can't get really good service, so I think I'm lagging a bit. yeah, you.
Jacob Greenberg: You do look a little choppy on my end, so if you want me to slow down for any reason, please.
HERCHEL BIDDY: No, no, no, no. You look great. I think myself, when I look at my screen, it's choppy.
Jacob Greenberg: Awesome. You're the first person to tell me I look great today.
HERCHEL BIDDY: No, no problem, dude. I grew up in Boston. No worries about it.
Jacob Greenberg: All right, let's go. All right, so we got. This is a summary page, so. as a quick recap before we really get into it, Nickel was initially built for the built world. So what that means is we are backed by Black & Decker and by DeWalt, and our founder comes from Black & Decker. So initially what we did is we saw that inside the construction agency or construction industry and manufacturers and distributors of built goods, There was discombobulated accounts payable and accounts receivable processes. People are paying via check, via credit card, via ACH, and it's just all over the place. And it was taking a lot of time to reconcile with their accounting system, and they were losing a lot of money in fees, and they didn't really have a good cash flow management process. So that's where we came in. We very quickly learned that the solution we developed was applicable to way more businesses because we started getting requests for demos. Companies like yours and a whole gamut of industries. People that just wanted to have a better cash flow advantage. So that's what we're doing. We're improving cash flow advantage, enabling credit card payments to be as cost effective and flexible as ACH payments with quick turnaround times as well. So essentially we help our customers give their customers the entire suite of choices for their own payment method and limiting the amount of cost that's gonna be on our customers. So we offer free ACH, unlimited free ACH. We can handle transactions of any size, and we sync directly with accounting systems. So can you tell me real quick before I get too ahead of myself, what is like the largest transaction you guys might have on a single transaction and what accounting system are you using?
HERCHEL BIDDY: Yeah. Our biggest transaction would be. A company. I think it was about 42,000 that I saw. It's just like one transaction, 42,000. This was a company that provides almost 40% of our basically additives and just products that we need to make sure that we get our clients products out the door. Okay. We're using QuickBooks and I think we're migrating to a new system. I think it's NetSuite, I think. I'm my store. Yeah, we're still talking about that.
Jacob Greenberg: Great. So for now, once you create your account in Nickel, which you can do today on the free plan, what I would do is I'd recommend you upgrading to Nickel Plus. It's $35 a month, but you have unlimited transactions of any size. So you can have unlimited free transactions on Nickel, Core, but the lart, the transaction limit per transaction is $25,000. So for $35 a month, you can do transactions of $2 million if you want to.
HERCHEL BIDDY: Okay, but if I want to play and say I want to pay somebody, I will have to basically use my other system because obviously it would be too large of a transaction to happen. No, again, we don't have transactions, I think, of 30, $25,000, but we might have something lower than that. Yeah, well, over that. yeah, I have to use my system. Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: No, you can use our system.
HERCHEL BIDDY: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, you can. So we. I'm just talking about pricing plans real quick.
HERCHEL BIDDY: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: Just to let you know, you can sign up for free. It's zero dollars a month. You have unlimited free ACH, but there's a limit of twenty five thousand dollars per transaction.
HERCHEL BIDDY: Okay. I see.
Jacob Greenberg: For 35 a month you get nickel plus and nickel plus has no transaction limit.
HERCHEL BIDDY: Oh, okay. I understand now.
Jacob Greenberg: So if you want to do, if you see yourself using a platform where you're going to be sending and accepting payments of 25 000 or up, you're going to want to do the 35 a month plan. Okay.
HERCHEL BIDDY: And quick question because you, you showed me this. Two business, they turned around. I did see these and, and I've, I saw the other ones, three business, they throw turnaround, which is. When I see that often, it's how basically our former or current bill.com pitched it to us because it was, you know, it's, it's, but it would take longer because we're talking about business days. So say I schedule something for today, when would my vendor receive its payment?
Jacob Greenberg: So currently the only caveat to the two-day business turnaround that we have is we have payment processing cutoff times at 4:00 PM right now. So if it is 5:00 PM where you are or 4:49 where you are, this will start to get processed tomorrow and the two-day countdown timer will start tomorrow instead of today. Herschel, are you still there? Herschel.
HERCHEL BIDDY: Okay. .
