Jim Lisi: Hey, I am here. Cool.
Christian Sheerer: I see Marty's getting on as well. Marty, I think we can hear you already if you didn't seem to be muted. Maybe not, though. Maybe. Got a audio thing you gotta hit.
Jim Lisi: Yeah. Now it's off. Now you're back. But no video, but no description either, so something's not connecting. Right.
Christian Sheerer: Want to try? Marty leaving and rejoining. Let me fix. Marty, if you can hear me, I'm gonna. I'm gonna remove you real quick because I think that might fix it and just hop back into the same link. Oh, she did it.
Jim Lisi: Cool. Hello, Marty.
Participant 1: Hi. Hi. Do you see my name up there?
Jim Lisi: See where we're at? No, you're not there now.
Participant 1: Well, I see you in my. In my. My computer. I see you and I see Christian.
Christian Sheerer: See your name, but not. We can't see you. And I don't think we're hearing you from the thing.
Jim Lisi: But that's okay, I guess, right?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. If we have. If we have your voice. Yeah, no, that's totally fine. If we have your voice on this phone, we're. We're good. It's all real time.
Participant 1: Okay. I'm gonna click you off because I'm hearing double. Not you. Not you, Jim.
Jim Lisi: Right. You will. Unless Marty is. Your voice isn't coming through on Zoom. So I don't know what's.
Participant 1: Yeah.
Jim Lisi: What's up with your computer? Maybe you don't have a monitor or you don't have a microphone or. I have no idea. Really.
Participant 1: I have a Mac.
Jim Lisi: A Mac. Okay.
Participant 1: And. And like I said, I'm a computer idiot.
Jim Lisi: That's all. Right. I just don't know how to help you that I don't.
Participant 1: Yeah, it's irritating for me to hear my voice twice. I'm gonna click you up n. Okay. Can you hear me?
Jim Lisi: I can hear you. Yeah.
Participant 1: Fine. I can hear you now. Okay, Go ahead. Okay.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. No, So I know the goal of today was to sort of. Now that we got everything set up and Marty was in it, we wanted to kind of run some transaction or kind of go through the process of setting up a transaction.
Jim Lisi: Yeah. Marty was going to link QuickBooks, when I recall. And then we just needed to do invoices and those kind of things.
Participant 1: That was the problem when I went into my QuickBooks. I'm online now. I'm not on the, you know, the regular I. For years. I mean, I'm talking, you know, 10 years I've been on the. Just the regular. And this year I went online anyway, so it's really screwing Me up. So I tried. What, Kristen, you told me to go into the account settings and to integrate. I went into the account settings and I couldn't Find integration link. QuickBooks account. I couldn't find that.
Christian Sheerer: Oh, okay. Weird, because it should be. You can't see me, can you?
Participant 1: No, I can't see you.
Christian Sheerer: It should be right there under integrations.
Participant 1: Okay, I'm gonna go QuickBooks. Log into Rotary Club, Santa Barbara North. Okay.
Christian Sheerer: Oh, no, you have to. To start the integration, you have to. You have to go to Nickel to link your QuickBooks account.
Participant 1: Oh, okay. So how do I go. So I go to Nichols.
Christian Sheerer: Yep.
Participant 1: Where do I go then?
Christian Sheerer: Go to account settings in Nickel on the bottom.
Jim Lisi: She doesn't know the address, I guess for nickel.
Participant 1: No, I've been getting. I did get this morning. Something from fool or some person from your office. But hold on. So I go into the. The Safari.
Jim Lisi: If that's your browser.
Participant 1: Yeah, that's my browser. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Okay, go into my browser and what do I do here? Open location. What's your location? Hello?
Jim Lisi: I don't know what you're asking. Open location.
Participant 1: Well, how do I get your nickels?

Jim Lisi: It's.
Christian Sheerer: Get nickel.com.

Jim Lisi: But let me go in and under account settings, get paid members. Yeah, she's on here.
Participant 1: So do I put my. My email?
Jim Lisi: It would be Marty gilgarcia-aia.com. that's how you were invited.
Participant 1: Okay. What about a pastor? Do I have to set it up?
Jim Lisi: Well, there should have been. You should have received an invitation and then to that email address. And then you would be, you know, led through the steps. But I don't know what to do now.
Participant 1: Receive an invitation.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. Did you get an email from.
Jim Lisi: It's.
Christian Sheerer: It may have said, like Jim invited you or Rotary at. Somebody at Rotary. SB Invited you to Nickel in your email to that. To that email.
Participant 1: I go to the email, Jeff, you.
Jim Lisi: Should look at it. You might want to check Your spam.
Participant 1: You know, guys, I don't even know how to do that. You're talking to an idiot.
Jim Lisi: Relax.
Christian Sheerer: Not at all. It's all good.
Participant 1: I'm getting very. I'm getting very frustrated because I. I just don't. No, I didn't. I did not get an email, and I don't even know how to get into spam. Table. Okay, here's Jim. Jim Trivia night notes. When. When did you pay? Oh, payment link.
Jim Lisi: Yeah, payment link might be it. I'm not sure.
Participant 1: Hi, Christian. Hope you had a nice weekend. For tomorrow's meeting, I want to let you know would be there. No.
Christian Sheerer: It should have been before that, probably because I think. I think Jim invited you on our last conversation last week.
Participant 1: Please add the Gil Gmail ads to our meeting now that.
Christian Sheerer: If you. There's another fix to this where if you go and. And you hit request password change on nickel.
Participant 1: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: You can do that as well. And then you can set up whatever password you think is good for you. If you want to share it, by all means.
Participant 1: Is that what you're suggesting?
Christian Sheerer: Oh, just. Yeah. I would make whatever suggestions easiest for you in terms of password management. I don't want to suggest that you guys share passwords, but.
Jim Lisi: No, no. Yeah, I think. I think we did set the password up. You asked what the password we wanted and you did use the same password.
Participant 1: Yeah. Wait a minute. Let me see my notes. Log in. Oh, I have it. Wait a minute. I have it.
Christian Sheerer: Nice.
Participant 1: Was. Sorry.
Jim Lisi: All right.
Participant 1: Now I gotta get back in nickel. Yeah.
Jim Lisi: Yeah. What? You might want to bookmark that page.
Participant 1: I wouldn't know how to do that.
Jim Lisi: Well, I can tell you how to do it in a Mac, so.
Participant 1: Okay, now I'm in. Login Marley password. No email and password comb combination found. Maybe it was under. Should I put your email in?
Jim Lisi: No, we don't want you to use my email. I'm in too, so I don't know if that would work.
Christian Sheerer: Maybe if you try forgot password. If there's a prompt there that says forgot password or reset.
Participant 1: Yeah, it says forgot password. So send. Reset link. Okay. I'm sorry to waste your time.
Christian Sheerer: Not a waste. This is that we set aside this time. So it's all good.
Participant 1: Okay, here's reset password. Reset password. I'm on my phone resetting my password. This is a password invention set that has been set. It has been set. Enter your new password. So I'm going to enter a new password. Okay. Go to my account. Wants me to do. All right, let me do it. Wants me to go to fill password error that user already has an account on. Can you hear me?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, yeah. It's saying that you already have an account. Yeah, that's.
Participant 1: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: And even when you hit reset password.
Participant 1: Yeah.
Jim Lisi: Well, the password should be capital R for rotary exclamation port 959. That's what we set up. If my memory serves. I didn't write it down.
Participant 1: Oh, it's fine.
Jim Lisi: Create.
Participant 1: Oh, but it's. Now it's saying create experience. Creating an account. Of course it's going to say that user already has an account. How do I go back to sign in? Okay, I'm gonna get out of here.
Jim Lisi: Can I invite her again?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. Did you. Did you take her out?
Jim Lisi: No, no, she's in. But I could delete her and invite her again.
Christian Sheerer: No, if she's saying that she's going to try with that password to sign in or the one that she just reset. Let's try that first before trying to reinvigor.
Participant 1: Okay. Your password. Okay, I'll come back.
Jim Lisi: That sounds promising.
Participant 1: There's no email Again, I reset the password.
Christian Sheerer: It says that your email is not there.

Christian Sheerer: You're still not in.
Participant 1: Sorry, what was that?
Christian Sheerer: You're still not in.
Participant 1: No, I'm still not in. It just says no email and password combination found. So it's not.
Christian Sheerer: Because I can. I can remotely get into your account and so Marty gilgarcia-aia.com looks like I can get into it.
Participant 1: Okay.
Jim Lisi: Can you delete the password?
Christian Sheerer: I can update. Do you want to give me a path? I can update the password for you and I think that might be able to fix it.

Christian Sheerer: Okay. Okay. I save that as your password. I'm going to log out of your account and try. Try that one again with Marty Gilgarcia A. AIA.
Jim Lisi: You want me to log out too?
Christian Sheerer: I don't think you.
Jim Lisi: It.
Christian Sheerer: It would. I don't know. Not necessarily, but maybe if you want to.
Participant 1: You reset my cancer.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah.
Participant 1: So. Okay. So do you want to update the password saved for Marty? Okay. Yeah, it's getting in now. Update password. Yes. Okay, I'm in.
Christian Sheerer: You're in. Nice.
Participant 1: Okay, you did it. So now.
Jim Lisi: Now we want to integrate QuickBooks.
Christian Sheerer: So now. Yeah, you want to go to Account Settings in the bottom left.
Participant 1: And then.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, once you're in account Settings, you should see a bunch of stuff. And then you'll go into integrations. On the top right.
Participant 1: Where it says company. Basic information about your company, please contact me.
Jim Lisi: Above that.
Participant 1: Oh, even above the general.
Jim Lisi: There you go.
Christian Sheerer: General.
Participant 1: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: Yep.
Participant 1: Okay, I'm gonna click that.
Jim Lisi: Far right. Go to the far right.
Christian Sheerer: Yep, yep. She's there. She's. Yeah. It says sync your nickel account with QuickBooks, and then you should be able to click link QuickBooks account.
Participant 1: Sure. Okay. Good luck. Get into it. Let's get you into QuickBooks. Use a different needs or idea. This is. Oh, password. Thank God. Okay, connect step one of two. Connecting nickel to center. What is this? Center for Successful Aging. No, that's. That's another thing that was on my account that I can't get rid of. Show details about data.
Jim Lisi: I used to have access to our club account. You want me to try to do this? I don't know.
Participant 1: What happened is that I put Rotary Club into my QuickBooks and I have several accounts, you know, our personal Garcia Architects and.
Jim Lisi: Yeah, I wouldn't see your accounts. I've got multiple accounts also.
Participant 1: But you're. Do you have.
Jim Lisi: Huh.
Participant 1: Okay. Well, then. Well, you know how that works then. But is your clip. You know, it's been screwing up since I put it on online.
Jim Lisi: I haven't looked at it in ages. And I don't know if my. My credentials are good anymore or what, but it.
Participant 1: Oh, I know my credentials are good, but. But it keeps. It's sending me to the wrong account. So what I'm going to have to do is I'm going to have to call QuickBooks and find out why it's doing that. And I don't even have that account. I was gonna. I was going to help this. This one company out and they decided to pay a bookkeeper.
Jim Lisi: No.
Christian Sheerer: Okay.
Participant 1: But. And. But it. But it was still. It's still. I didn't know how to get rid of it. I guess I could steal money from them. I'm just kidding.
Jim Lisi: Yeah.
Participant 1: Huh. Okay, Link. I don't know how I Don't know how to get.
Christian Sheerer: To the rotary one?
Participant 1: Yeah, to the rotary one.
Christian Sheerer: Are you on your phone?
Participant 1: No, I'm on. I'm on my lap on my laptop big screen.
Christian Sheerer: And it's the same login for the rotary one as it is for this one that it's prompting you to use now.
Participant 1: Well, it. Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: Okay.
Participant 1: All of all stuff I have. There's about. I have five accounts in there, six accounts, and they all are the same login. But I don't know why. Go to center for Successful Aging?
Christian Sheerer: No. Yeah, I think I'd be able to help you if I could see it, but I just don't know what it's showing you right now.
Participant 1: You can't share my. You don't know how to share a computer or.
Christian Sheerer: Well, I do have to be on the zoom. Yeah.
Participant 1: See? Yeah. Well, there we go. Well, I guess I just need to call. I need to call them direct and get them straightened out.
Christian Sheerer: But it just might be that you have to click down. Maybe there's like a click down outside of the center for the other one, Successful Aging, and there might be able to click into the rotary one instead of that. But I. I don't know. I'm not as familiar with the QuickBooks interface.
Participant 1: Yeah, I just clicked in details about data, and it says about your customer, vendor, and any update you make, you quick looks on my data after you connect. Thanks. I. You know, and I don't want to connect because what if they connect me to that and then they're gonna say, what is this? Anyway, I'm just gonna have to. I'm gonna have to call them direct. You guys still there?
Jim Lisi: Yeah, I'm still here.
Christian Sheerer: Yep. Yep.
Participant 1: Well, so did you. Jim, did you set us up with the bank or.
Jim Lisi: The bank. Yeah, that's that. So that's no problem. I can get into our club, by the way. So if you want me to link this, I can.
Participant 1: I'm sorry, say again?
Jim Lisi: I can get into our. Our QuickBooks. I'm in Rotary Club, Santa Barbara north, right now for QuickBooks.
Participant 1: That was when Tim had the cookbooks.
Jim Lisi: Oh, so this is different.
Participant 1: Yeah. Yeah, it is. Because he had. He had. He didn't have. No, I guess he had. I don't know what he had tell you, too. But he's. When I asked him to do something, he said no, I. I took that off my computer.
Jim Lisi: Okay. All right. Should I. Yeah. Whatever I've got then isn't the right account. So.
Participant 1: Wait a minute here. I'm clicking Rotary Santa Barb North. Settings. Let me go over to Integr. Maybe this is it. Maybe Integration. Quick. Look. No, it keeps coming up. Center. How did you get. How did you get that?
Jim Lisi: I just logged into my, you know, my QuickBooks, and. And that account is still there, so.
Participant 1: No, I know, but that's. That was his.
Jim Lisi: I understand. So I'm just forgetting it now, which is no reason for me. It's not the right account, so that's no help. We've got a new account, so, yeah, unfortunately, I can't help.
Participant 1: Well, anyway, once I get this connect, once I. I call QuickBooks, and, you know, sometimes they keep you on the phone for hours, so I can't do it right now. I mean, you don't want to be. You don't want to wait for their assistance?
Jim Lisi: No, and I got a call in nine minutes, so I need to get off soon anyway.
Participant 1: Yeah. What else are we going to do? Christian?
Christian Sheerer: What was that?
Participant 1: Where. Where. Once I can get it integrated, then it's going to link, you know. Link.
Jim Lisi: Yes.
Christian Sheerer: It'll link up all those open invoices, and then you should just be able to send them out as payment requests through Nickel.
Jim Lisi: Okay, so you want. You wanted to learn how to use Nickel, right? And how to. How to do the invoicing, and so we needed the account set up. Linked first to do that.
Participant 1: Yeah.
Jim Lisi: So you can do that without us, hopefully. And.
Participant 1: And then what?
Jim Lisi: And then we'll call again, I guess, and run through how the system works.
Participant 1: That sounds good. You know, I really apologize because I thought when you told me to go into Quick. I have my notes here. It says QuickBooks online account settings. I didn't know it was Nichols Online or.
Christian Sheerer: No, that's totally okay. And I could have been better about communicating it, so it's totally fine, I think. I mean, we have a help center, which has pretty good, you know, breakdowns of what steps to take to send out a first transaction, even after it's been linked on QuickBooks Online. So I can send over the link to our help center.
Participant 1: And.
Christian Sheerer: No, I apologize because I just assumed it would be. I didn't know that there was, like, the multiple different QuickBooks accounts that you had, so I assumed it would be pretty easy to toggle between them, but maybe they've made it a little bit difficult since the switch from desktop to online. And so once that's sorted, I'll send over the. Well, I'll send over the help center before then. And once that's sorted in the integration bit, you can start to send out transactions and we can keep our thread open if you want to drop me an email when you think everything's ready to go, and we can hop on pretty quickly and I can demo that, you know, within 10 minutes. Should be pretty simple. And then you should be good to go. And then, and then we can set up some time, you know, ahead of the, the meeting.
Participant 1: On your, on your setting page, it says settings Help Center. Is that the one you're talking about?
Christian Sheerer: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. You found it.
Participant 1: Okay, so I can always, if I have some more problems, I'll go there.
Christian Sheerer: Okay.
Participant 1: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: Okay. Yeah. And then always feel free to, to reach me on that email thread that we have, all three of us together, and I can help troubleshoot stuff and we can schedule some time that I can show you around sending out that invoice.
Participant 1: Okay, sounds good. Thank you. Thank you. I don't know, I don't know why I, I, I do zooms on my computer all the time, and I don't know why didn't do it with you.
Jim Lisi: Well, the only thing I had was, you know, the link wasn't working.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, that was just a. We had a domain issue that we had to fix really quickly. So this, the domain went down and we fixed it.
Jim Lisi: Okay, cool.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, everything should be set up now and good to go.
Jim Lisi: All right, awesome. Because I've done QR codes and all that stuff, so very good.
Christian Sheerer: Nice.
Jim Lisi: Here we go. Yep, it's working. Okay, thank you.
Participant 1: All right, thank you. Talk to you soon.
Jim Lisi: Yeah, no worries. Bye.
Participant 1: Bye.
