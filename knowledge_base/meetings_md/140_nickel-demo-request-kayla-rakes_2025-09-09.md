Jacob Greenberg: Hey Kayla.
Kayla Rakes: Hey, how are you?
Jacob Greenberg: Good, how are you?
Kayla Rakes: Good, sorry about that. I was reading your email and I wanted to make sure that we were okay.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, good.
Kayla Rakes: So let me give you a little bit of a background. We don't lend money, but we work with people who do seller finance. So they're not lending money, but they're doing like contract for deed.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay.
Kayla Rakes: Things. We are a certified third party payment processor.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay.
Kayla Rakes: So I have a few things, I guess. First, do you can you help us?
Jacob Greenberg: What are you attempting to accomplish would be the question.
Kayla Rakes: So, we need to get, we have an AE in the audio. Transcribe the English words that are spoken. We have an ISO-like structure where there's a buy rate, we can set the pricing for our customers, and then they charge us and you guys bill us. It also needs to have like an FBO account structure with a delayed holding fund, so like holding funds for X amount of days to mitigate the risk of return. So things like early risk returns basically, and then process the debits that way in like an API thing.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, so you're looking for an integration into your software to manage the AE component of everything on behalf of your customers, but inside the portal in the world in which you're providing your client. Gotcha. So this is not the core of what Nickel does. We have occasionally built out not APIs, but AI agentic and webhook systems on behalf of other clients before.
Kayla Rakes: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: There are certain things to be considered when doing so. And typically these are like longer partnerships. They take a little bit of time to implement. We don't really have an out of the box solution if that's something you're looking for. It'd be like your tech team to our tech team. We talk through it, see how we can develop it, and I would have to pitch it to my tech team to make sure that it's going to be worth it for us as well. So just want to give you the heads up there. If you're looking for something completely out of the box, we might not be the best solution for you guys. But depending on the volume you guys do and your use case a little bit more, we might be able to support.
Kayla Rakes: Okay, so we currently process 1.2 million on one mid and we have additional mids that process probably another 500 or so thousand. How long does that process take?
Jacob Greenberg: It really depends on your software build. It could be anywhere from two days to two to three weeks.
Kayla Rakes: Okay. Then is there startup cost, I'm assuming?
Jacob Greenberg: Again, it really depends on what's going to be taken from our side in order to build it out for you guys. Occasionally there might be an implementation cost if we need to build something completely new. If it's similar to something we built for another organization before, then implementation costs might go away. But for more complex builds, we will see an implementation cost and then a cost per AE. So we won't for these, when we do these partnerships, we can offer 100% free AE.
Kayla Rakes: Yeah. Do you have a general rate?
Jacob Greenberg: It depends on volume and the partnership that we have. So these are longer discussions, more custom agreements than what we typically do. What are you guys currently working with? Do you have a third party partner right now? Why are you looking for a new AE? What's the impetus for the evaluation?
Kayla Rakes: Yeah, so we currently have actually we work with two.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay.
Kayla Rakes: One is Qlik by Pay Compass.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay.
Kayla Rakes: Then Nuvve. Okay. And we just need to have more options for our team. Since the buyout of Trek Commerce with Nuvve, customer service and SLA and everything has just yeah, went into the.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, that happens. Yep.
Kayla Rakes: Just jumped off a cliff, basically.
Jacob Greenberg: I'm sorry.
Kayla Rakes: Not being supported and needing some more stuff there. So that's why we're. Where we're at right now. I can give you an idea. So, like I said, we're running, like, 1.2-ish million a month on our mid with pay Compass, and that is, like, 39 cents. Transaction.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay.
Kayla Rakes: And then we have like a monthly account fee. But yeah, I don't know if this is going to work because of the build out and all of that. We're kind of that's ready. But I am going to what I'll do is I'm heading this but obviously you have to get signed off by our CEO. So I will take this back to him and just kind of let him know where we're at. And if he wants to move to the next step, then I'll let you know.
Jacob Greenberg: Sounds good. And what we can do for you in the meantime, which might be helpful for both yourself and that decision process, is if you sent me over a high level, hey, this is what we're trying to accomplish in two sentences and why we're evaluating it. And then the amount that you guys are looking to do. So estimated amount of individual transactions, estimated volume. If you guys are looking to allow people to accept, do you guys currently accept credit cards
Kayla Rakes: or is it only ACH? Yes. So our credit card processing is through PayEngine, which is they're backed by Elavon. So we do do that also. And if you guys have that, we're not opposed to integrating all of it.
Jacob Greenberg: That would definitely be a big motivator for our team as well. Right now, really, Nickel's main revenue stream is from credit card processing. So we enable that. We have affordable rates and we can enable you to pass it on to your customers as well in a compliant way.
Kayla Rakes: What's your current rate?
Jacob Greenberg: 2.9. Okay, so that's what are you guys working with over there?
Kayla Rakes: We also pay 2.9 plus 30 cents and off.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, yeah, we don't have that extra percent fee. And then do you pass that? Are you guys eating those charges right now or are you passing it along? Okay, we could do that for you too.
Kayla Rakes: Do you do AMX?
Jacob Greenberg: Discover all card types, same processing rate.
Kayla Rakes: Because our AMX is 3.4, so that's.
Jacob Greenberg: That'll reduce it a little for you guys.
Kayla Rakes: Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: So, yeah, so I think the best move here so that we can just make sure we're aligned before, I don't want to take too much of your time, if it's not going to be a fit, but if you could send me a quick high level email, kind of your interest, your timeline, And the amount of individual transactions you're looking to do split versus credit card and ACH. I'm going to share that with my team and I'll advocate for you guys to see if we could get something. Maybe we have something that's a little more out of the box based on the bill that you guys have. But just give me the high level overview. I'll talk to them, float it, see if it makes sense to have that second conversation on the technical level. And then we could go from there. Does that sound fair? That sounds great. Okay, awesome. Thank you so much. Of course, Kayla. Have a good rest of your day. Bye. Bye.
