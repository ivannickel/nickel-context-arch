Marc: .
Colton O'Farrell: I shot him a email a couple hours before, so we shall see if he did not reply to it, but he did specify this time was the one that he wanted.
Marc: I sent this.
Ivan LaBianca: Hopefully he shows. He's a little late last time. He'd be like a busy guy. If you have to just give him a call, but I think the biggest thing is what's it going to take for him to activate?
Colton O'Farrell: If he hasn't activated, he talked about wanting to extend. He hasn't linked his bank account yet either.
Marc: Yeah. I think he wanted to, oh, there he is. Hey, Marc.
Colton O'Farrell: What's up, guys?
Marc: Hey, Marc. Going well? How about yourself? How was your weekend, Marc? It was good.
Colton O'Farrell: A little too many beers yesterday, but I'm okay.
Marc: Nice.
Colton O'Farrell: Awesome. Yeah, I had a great weekend as well. It was pretty rainy in Chicago, so mostly just stayed indoors. quite have like the California sun, a.
Marc: Little jealous of that.
Colton O'Farrell: But hopefully this week's a little bit nicer and can actually get out, enjoy some time at the lake. But yeah, it was great for me.
Marc: Right on, right on.
Ivan LaBianca: Where are you based?
Marc: Either you've been to San Francisco.
Ivan LaBianca: I'm actually currently in Oakland. That's why.
Marc: Oh, I'm in San Mateo. I mean, we're based in South City, San Francisco. But I'm in my home in San Mateo. Just So yeah, right fairly close to the airport.
Ivan LaBianca: Nice. Yeah, I'm pretty close to the Oakland airport at the moment. I lived here for a little while and I'm stopping through. I still have a car and a storage locker here.
Marc: So. Gotcha. Funny.
Ivan LaBianca: Okay, cool.
Marc: Let me get on Nickel. I definitely played with it trying to do some homework and it seems pretty simple. Yeah, absolutely. And again, I I had created a link, but it's Nickel payments?
Ivan LaBianca: No, it's just Get Nickel.
Marc: Get Nickel, that's it.
Ivan LaBianca: App.GetNickel or you can go to Get Nickel and hit login or sign in.
Marc: Yeah, here we go. Payments credit platform. Wow, you guys need a good URL like I have renewal.com yeah, you know.
Ivan LaBianca: You could probably sell that.
Marc: We've been asked a billion times. It's going to be one of our It's one of our assets.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, that's a good call out.
Marc: Dang.
Ivan LaBianca: Yeah, we would like to be nickel.com soon.
Marc: Who owns it?
Ivan LaBianca: No, I mean, it's something I think we're planning to get, but it's actually available. It's got just a kind of a, like a nickel trading information and some, somebody's, so I think it's, somebody's parked on it. Someone's parked on it. It's expensive, but I think it's worth it for building a brand with longevity to have the core.com. But yeah, you're lucky with that. That's nice. Yeah.
Marc: Yeah, I couldn't believe it. I wanted to get ahr.com like 27 years ago and ahr.com was taken. So I'm like, all right, renewal. No way I'll be able to get it. And that's when there was no GoDaddy. You had to register everything with Internic. Yeah, I'll be too young for that. But yeah, it's $100 for any domain. and it came back available. And I remember, like, trembling, like, are you kidding me? A word is available. I I couldn't believe it. I sent that 100 in so quick, hoping I got it. And over the years, we've had so many people ask about it. We've got some letters from attorneys. Not that we were parking on it, but. No, everyone wants to buy it.
Ivan LaBianca: Yeah, I know. I'm sure there's.
Marc: No, we've been offered money, and we're always like, it needs to start at six figures. It's just, it's not. We're not, which usually dismays people, but we had somebody kind of bite two years ago, get pretty close, like, you know, nah. It's a good asset when we sell the company or something or whatever one day. Absolutely.
Ivan LaBianca: Well, I'm sure it's helping you in that you could, like, it's easier to probably, if anybody looks up your website.
Marc: It'S going to be easy to find. Yeah. The bigger thing is there's a big national company called Renewal by Andersen. They're all over the United States. It's one of the biggest companies. and people, we get misdirected hits. Yeah. And sometimes there are people that are upset with that other company, but there's definitely people that are looking for Windows and it's like, nope. Yeah.
Ivan LaBianca: They're a window company, right?
Marc: Yeah. Renewal. Yeah, it's Anderson Windows. So they have a, they have a new replacement arm. Yeah. One final quick story. Somebody called me up once and he was trying to do a multiplayer game years ago when multiplayer games were just coming out. I'm like, Tell me what you're doing. I'm like, I gave him an idea what it was going to cost. He goes, oh. So I'm like, what are you doing? A multiplayer game? And he goes, yeah, we're doing it in Korea. I go, that's funny. My friend is the lead artist on a game called Diablo. I don't know if you guys have ever heard of that. Of course. Yeah, absolutely. He was the lead artist right here in the Bay Area. And he's like, Can I get his phone number? And my buddy Tom called me up the next day. He goes, Dude, I just got a six-month contract. I'm going to Korea to go work.
Ivan LaBianca: All because of a misdirect, you know.
Marc: Somebody trying to get asked me about renewal.com. Anyway, that's wild. What a great story. Yeah, it is. So I'm logged in. I played around with this. I mean, as simple as it gets, I guess. Yeah. Which I love, right? Easy UX, easy simple UI, whatever you want to call it. I guess because I've been out of it a few days, I just need some, maybe that's what today's call is. How will I integrate this as simply into using it? I just remember coming away very open to it and still feeling the same way. Yeah, I think the main thing is.
Ivan LaBianca: We just wanted to know, you know, what would stop you from handing the link over to your team? It looks like, I don't think you connected your bank account yet, did you?
Marc: Yep. I thought you did.
Colton O'Farrell: It doesn't look like it on my end. So I would go to account settings. Yes, account settings and then get paid within account settings. And at the very bottom it would say payment or payout method, payment method.
Marc: Oh, okay. I guess I missed this.
Colton O'Farrell: Once you add that though, you are good to send or receive payments. That is the last step that you would need in order to do that.
Marc: Mind if I do it while we're talking? I mean, I'll probably- Absolutely not.
Colton O'Farrell: Oh, that's what I was going to do.
Ivan LaBianca: Yeah.
Marc: Okay. What does it want? My cell phone number. Okay, sure. Take my cell. Okay, let me get a code. I feel bad you guys are like, Baby stepping me.
Ivan LaBianca: Oh, no, you know, Mark, to give you context, so, I mean, you live in the Bay Area, so this isn't new to you, but there's a lot of payment platforms out there. And the reason I'm on the call, Colton's on here, he's on the sales team, but I'm on the growth team and I'm trying to understand, you know, when I saw your business, we, we talked to businesses like yours and we're just trying to understand what the pain points are and what the little blockers are.
Marc: And like, one of the. Yeah, yeah, I
Ivan LaBianca: get it. You get it. We're like, oh, well, we like to collect at the end of the job. Right, like I told you. And so we're, I think one of the things we're probably gonna invest heavily in is building mobile. So it's really, really easy for you to, and, but it needs to be something that then you're, you don't have to have, but you can, you know, and just, that's what Understanding your problems is our problem. If that makes you feel better.
Marc: Say that does. Okay, let's see. The Plaid connector is asking for an access ID and a password. My bank requires this number, my login. And so I just tried, I'm gonna try something different. Let's see. It's weird because I think you guys are using Plaid, right?
Ivan LaBianca: Yep, yeah, yeah.
Marc: It needs to ask me three. Yeah, everyone use it. I think it's, there's really three pieces of Information to credential, yeah, couldn't connect. So let's see, let me go back. Are you sure progress will be lost? Yes. Where should we send your funds? Click to link your bank account. Okay, I'm looking in that. There's my phone number. Let's do this again. I got a code. Let's do it again. 600588. Select which account. There's my personal and businesses. Oh, this is before the bank changed its name. That's why add a new account. Commercial of Cal. Multiple available business password username. Okay, password, user ID. It's not going to be the number. There's no way you guys are going to be able to get in with just two pieces of identification. Let's see what happens. Maybe it'll come back.
Ivan LaBianca: It'll often do it if it'll text your phone. That's typically, I think, how it works.
Marc: There it is, company ID. Okay, I got to go back. I see what it's doing. I can't just go back after exit. Oh, no, go back. There it is. Okay. Now I can't just go back one step. The plaid. Okay, I got exit, sorry.
Colton O'Farrell: No worries.
Marc: I need to get a code again. All right, I get what it's going to do. Now I think I'll be able to get through it. 227-65-4-2-76-4. Okay, that's my phone number. Yep, add new account, commercial. So you're seeing the pain. This isn't very much pain, but the.
Ivan LaBianca: Main thing I was curious about was you talked about possibly a QR code and some of those things and just like, and so I was interested to hear on that side because that's something we're doing more and more. But yeah, unfortunately, business bank account, Plaid, banks changing names, that's all part of the course.
Marc: Oh, I, yeah, I don't know how.
Ivan LaBianca: Many times I've gotten.
Marc: Okay, company ID. So here's the third question. this hopefully should get me past all this shit. Yeah, I was with First Republic Bank, if you remember that fiasco two years ago.
Colton O'Farrell: Oh, I do.
Marc: Yeah, I was all on the news. Yeah. Raving fan. Best banking experience by far. Incredible. They did nothing wrong, but they got caught up in that Silicon Valley Bank thing and they went down. Okay, here we go. Text me, email me. I'm gonna have to go with email because the text number they have is wrong. So we'll do email. Continue. All right, let's see the code. I should have got it right now. Okay. I'm all plaid. Oh, there we go. Select main operating checking account. Bang. Heck yeah. I'm in, dude. Securely connecting one account to Nickel. Nice. Cool. Well, Marc, that's it.
Colton O'Farrell: I mean, you're ready to send or receive payments via Nickel. I know on the AP side, you're dealing with some variable rates between, I think, like three to 7%. The nice thing is with Nickel, that will be a static 2.9% on any accounts payables that you're doing. And then also your customers will be able to either pay you via ACH for free or pay you via credit card on the accounts receivable. So you won't have to worry too much about, you know, the, the manual kind of following of checks and the reconciliation with your bank.
Marc: Right. So let's what I was hoping to accomplish today because I heard that last time and I think you showed me a little bit of it. But obviously the pain point for me is like, what do I literally need to train now to my team to make this happen? Because I'm probably gonna shit can payment depot. So I'm gonna get rid of them and we will do all payments, I guess, through Nickel. And we'll either, we'll try to get people to use ACHs, because obviously it's in my best interest. But for those that have pre-agreed pricing to use a credit card, we will have, I'd love to see, I need to figure out how to get a QR code or how that works.
Ivan LaBianca: Yeah, yeah, I think the next step is use QuickBooks.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, QuickBooks online.
Ivan LaBianca: We should link QuickBooks. And then the second thing is the QR code creation is really easy. What you need to do is set up the payments portal. But you can go to QR.io is one site and your website and hit boom and you download the code. So that part, we can obviously do too, but you need to set up the portal. You're in Nickel right now, right? We can't see your screen and that's fine because I don't know if you have to enter.
Colton O'Farrell: I'm happy to demonstrate just a little bit here. So yes, within account settings. So this is the branding, the banner. So this banner here, On the get paid side, we do have this payments portal. And this is something that you could again embed right into your website. This will serve as a one-stop shop customer to make any kind of payment just directly they could, you know, pay by card.
Marc: I'm not just to stop you, I don't know that I see value at this moment in putting it on our website. I just not to the installers, right? Yeah.
Ivan LaBianca: So all you need is that link.
Marc: Yeah.
Ivan LaBianca: So what you can do, go back to the payments portal setup. I love the idea that they're oh.
Marc: You know, we're just gonna take our, the installer is gonna, we're gonna train them to like show them this QR code and they take it or something. But there's gonna be times the homeowner's not home, they're gonna call it in. I need to have, obviously, and I'm sure you have it here, there's multiple ways that we're gonna accept the credit card payment when it's a credit card.
Ivan LaBianca: And if it's an ACH, then we just need to, is the ACH also in a QR? Yeah, you can do it that same way.
Marc: What, can you share your screen out actually and let's, yeah, yeah, yeah. Let me remember how to do it. Do that. Let's see. Share. Okay, so I'm finishing this up, but I'll just leave it alone. Where do you want me to go? I can stop this, right?
Ivan LaBianca: Okay. Yeah, you probably need to do. Okay, got it.
Marc: Should I just finish this up real quick?
Ivan LaBianca: Yeah, you can stop for a second if you want. So you don't, we don't see. I think it hides your SSN, but.
Marc: I don't even care. Okay. I don't think you guys are coming after me. No, we're not. Let's see, 20. Come on, 1967. January 10th. Oh, it was a Tuesday. That's right.
Colton O'Farrell: Ivan, you know what day you were? Like the day it was when you were born? I was a Saturday baby.
Ivan LaBianca: I don't know, actually. I think I did at one point, but I don't remember.
Marc: Get paid. Okay, I thought I did this already, but okay. Community, no, that's not the right one.
Ivan LaBianca: Oh, yeah, you may have, okay.
Marc: Commercial Bank of California checking, yeah, that's it. Okay, let's hit that.
Ivan LaBianca: Hit save.
Marc: What's this edit payment amount?
Ivan LaBianca: Okay, so that would be if you want to let people pay less than the full amount. so if you send an invoice for 10, 000, they could pay you five.
Marc: Yeah, no, no, no. I think we need to talk, especially.
Colton O'Farrell: With your business model.
Marc: You.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, they should be very satisfied with what the work you've done and paid you all at once. Yeah, that's funny.
Marc: That routing number is wrong, but I guess I shouldn't worry about it. The routing number is wrong.
Ivan LaBianca: The fact that it connected, there may.
Marc: Have two routing numbers because these two banks just merged. I've been through Bank Hill, First Republic. Then I went to this thing called Community Bank of the Bay, who then merged with Commercial Bank of California. I think they now have two routing numbers because of the merger, and this.
Ivan LaBianca: Isn'T the one I'm familiar with, but I'm not worried about it. I think it'll be fine.
Marc: Can you scroll up on this page? Let's see what you have. Okay, great.
Ivan LaBianca: So you would want to have buyers pay the full amount. No, we pay it. So zero. Changes to zero. Wait,
Marc: wait, wait. Wait a second. So you pay it, but you Raise. The price of the invoice, right? We've done that in advance. So we're not surcharging at the end. For example, if I go to your house right now and said, you want all these windows and siding, it's 10,300. If you can pay cash, it's 10,000. You're like, well, I want to use a credit card. Well, it was 10-3.
Ivan LaBianca: We've got that built in. So the question is, 'cause actually, it's funny, it's on the contents. I actually just wrote a blog post 'cause I think California is
Marc: one of the states
Ivan LaBianca: that has some regulations about search. Yeah. So if you use the pass through, we are compliant with California. And so the way it would work is that you would basically get, when they have the link, they'll have exactly what you said, a built-in number. So you say the job is 10K cash or 10,290 credit card, and that's a nickel fee. And so you have the option to do it either way. So you could, But we know in.
Marc: Advance, it's not a last minute decision. Right, exactly. It's 10-2, we'll just use your example. It's 10-290 is what my production managers, if we know they're gonna use a credit card and it's been pre-agreed by contract, we're gonna be charging them 10-290, they don't pay anything.
Ivan LaBianca: It's already built in.
Marc: Okay. And if they agreed to cash check or ACH or whatever, then it's gonna be 10, and that was again pre-agreed. So we're not changing on them. we had to do this long. I think California does allow a surcharge. You don't have to be clear about it, but they used to, and it was unclear. So we, we said, what are the big guys doing? And they just play the game where it's built in and they drop for cash. Okay. Last half empty is my understanding is we're half full. If you drop for cash, it's okay.
Ivan LaBianca: You're not necessarily supposed to go up. So we, we built it that way. So there is a risk here, though, and what that is, is that if you do if you send them the option, they're gonna have the ACH option or the other option. You get what I'm saying? But then I have them contractually and.
Marc: Said, you shouldn't have tried to pay with us a Visa. Our agreement is for cash. And because our contract says it's a cash agreement. Got it. So we'd have to go back to them. And so I'm not, I appreciate what you're saying because these are the kind of little things where we can start.
Ivan LaBianca: You see what I'm saying, right?
Marc: And issues with our clients. We'll resolve it and as long as I can figure it out with these back and forth. Yeah, oh wait.
Ivan LaBianca: The question is, do you want to have it be the same amount on the final one? Because I think in some ways that's going to make it more likely that people actually are like, oh, well, I'll do credit card and get points. I didn't realize I could do that. And if you put the 2-9, at least you know that if they do, you're going to get the 10K and you're not going to pay the fee. So you can still say, I don't know. It's a, that's a little bit of a, because like a process change.
Marc: Yeah, I think art installers know, it's gonna be, yeah, if we get the, the thing, the whole thing, the point of pain, I love that you said that, is gonna be if they're given a code and they on their own, someone just did this with his fucking financing. We gave them the financing that we don't pay a dealer fee with our outside financing company. And then they, when they went on the internet, they went on their website, they saw that they could get, you know, one year, 18 months, no payments, no interest, and they switched that on us, which has a fee to us. And we had to go back and show them that wasn't what our price was agreed on. Luckily, we keep that stuff so we can go, Hey, this wasn't the deal. It does create a sticky situation, but as long as your thing is fungible or changeable enough that I can do this, The first time we have an issue, I can decide what way I'll have to work that out.
Ivan LaBianca: Yeah, there's another thing to know is you can actually change this on a per customer basis.
Marc: Right, I saw, no, you did mention that you and Colton mentioned that last time.
Ivan LaBianca: So this is for, but like, if you save this, this is global.
Marc: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So you have to do the default. I get it, right? Yeah.
Ivan LaBianca: As long as you know what it's doing, basically when you pay the two options, they're now going to look like the same price. And you're going to have to tell them you said you're paying ACH versus if you had it at 2.9, it will add that fee. So it's up to you how you want to deal with it as far as messaging.
Marc: And yeah, I guess the only thing I still not completely have my arms around the concept is if we give them a QR code, right? I need it to be-- Like ideally.
Ivan LaBianca: It should be QR code and only credit card link if they're doing credit.
Marc: Yeah, you guys don't do that, right?
Ivan LaBianca: What you could do is you could for the ACH ones, You could turn off the option to pay via credit card. That is, I don't know, can you do that on a prevoice basis?
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, you can do it on an invoice basis. So you would just go to your invoice. And if you know this customers, obviously you're going to know in advance.
Marc: You know in advance, yeah, show me that.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, so you would just go to settings on the individual invoice. So you would go to the get paid section. Sorry, in the far left tab. So right above bill pay. Yep, so you would open up, like click any of these invoices to open, oh, don't actually send it, so can you just click on the box right there? Click on that box. So go to settings on the far right hand side. Oh, rate up.
Marc: Oh, yeah, sorry.
Colton O'Farrell: So then you can do, oh, interesting, so we don't, oh, so I wonder, this might be disabling credit card payments for you because you're eating the full fee. Ivan, would that be, Yeah, I haven't.
Ivan LaBianca: Seen that before, actually.
Colton O'Farrell: So if you stop sharing for a.
Marc: Second, Marc, can you- Stop sharing.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, stop sharing for just a moment.
Marc: Go to- Oh, stop share. There you go.
Colton O'Farrell: So I'll share quick. Yeah, so I'm wondering if it's disappearing since you're deciding to eat the fee. But what I was saying is if you go here, click on any invoice, you go to settings, you could just disable credit card payments altogether for those people who have decided to turn that off. So this would just have the ACH option available.
Ivan LaBianca: The bigger problem is the ones where they say they're going to pay ACH and he doesn't want to have the credit card option. Or no, it would be the ones where they said they were going to pay credit card. Yeah, no, that should fix it. Basically only send the ACH link because what you want is you don't want them to think that they can pay credit card without a fee and then use the credit card.
Colton O'Farrell: And if you want to just test it for a moment, switch the global rule back to just them paying 100%, go click on an invoice and see if that disabled credit card option restates for you. I'm wondering, I didn't know we would just completely remove it if you're paying the fee, but...
Marc: So I'm going back to... Account settings.
Colton O'Farrell: Account settings, get paid. Yep, and change that back to zero.
Marc: Oh, no, 100. 100. Perfect.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep, I guess I never saved it. Yeah. So then go to get paid again.
Marc: Over here. Yep.
Colton O'Farrell: Click on just the invoice box.
Marc: Oh, there it is. Okay.
Colton O'Farrell: Settings.
Marc: There.
Ivan LaBianca: I do customized fees on this payment. What does that do?
Colton O'Farrell: That's going to override the global setting. So that would be where you would change, say, 50/50 for the credit card.
Ivan LaBianca: Yeah, but to be able to, oh, it's because he doesn't have Nickel Pro. Yes. Oh, yes.
Marc: Right.
Ivan LaBianca: Okay. Did you turn on, you had to turn on the Nickel Pro trial because the ability to hide the fee, and you're going to have to do that anyhow. We talked about that because your payment amounts are over 25,000 sometimes.
Marc: Oh, yeah.
Ivan LaBianca: But yeah, you were asking how we make money. One of the ways is that we don't allow you to turn off the credit card portal on your accounts receivable unless you pay a subscription fee. And the reason is because ACH costs almost nothing, but there's a small cost.
Marc: I'm not tripping on your form.
Ivan LaBianca: But as long as you turn on that trial, that's why that option that Colton showed isn't available. So you'd need to enable that on your account to see it.
Marc: So that's the one that's in between these two, I think?
Colton O'Farrell: It's the top one. So it's a disabled credit cards and that would be available once you're on.
Marc: Nickel in the audio. Right, yeah, you need the money to pay for, I get it, I mean, your business. So let me kind of, you know, 30,000 of you back up from all this minutiae. It sounds like there's ways for me, So I can have my installer show a cute, we're trying to get paid that day in those circumstances. You can show a QR code that I can then by having to come in. So I have to train someone to work on thinking about, you know, I'm.
Ivan LaBianca: Thinking about the couple of options.
Colton O'Farrell: Copy that link in account settings or the page.
Ivan LaBianca: Copy this link. Do you create the invoice before the job? Before they go on that final day?
Marc: No, we're weird, you know, because they. Sign a contract, it's usually a DocuSign, my installers come out with a completion document and at the end, at the very bottom, it just, they take down their...
Ivan LaBianca: But you don't create any QuickBooks invoices ever? Not usually.
Marc: Sometimes people ask us for an invoice and we try to go to the, you know, you have a contract with.
Ivan LaBianca: Us that's got the... So then this isn't relevant for you could, so you, one option is let's just do it, hit copy on that. And look at that. That the link that you get.
Marc: Open it somewhere up in here.
Ivan LaBianca: Yeah, open a new one. So this is option one is that you could just create a simple invoice in Nickel, very easy to create, and it will give them this option. And so you can see right now it has the fee. You can make it say no fee, and then if you have the Pro Plan, you can disable card. But then they get this set, here's the amount, here's the notes, that kind of a thing experience. And for this, I'd probably text it to them. You could have your reps text it, you could have them email it, or you could create a QR code, but it'd be you're creating one for each one, which is a little noise. I'd probably text it. But what's probably more relevant, or first let's stop there, could that be useful or you want more of a general payment link?
Marc: Let me see what it looks like to them. I almost never do this. Well, not save, I just want to open it. Yeah, that's interesting. It's probably what my production manager's sending it when people don't go away when we just like, yeah, the contract. Now I want an invoice, like, okay. Yeah. My production manager might love this. He might go, oh, this is all the crap I.
Ivan LaBianca: He doesn't have to make an invoice, maybe.
Marc: Yeah, yeah. the bottom line is, I mean, I I totally appreciate what you guys are doing. And I know, Ivan, you're trying to see, like, for building things, what my experience is, and I I really appreciate that. I almost feel like I'm seeing enough functionality that I almost. I'm. I'm almost not the right person as the owner. I need to speak to the. Yeah. Production manager who deals with my crews that he's responsible to get them to get us paid. 90% of the time and on the 10 that nobody's there to pay us, then he's got to deal with them. He's got to get his fingers in this thing. And I think you have enough opportunity that we'll be able to figure it out. I just don't want to hear him belly aching like, oh, now I gotta. Go in with Nickel. Can we show the one of all of them?
Colton O'Farrell: What's that? Which would you guys say? I was gonna say, well, first of.
Marc: All, what is your production manager's name? His name is Keith. Keith? Nice. And if I could give, he's really great. you know, younger than me. So he's really great with online finding the paths through these kind of probably.
Ivan LaBianca: Be able to just figure it out.
Marc: Yeah, I think he's gonna figure it out. But if not, if he, you know.
Colton O'Farrell: If he can get on.
Marc: Yeah, it sounds horrible. I I see enough. And I think you guys said you're giving me a 30 days. I think I just need to go, dude, we're doing nickel. Here's. I can give a login, right? I think. Yeah. Yeah.
Colton O'Farrell: Because how many people can log into this?
Marc: I'm plus unlimited. On plus, you'll have unlimited. Yeah. Yeah. Because I'm going to plus. I mean, I'm just. you're giving to me for free because I need to see the full functionality. So do I need to get a credit card to get it moving to.
Colton O'Farrell: Plus so that I can. Or what do we do?
Marc: Yeah.
Colton O'Farrell: Ivan, how does this best work? Because I know you will, Mark, you'll already have 14 day, like, free trials.
Marc: Yeah. That. And then we can just add an extra, like, two. Yeah, just double it up. You don't mind. I'm gonna be in or out. I I'm. Dude, I'm 90, 95 sure I'm in. I just don't want to go back and go, dude, this is so problematic.
Ivan LaBianca: Because we're gonna have to now have somebody else do something like this on every single invoice.
Marc: That's the part I'm just. Can I show you the other side. Of it real quick? Because I Go a bit back to your Nickel account. Is that a complete.
Ivan LaBianca: Far right? So this is what the customer is seeing. But go all the way over to the right on your tabs and just click on the one that says Nickel.
Marc: Oh, you got it, you got it. Yeah.
Ivan LaBianca: And then close that out. And now go to Accounts Payable, the Bill Pay. Yeah, go to, nope, go to Get Paid. and then click on payments portal. You see where it has dedicated payments portal at the top. This is the link you could send to anybody. And you can change out the branding. You can make that picture at the top and he'll know how to set this up. You can even make it at your link so it can just be at renewal. So if you want, that is enough.
Marc: I mean, this looks fine to me.
Ivan LaBianca: But yeah, I'm not trying. And this is what, and so like, try this out. So he's on, you're on the job site. You can access this on your phone, put in, you know, 10, $10,000. And then put in, you know, whatever you want. It can be the name of the job, it can be an invoice number. Yep, there you go. Make payment.
Marc: Careful now.
Ivan LaBianca: You got your options. And so this is basically what, that's probably what would make the most sense in your case.
Marc: So, yeah, so if 80% of our stuff is cash, check ACH. This is gonna be good. And then if they decide to go direction by card, go ahead, you changed on us, fine, pay $10,299. But when we know it's a card, I guess, when we know it's a card, I guess that's the only time we'll need to go in and get rid of it so that they're not pissed off going, Hey, our deal was 10K with a card. Why am I paying $300 more? Because then I can see somebody going that. That's the very last experience with these guys. They were trying to gank me for 300 bucks. We don't want that. So, and that's maybe only one to two out of ten. It's not that big of a deal. For someone to do that ahead of time, I guess.
Ivan LaBianca: Yeah, and if you don't get that information ahead of time and you just, like I said, you could give them the choice at the end, it's up to you. Because you could find, maybe, because it sounds like you built that process to get around the regulation, right? And this might just solve your issue for you, where it's like, it's up to them. Unless you're, I think maybe you were charging one extra percent or something, we're charging 4%.
Marc: I think we give a 5% discount in our, we have a waterfall pricing and I think we give five off if they go cash. So we're actually, giving them a bigger discount than we would pay. And so most people do that. It's a, but that's just that, you know, that's internal stuff and I don't mind sharing it with you. I just don't know that it's super relevant there, but I think I see enough functionality. I'm just, my only concern at this moment is will he, and these guys gripe about everything. Anytime I, you know, anytime you pull the carpet out and a new thing, next thing I know, six months later, like, I love it, you know? We started using monday.com for our Gantt charts and everything and at first like, dude, blah, blah, blah. And you know, a year later, like, how's money? He goes, oh, dude, I got my arms around it's great. I'm like, you don't even remember you hated it. So I may be like that. I just don't know yet. And that's why 30 days is going to be great. Yeah. I suspect I see enough and it seems easy enough that he might go, yeah, I don't like this part, but I love these other things and overwhelming from my perspective. I was paying a little more than three. This is three across the board. And I was paying 500 a year with Payment Depot. So not that $80 is a big deal, but and we didn't have any kind of an interface like this. This looks lovely. And you're telling me this all goes in through QuickBooks? Yep. Yeah.
Colton O'Farrell: That's badass. The other thing, Marc, too, if you go back to the Nickel tab itself, if you have peers, friends of yours that are in the business that want their own Nickel account, if you get two referrals over to Nickel, I mean, it pays
Marc: for itself plus gives you 50 bucks. Just. Yeah. Yeah. We would. If I'm a raving fan. I mean, I used to talk about First Republic Bank all the time, ironically, but, yeah, I used to be like, holy, you got to go over this bank. They're unbelievable. And, you know, they went out. But, yeah, I I like what I'm seeing so far. I just, you know, I don't do everything. I'm just a stupid owner, and I pushed a lot of procedures down, and I have to hear their belly aching, and I can push past a lot of it. In the end, I'm the ultimate. the CEO, but you know, I obviously respect my people and but I've also learned to not go with their first reactions like anyone else. They just people are, you know, creatures of habit. And I just have to show them this.
Ivan LaBianca: So can you do one thing for me, Marc? Can you copy? Go to that payments portal that was in your payments portal on that screen.
Marc: Which one again?
Ivan LaBianca: Payments portal. Yeah, now click copy this link. At the top. So just go up.
Marc: Yep.
Ivan LaBianca: Copy it, Command C. Yep. And then go create a new tab. I don't know if you've done this before, but I just want to make sure there's no blocker. Type in QR.io. Click on or actually put it in, actually this is an ad. Go all the way up to the very, very top. Where it says Bing at the top.
Marc: Above there, where the URL?
Ivan LaBianca: The URL. Type in QR.io there.
Marc: Yeah.
Ivan LaBianca: And now drop your URL that you paste that in there. And then now you have your QR code.
Marc: Yeah.
Ivan LaBianca: This is how, but that's what I would do is just have them, just in case anybody's questioning, how are we going to use this on the job site? And you could print this out, you could use it on your phone. And it looks like they, you may have to create an account to download it, but there's a bunch of services. It's basically they just are taking the text and converting.
Marc: I did this once on something. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Colton O'Farrell: We have other customers who've done this. It's worked really well for them, even some of them just like printing it out, having it there in case a customer is trying to say that they you know, can't pay for whatever reason and they're gonna send a check in the mail, like they have it right there for them. So there's no excuses.
Ivan LaBianca: But what we'll do, so you, I would just- Probably a JPEG for the phone.
Marc: Yeah, it doesn't really matter.
Ivan LaBianca: Connect Keith with create an account. Maybe we should do that if you want to send him an invite right now.
Marc: Yeah, let's do that real quick. Nickel.
Ivan LaBianca: Yep, and go to account settings.
Marc: Users.
Ivan LaBianca: Yeah, members.
Marc: Members. Yep.
Ivan LaBianca: And then invite and just give them full access. Yeah, I would make him an admin.
Marc: Yeah, he's an admin on most of my other things.
Ivan LaBianca: And then you can also make members who can do smaller stuff. And then right there where it says upgrade, if you need to add the card, that's where you do it to go ahead.
Marc: So why shouldn't I be upgrading right now?
Ivan LaBianca: Because you might as well do that, honestly.
Marc: Yeah. Yeah. And if I, if I could with for 30 days, you guys, yeah, you'll take care of me.
Ivan LaBianca: So we'll take care of you.
Marc: Yeah. Yeah.
Ivan LaBianca: Honestly, that's, that's, so that's what we'll do is just let's use a credit card. Yeah, you can use a credit card.
Marc: Yeah.
Ivan LaBianca: Let us know if you don't like it and we can refund.
Marc: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Ivan LaBianca: 30 days. So you will, you may get charged, but we'll refund it.
Marc: I know. Dude, I don't see He'd have to bellyache so hard because you're slightly you're about same price as my current payment processor. So he's just got to go to me, Mark, I just don't see how this will work. And if it doesn't, you don't want me to have it anyway.
Ivan LaBianca: I mean, we're not going to. Yeah, it's just. No, we want you to be happy with it. Yeah, you would never know what the blocker was so we could figure out.
Marc: How to build it though. But if you want to share. Yeah. Yeah. But thanks. All right. Well, I don't think I I think it's it's we it's passed my test enough that I'm here. I'm happy. Let me know. I gotta immediately call him and go, dude, you just got something I need you to go on and play around. And then Colton, do I tell him.
Colton O'Farrell: To speak to you if he's really.
Marc: Yes. Yeah. Let him start with me.
Ivan LaBianca: I don't want him to bug you.
Colton O'Farrell: And because I don't think the bug us. Some of that. No, it's no. I would love to speak with Keith.
Marc: Okay. Let him know you can send in my information. Jesus, guys, for something from my perspective, that's 420 a year. Your service is too ridiculous. I don't know if it's something special right now because. But this is crazy good. And I'm, to me, that's really suggestive of the tightness of the company. So I appreciate it.
Ivan LaBianca: Yeah, I mean, full disclosure, like the big part of the reason why is because we want to figure out how to make sure that people can come self-serve on our website, understand that this will work for them and figure it out. And so that's the fun thing about working with the kind of earlier stage company is that, you know, I mean, we could get the CEO on your, he might join if he thought it was interestingly enough.
Marc: Is that Foo?
Ivan LaBianca: Yep, yep, because we're relatively small still and we're going fast, but we're backed by DeWalt and Black and Decker and they see there's a home here and.
Marc: Want to I got some stocks, some SW, is it SWK? I forget with that. I got some stock, not much. Chart of accounts. Pick an account, link to your credit card payment.
Ivan LaBianca: What is that?
Marc: I'm paying with a credit card. Wait a second.
Ivan LaBianca: Wait, did something strange happen there? Pick an account from your chart of.
Marc: Accounts in your accounting software.
Ivan LaBianca: And there's no way to exit out.
Marc: Of this screen, is there?
Colton O'Farrell: Click out of the box once.
Marc: Well, I just hit escape, but it's for a payment method. I'm paying you. Oh, if I'm paying. Yeah, yeah, wait, okay. So it is, I'm using my capital one.
Colton O'Farrell: I think you just need to select, right?
Marc: Yeah, yeah, there we go.
Colton O'Farrell: I don't know why we got confused.
Marc: There, but yeah, Brain Fart again, Capital One Visa. Do you need me to do anything else? I saved it.
Ivan LaBianca: Okay, close out from this code.
Marc: We do it one more time, save it. It's then ask me again, I'm clicking it. Okay, go back, I guess.
Ivan LaBianca: Yeah, hit go back. Okay, oh, interesting. So create, okay, go ahead and hit Start Free Trial.
Marc: Yeah. Okay.
Ivan LaBianca: All right. Thanks, Marc.
Marc: Yes.
Ivan LaBianca: Sorry, I have no time.
Marc: Take a look at that yourself.
Ivan LaBianca: Yeah, maybe you guys can help me. That's helpful feedback. Amazing.
Marc: You should not have to find me by your own website. Oh, yeah. Take a look at that. I'm good, guys.
