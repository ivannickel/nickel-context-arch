Jacob Greenberg: Hey, Nathaniel, how's it going?
Nathaniel Seekins: Hey. Good. Yourself?
Jacob Greenberg: So far, so good.
Nathaniel Seekins: Awesome.
Jacob Greenberg: Cool. I have 30 minutes on the calendar for us. Is that all right?
Nathaniel Seekins: That should be good.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, Fantastic. Okay, cool. Tell me a little bit about your, you know, your company trueforce Capital, and how you came to find Nickel and what you're looking to get.
Nathaniel Seekins: Sure. So, True Course Capital, we manage several portfolio companies. We're a holding company, and I'm looking for a way to reduce ACH payment fees. We're building out some ERPs that are in both of our multiple portfolio companies. Right. So we've got a portfolio company that does boat repair, for example. We're building out an ERP there and transitioning all of our customers from using paper checks to using digital payments. And same thing with another legacy business we have, which is a wholesale bakery. Again, everyone is using digital paper checks. We want to push people toward using digital payments. So I'm looking for a provider that can help me integrate our payment cycle using digital payments. Right. So right now, the developer was using Stripe when he was building out the. The program for us on the boat.
Jacob Greenberg: Werks.
Nathaniel Seekins: Stripe, like, their fee structure is pretty atrocious, and we're using Xero as the accounting software on both back ends. So in an ideal world, we find a solution where we can partner with nickel to, you know, to make some online payments or digital payments in both of those businesses.
Jacob Greenberg: Cool. That was really thorough background. Thank you for giving me. No, no, it's. I was gonna ask all those questions eventually, but I'm happy that we lined really quick. So are there other businesses that you guys are working with that you'd want to bring into the fold besides the boat repair and the wholesale bakery? Are those like, just top of mind for you or is that specific?
Nathaniel Seekins: Yeah, those are the sort of big red, glaring ones. We do have a metal fabrication shop, um, but most of those are currently online payments through the ERP there. We're not wild about that, but that's on the back burner because it's not as pressing.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha.
Nathaniel Seekins: Sure.
Jacob Greenberg: Can you tell me the revenue of these companies? So I have an understanding of the amount of processing they're doing for accounts receivable.
Nathaniel Seekins: Yeah. So each of those companies are doing about well. So the boatyard is doing 3 million, and the bakery does 4ish right now.
Jacob Greenberg: In the metal fabrication shop, they're at 4 as well.
Nathaniel Seekins: Hopefully bigger next year.
Jacob Greenberg: Nice. Hopefully we can grow that number a little bit by switching. Switching the nickel and saving on ACH and credit card as well.
Nathaniel Seekins: Absolutely.
Jacob Greenberg: You guys are trying to digitize this payment process a little bit, push people from check to ach. What percentage of the business so far would you say is currently check versus credit card versus ach? Like what state is it in for collections?
Nathaniel Seekins: I would put it. Okay, so the Boatyard, they are using QuickBooks with like the merchant services. So they're getting some payments through there. Fully about half and half at the boatyard, where half of them are checks and half them are digital payments. And within that digital payment sphere, maybe 10 to 15% are credit cards and the rest are ACH through QuickBooks Merchant Services. At the bakery, it's like 95% paper checks. Yeah, Bad.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha.
Nathaniel Seekins: So painful.
Jacob Greenberg: So for Boatyard, I know you're saying they're using zero for accounting, but they're also using QuickBooks for merchant services.
Nathaniel Seekins: Well, we're moving towards zero across the whole portfolio.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha.
Nathaniel Seekins: So right now they're using QuickBooks. These are businesses that are legacy businesses that we have purchased. Right. So they are 40 year old businesses. We're now coming in and modernizing.
Jacob Greenberg: Accounting. Tool of choice is zero, correct?
Nathaniel Seekins: Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: For the metal fabrication shop with the ERP they use, do they accept a lot of credit card or is that mostly ach?
Nathaniel Seekins: That's actually mostly credit card. So they'll take a deposit from a customer? Well, I say mostly the. The retail ish customers are almost all credit cards. They'll take a deposit and then they'll run the rest of it after the job's done. The. The larger jobs are either wires or ACHs.
Jacob Greenberg: Now across the board, are there other merchant services? So for like the bakery. I know you said it's 95% check. Do they have anything in place to be able to accept credit card or ACH at this point or are they just only doing check and cash?
Nathaniel Seekins: Yeah, if somebody wants to pay by credit card, they. So along with the wholesale bakery, we also have a full service restaurant there as well, same brand. And so they push all of the credit card sales if there's a credit card sale, they push it through the restaurant. Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: On their point of sale system.
Nathaniel Seekins: Correct. Yeah, that's Clover. Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: Oh, okay. I would advise changing from Clover just from my background in restaurants. A couple years back I used to work at Toast. Clover was like, it just hurt my heart watching restaurants use Clover. Oh my God. Because they're paying so much and they're struggling at the same time and they get. It's just like, holy crap.
Nathaniel Seekins: Yeah, yeah. We. So we walked into that this, this summer so we are getting our feet under us with that business and we would. Clover would be one of the first things to chop for sure. We like toast.
Jacob Greenberg: Anything. Toast is great, square is fine, anything but. Clover is my love it. But yeah, they're both great. Okay, cool. So yeah, I'll show you a little bit inside the solution, the big thing here. Have you evaluated other tools? Like I know you, you had stripe at the boat repair company but you're looking to do something else. Have you been evaluating any other solutions besides Nickel or Stripe or.
Nathaniel Seekins: No, we're really at the beginning of this journey and you know, you do a Google search for something like Free Ach and you guys pop up pretty fast. So that's why I got in touch.
Jacob Greenberg: What's the most important thing that I could solve because I know we have a limited time, what's the most important thing that I can solve for you? Besides the pricing which is off the bat, Free ACH credit card fees are going to be compliantly passed on to the customer. So pretty much no fees unless you're doing regular transactions over $25,000 per transaction. You could sign up on nickel for free with no fees and start using it to today. Our plus platform is $35 a month. It enables transactions that are $25,000 and greater as well so on cap transaction sizes and one day quicker turnarounds. So for the plus it's a two day ACH turnaround, next day credit card turnaround for settlement for the core, which is our free solution, three day ach, two day credit card. Those are the big differences there. Besides pricing, is there anything that's like utmost important in making this decision to use across your company?
Nathaniel Seekins: The primary thing for me is ease of integration, right? So we've got existing processes which are flawed to begin with. But I want the new systems or the new processes to be seamless. So you know, show me what you can when it comes to how we would integrate with you guys.
Jacob Greenberg: So I'll tell you off the bat, the only two way integration that we currently have built out is with QuickBooks, QuickBooks Online specifically. So that's going to automatically sync anything coming from ERPs that are built into QuickBooks CRMs that are built into QuickBooks. Whenever an invoice is generated in QuickBooks it'll automatically populate in nickel. Whenever it's paid or settled, it will automatically populate that information back into QuickBooks for reconciliation. That's the only two way sync that we have built out. We have come across zero before we do have Some customers that use zero, it's not a direct integration, but in certain instances, like we might consider, and this is going to be just a longer implementation process building what's called an AI agentic sync. So we do this, this or webhooks rather than using a two way API, just because it's quicker to build, it's a little bit more secure for data purposes for your customers and the compliance of storing private data processing information. So it's just slightly more secure and quicker to build. It's on a case by case basis. But we have been known to work with certain organizations that have several companies and hit a certain amount of processing projection to build those integrations themselves. And it's not something I have a demo environment for. So I can't show you exactly how the integration would work if it were to be built out, but I can walk you through what Nickel would look like and put in the placeholders of. Hey, this information would be coming from Xero.
Nathaniel Seekins: Sure. Yeah. I think just conceptually what I would love to be able to do is say in the bakery erp, right. We send out an order or deliver the product, we hit a button, it sends an invoice with the link that goes to Nickel. Is that, is that even remotely possible?
Jacob Greenberg: So walk one more time. You're in the bakery, you need to send out an invoice to a customer.
Nathaniel Seekins: Yeah. So I send out an invoice from. Not from Zero, but from our erp, for example. Okay. And I would love that invoice to have a click here, right. To make payment.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, let's walk through this. What is the ERP that you guys are using?
Nathaniel Seekins: It's custom customs.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay.
Nathaniel Seekins: Yeah, yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: I'll walk you through a couple different options for what people do. And it's a. It will be. You could either have a generic payment portal that you can include in a link to everything and then people can enter what they're, the reason they're paying, and the amount that they're paying on their own.
Nathaniel Seekins: Hold on just a second. I just need to yell at my wife for a second. Sorry. She's about to drive away with all my tools and I need it. I need some tools this afternoon.
Jacob Greenberg: All right, cool. So I'll walk you through this briefly here. What you would be looking at doing. I'm going to. I'll give you a full walkthrough of the platform, but I want to just highlight your specific use case so that we can make sure we tackle it before we hit that hour mark here. There's a couple different ways you can approach this. One is we do have some customers that have a pay invoice link that's on their website and it's a generic cap like all capture pay invoice. So if you're sending something out from a different erp, you could copy this payment link, you could put it in every the same link in every single invoice and leave the customer to enter the reason for payment as well as the payment amount. And if you would like, we could customize this portal for you. So it has different fields, different text, different words, different things it's capturing. So if you want them to put an invoice number, et cetera, you can put a field for that. And what would happen is when they go to make the payment they would choose to pay by card or they would choose to pay by bank and either way they need to put in their contact information, name and email and that would store here on your customers tab. So you'd be able to keep track of all the customers that you have, all the invoices that have gone out to them, even if it's more of a generic payment portal link. But if you are sending out things from an ERP you could copy, you know it will be your bakery name.nickelpayments.com you can embed this in every single email that goes out every invoice. You can put it in the template and then they'll have the option to click into it and pay and then return to the company website or return to an email if they want to. That's one method that would be the kind of catch all blanket method. What a lot of our larger industrial companies do when they have a unique ERP system and for some reason they choose not to do a direct integration with nickel, choose not to do agentic integration or we don't have the capability to support it. In certain instances what they'll do is they'll go into nickel. You create the invoice in the process of creating an invoice in nickel will be lighter weight than within the erp. You won't be adding the line items or the details of everything. If you're going to be sending out the email from the erp, right. So I would put in customer information. I'll put in my email address here so I can show you what it looks like to receive this actual invoice. When we send it invoice number, make sure it syncs with the ERP the amount. As I'm doing this, I also want you to consider sending out the invoices from Nickel instead of from the erp because it actually might be a better presentation and better for internal organization's sake. So you would take the information from the invoice generated in the erp. You could add any additional information and notes for customer. Here you would have the date as well as the due date. So if you're going to do net terms, you could set that to due date and you could even set this as a recurring payment if you have those. This is for the bill pay side if you're making payments or if you're receiving payments as well. And for a lot of our industrial customers, what they'll do is they'll actually request from their new customers when they onboard them payment authorization to auto charge them on a due date. This way you're not sending out account requests anymore for account receivable requests. You're just processing the payments when they're due. And I'll show you what that looks like as well. Cool thing here is you can upload any amount of documents that you see fit. So let's see. I have a sample invoice. This is for some reason always the hardest thing to find on my computer. Every single time I do this, I can't find. There we go. You could add a sample invoice. So like the line items that are populated from your ERP or from Xero or whichever tool you're using to generate the invoice, you could also put net terms agreements in here, product photos if you're doing repairs, photos of the boat, stuff like that, everything can live within a single transaction portal between the company and the customer. On the advanced side, there's a couple settings. The one I like to highlight is you can enable your customers to edit the payment amount. So if you want to just accept a certain deposit at a certain date of the entire invoice, you don't need to do multiple invoices if you don't want to. But you could still continue to break those out or if they want to, you know, it's a large bill for the boat repair, say it's 25, 30,000. They could split it if they want, half for credit card, half for ACH on their own. And it doesn't affect your books whatsoever. So once that invoice is created from within here and I, I'm pausing to talk through each step along the way, but if you had the numbers and the contact information, it takes two seconds to create an invoice like this within nickel. One thing Some of our customers will do, if they do send out invoices from a different system, is they'll copy this link. This is a unique link for this invoice. And they would put that in the other system where they're sending out that email.
Nathaniel Seekins: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: And that will copy like this.
Nathaniel Seekins: Right. Which is. Which is exactly how? Not exactly, but it's very similar to how the current customers at the boatyard see things with QuickBooks. Right. It's a. It's a link on the invoice and you get to a page like this when you make your payment. Right.
Jacob Greenberg: The other option here would be to send it directly from Nicolle. Put the information that you have in the ERP here, and you're literally just using this to generate. And we have a tool to make it easier to reconcile the books within nickel, even if it's not directly integrated. So I could show you that as well. But you could send the link from within nickel via text message or by email. And it will come in like this. It would be the company name and then the invoice number or memo. So this would be, you know, the boatyard and their logo. You have a payment request, who it's from and the amount, due date, some basic information. All the attachments are embedded directly into the email. So if the invoice is being generated from your erp, you plug it into Nickel and then bam, it goes to the same location. Some quick things to highlight here is you could pay by card or pay by bank. Pay by bank is completely free. Pay by card incurs a 2.99% fee for the customer. As an option, they could choose it, they don't have to. And we will automatically update the total that they'll be charged on your behalf so that there's no like. It keeps your books clean. You're only what they're due, what they owe and what they pay is going to be automatically settled on your side and hold from here. If they had previous bills with the same company, beneath this you'll be charged section here will populate previous and historic transactions which they can click into. So if they have an outstanding bill, they're able to quickly see that they have an outstanding bill, click on it and complete it as well. And by clicking on any of the PDFs that are attached, they'll be able to download them as well. And it's very, very straightforward in that way.
Nathaniel Seekins: So when you've got the payback card with a fee. The boat yard is in Main, Maine, is one of the very few States that have laws in the books that you say you have to, you can't charge credit card fees at the point of sale. How do you guys deal with that?
Jacob Greenberg: So nickel is compliant across the country. This is essentially a service fee for utilizing credit card and nickel, not a surcharging fee. And you're, you're offered both options to.
Nathaniel Seekins: Pay by bank or pay by credit card.
Jacob Greenberg: And if you wanted to look up, we actually have pretty thorough resource of this, of all the surcharging laws by state. So you can go to get nickel.com surcharge loss. So okay to read any of these.
Nathaniel Seekins: Cool. Yeah. So going back to data entry in nickel, when creating an invoice, is there a way for us to populate that data from the ERP and then get that link or have that sent from nickel after the data is populated?
Jacob Greenberg: So creating the invoice or populating the data in the ERP and then sending everything out from nickel.
Nathaniel Seekins: Right.
Jacob Greenberg: So what you would do if there's not a direct integration, if we don't have the ability to build AI agentic integrations, which if we do it would be a slightly longer conversation and it wouldn't happen overnight and I just wouldn't expect it to be done very quickly. But we have in the past. But say there isn't that direct integration, you would be creating the, you'd be generating that information within the erp, coming to Nickel, typing in the customer and creating the invoice from within here, making sure that the information aligns with what's on the other side and sending out the transactions.
Nathaniel Seekins: So it's manual accounts payable.
Jacob Greenberg: Then if you want to update your books though within Xero that's less of a manual process. You could come into here. And so this is high level overview of all of your transactions, whether they're payables or receivables. You could filter for date for customer when they've been completed. We have a lot of people that just do a daily report. So they'll just search for today. I don't have any data from today. And at the end of each day they'll download a CSV or they could do weekly and then you'll upload that CSV into Xero or into your accounting system and we'll match and reconcile with your records there. So it'd be like an end of the day or end of the week or end of the month type of navigation. Other thing is you could just download it and keep it for your ledger in the notes section here you can either reconcile or flag any specific transaction. So if you wanted to make sure, hey, did I actually update this one yet in Xerox or was this adequately sent from zero to nickel and it matches correctly? I come in here and I click reconciled and when I export this report, that note will be a flag in the report as well.
Nathaniel Seekins: Makes sense.
Jacob Greenberg: So I know it's not a direct integration between zero and nickel right now. It is something I could get a touch point with my team and see if we have a timeline for building something like that out. That's more out of the box. But with that manual process, do you think that the consolidation of digital payments and the reduction in cost is still something that would be valuable for you guys? Book of business I think it is.
Nathaniel Seekins: Honestly I would have to kind of weigh up the cost of having someone do this manual work versus you know, versus the automatic fees from Stripe. That must be some math to do for sure.
Jacob Greenberg: What do you think about the idea of putting a custom built portal instead of doing the manual work, you would essentially do this, customize these fields for each company type and keep the same link in every single outbound email that's coming from the ERP system.
Nathaniel Seekins: I like that. Is there a way to make that link auto fill anything?
Jacob Greenberg: No, that's the only thing.
Nathaniel Seekins: Right. Because we're dealing, we're dealing with people who love paper checks. So they're, they're already a little bit technologically challenged.
Jacob Greenberg: The one other thing that I will put out there before I hop off is say we have a customer, we have this new customer here and I'm going to add a customer banking information. I could add it on my own with an upload of a payment authorization, meaning I can debit them whenever I choose or I could send a request. So if you have a new customer coming in, you'll get a payment authorization request. Go ahead and click on this. And it's a two step process where it tells you just a brief amount of information about why X company is looking to get this information, who is nickel, SoC2 compliance, et cetera, et cetera. Click get started and you just review and accept terms and conditions and you can select terms and conditions to read the whole thing on our website as well. And then they enter their banking information. And so they could literally just click the bank account and log in on their app on their phone or they could enter their card number. And once that's done you'll be able to, instead of selecting all of these and sending out all these payments, you can select Them and just make the charges right away. That's really going to reduce dramatically reduce the time to settlement outstanding bills and just manual processes in general for back and forth communications. So I do like that when you do that. It is SOC 2 compliant. We manage PCI compliance on your behalf. We store that information so that you guys don't have to. We're collecting authorization in terms of conditions for you and it's pretty comprehensive so makes it easy.
Nathaniel Seekins: Yeah, that's very attractive for sure. So anyone that we could get to move toward payment authorization, that'd be awesome. I don't know what the percentage of customers would be for that, but it'd be worth a try.
Jacob Greenberg: It works typically better for businesses like the boat repair than the bakery, right? Maybe repeat customers are project based customers.
Nathaniel Seekins: Yeah, exactly. Okay, cool.
Jacob Greenberg: Nathaniel, do you have any other questions for me at this time?
Nathaniel Seekins: No. What would it look like if we wanted to talk about tighter integrations?
Jacob Greenberg: So I would request some information from you. Write up a brief synopsis of some of the things you're looking to get integrated in the tech stacks that are relevant to each of the companies. So I know it'd be with Xero, but if there's any other ERPs, feel free to note that what they are, if they are custom made objectives you guys are trying to obtain and the amount you guys are processing or seeking to process through netco. I'll take that information. I'll schedule some time with one of my developers and I'll have a conversation with him about where this can fit on our timeline, what the current workload is for September, October, November, and if we can find a way to build this out. After that one conversation I'll be able to return to you with a little bit more insight, maybe a better timeline and who knows, maybe this is a good time to do it or it might be pushed to towards the end of the year, but it's worth asking and it's happened before. So if you could send me a little bit of information after this call about the tech stack you have at each of the businesses you'd be looking to onboard nickel for, I'd be happy to have that conversation on your behalf.
Nathaniel Seekins: Okay. Yeah, We've been developing the boatyard at ERP now for about eight months. It's a slow burner. Right. And we are transitioning slowly to that from they use QuickBooks for everything @ that point location right now and the bakery we are at in the infancy of creating that erp. So we're. Yeah, it's the door is wide open and the timelines are very fluid.
Jacob Greenberg: I guess the one thing I would say, okay, that's great information and please also forward it to me if you can at the end of this call with the boatyard and with QuickBooks, if they do currently have QuickBooks, what I would do first and foremost is create a free account for those guys. And this could be a good testing ground for you. Create a free account for those guys. Sync the QuickBooks account before you do a full migration away from it and all the data that you have for customer information and historic transactions will populate within nickel. And then you're going to be able to store all the historic data into this location as you transition over to Xero, you'll be able to continue doing transactions through nickel if you want to. In the meantime, it's just a good place to start and to test.
Nathaniel Seekins: So I would recommend you say that that's going to be QuickBooks Online, right? QuickBooks Online, yeah, they're on desktop.
Jacob Greenberg: Killing me. Yeah, QuickBooks is making. One of the reasons we've been slow to create a desktop integration is because QuickBooks is like really pushing everybody to go online and we don't even know when they're going to Sunset Desktop.
Nathaniel Seekins: Yep, I well aware.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, I'm sure you are. All right, Nathaniel, I have another call I have to hop to right now, but it was a pleasure talking to you today. I'd love to get some more information on if we could do the integrations for you guys. So please send me some information if you can that I can forward along to the dev team and I'll get back in touch.
Nathaniel Seekins: Okay, sounds like a plan.
Jacob Greenberg: Before I hop off, let's schedule a follow up call just so that I could either give you an update or see how the process has been for you if you've evaluated other solutions, etc. Sure. Would next Tuesday work for you?
Nathaniel Seekins: Let's have a look. Next Tuesday is no good, but next Wednesday is.
Jacob Greenberg: All right, next Wednesday I have 3:30pm.
Nathaniel Seekins: Eastern Time or 11:00am let's do 11:00am please.
Jacob Greenberg: 11 hours. Okay, great. I am sending it now. Just go ahead and accept it once you receive it. All right, cool. All right, great talking to you today and I'll see you next week.
Nathaniel Seekins: All right, thank you.
Jacob Greenberg: Have a good one.
Nathaniel Seekins: You too. Bye.
