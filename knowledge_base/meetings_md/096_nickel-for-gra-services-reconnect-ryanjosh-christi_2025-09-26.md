Ryan Jacob: I don't think so. We were going to send our first payment link to a customer today, getting to pay us and see how it goes. How do you feel about passing some of the processing cost? Yeah, they want to use a power trip. That's great. Yeah, that's great.
Christian Sheerer: Ryan, what's up?
Ryan Jacob: Hey, so sorry about that, man. I had you done at 2:30.
Christian Sheerer: No worries. I. I'm glad you caught me in.
Ryan Jacob: My brain but I mean, honestly, everything's going real smooth, so.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, honestly, I mean, yeah, I mean like I don't want to hold you hostage and make you say everything's going well if it's going well. And so like, you know, want to get out of here if that. If that's the case. And so, yeah, really just wanted to set up the time just in case you had any. Like I said when we, when we first chatted, like any things that we need to refresh or a difference in the workflow as it comes up or if you wanted to look at. I've seen you guys operate on both sides, but I know it's going to be primarily on the AP side. If you wanted to see on the ar.
Ryan Jacob: Well, we're gonna, we're gonna test sending a payment link out I think on that. Is it the customer side, the retail side or are we doing business? Yeah, look, I know you were gonna time on something small. Yeah, we're going to do a small test on an AR to see like how how it goes, how it ties in and so I can let you know how that goes once. We have tried it but so far the ACH payment has been great. Yeah. For the ap. Sorry. But the ACH side has been excellent so far.
Christian Sheerer: Awesome. Okay, cool. Yeah. And those have any. I mean, I guess now I don't want to grasp at straws and, and like bring up an issue but like any on their end, any notifications there when they receive. Vendors are good. I mean, sorry, when vendors receive bills, they're good.
Ryan Jacob: I don't think we've sent those. I think that's what we're saying. I think we're going to try to send. Oh, we're talking about when I pay the vendor. Yeah, yeah, no, I mean I put the logo on there and it shoots an email out to let them know that, you know, they're being paid today and. Or the payments coming through. So they've all been super receptive and most of them want ACH anyway. So yeah, we have a couple that want check and then so we just pay the fee. And the rest are all. Ach.
Christian Sheerer: Awesome. Okay, cool. Awesome. Yeah, I mean, we can. We can check in after that first batch of the AR side comes. It's really the same thing in reverse with just, like, slight differences because of it being in reverse. And, you know, for customer, like, everybody getting paid, it's like, hey, you got paid. They don't think twice about it. Customers might have some questions because it's just, like, a new process. It should be an easier process for them. And so then we can help fill those and, like, work through. Work through those kinks, if any of them present itself, and also kind of like, offer support in terms of, like, oh, here's education to our customers here. We're making it dead simple for you to pay us.
Ryan Jacob: Cool.
Christian Sheerer: And then I'm gonna.
Ryan Jacob: I'm gonna add another user. Cool. To get my. My office admin in it and kind of show her some stuff on Monday. But, I mean, I already let her kind of see what I was doing as she was putting the bills in. It's. I mean, it's really easy. It's great. I mean, it's working. So I'm like, oh, like, it actually works.
Christian Sheerer: Awesome.
Ryan Jacob: Thank God we're not relying on QuickBooks for the bill pay.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, I mean, there's like, you know, there's so many people that, like, come in. It's sort of like when we asked on Monday, or when you asked someone, he's like, hey, like, what. What's this? What do I owe you guys? And then I have to, like, sit back and laugh and be like, it's sort of the same thing on, like, the UI side. And so the other thing, too, just to be transparent, like, if any of these vendors or anybody on the customer side, you know, anybody who. Who you think would benefit from using us, we heavily invest in. In, like, the referral stuff, and we're very attentive to it. That's like, a lot of my outreach as well, which is kind of nice as a salesperson. Right. Because you just have, like, this big network that you can shoot fish at in this bucket. And so I'd be remiss and not doing my job well if I didn't bring that up and say, if you have anybody that you want to put in contact to with us, then, yeah, just use that referral link in the bottom left and send that over to them. Maybe that comes in down the line. So that's one thing. And then the other thing is, yeah, if Donna needs extra handholding as she gets going. But it sounds like, you have your head wrapped around it. We're available to do that, too.
Ryan Jacob: Sure. Yeah, it sounds great, man. Yeah, I'll do all the above. We have people who are. Because, I mean, it sends out notes pretty easily. And so some of our vendors may ask, you know, what we're doing. If they do, then I'm happy to send you a referral.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, cool. And this is another thing I like to ask, just personally, because, like, you know, our network, we see it. Right. So I might make some calls into the people that you're paying and see what's up. Very low touch, just to make sure everything's good on their end. Some people are sticklers about, like, hey, don't reach out to my. To my people. I just want to get the gauge, if that is a no from your side, to do so.
Ryan Jacob: I mean, we're paying them, so I don't know why they would care.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, Yeah.
Ryan Jacob: I think that's one thing if you're. If you're calling, like, our customer.
Christian Sheerer: But yeah, yeah, that's. That's.
Ryan Jacob: If you're calling people we're paying, like, I don't. I don't know. That's not my business. Cool. I mean, you can even tell them that, you know, we are updating our systems, and so far, things at GRA have gone really smoothly. And so you just wanted to reach out and. Or however you do your. I'm sure you got a. A pitch or whatever you want to do. But specifically, I know another smaller company that has multiple companies is. Moon is on there. One of our vendors, Moon. Moon Containers.
Christian Sheerer: Okay.
Ryan Jacob: They also own Moon Chemical and a couple other companies. And so they're, I think, 30 million maybe. So they're a little bit bigger than us, but they're probably an ideal size target in the same industry. Trying to think of. Some of the other ones are pretty big. Like, I don't know how far you'll get with, like, a Covestro or some of the larger companies we work with because they usually have more advanced systems and requirements. But maybe that works for you guys. I don't know. But, yeah, I mean, I don't care.
Christian Sheerer: Cool. No, no, I will. And yeah, even just the name drop is. Is nice to help me kind of, like, focus who I'm. Who I'm targeting. So I really appreciate that.
Ryan Jacob: I mean, it's been. We're very happy. We're excited. It's working.
Christian Sheerer: Cool. Yeah. And also, I mean, just to flag it, I won't hold you to it right now, but, like, we Might spin the block and be like, hey, you wanna. You wanna jump on a quick call interview and maybe do a case study?
Ryan Jacob: Sure, yeah. I mean, if it something that helps you guys. I've been in sales as a hunter for like 20 years, and so I get it. Cool. Especially if you're doing more in this, like, type of space. I talked to a couple, I'm in a couple of groups here in Oklahoma City, and I shared with a couple businesses that we switched and what we're doing. And so I may have some connections there for you too, if they want to look into you.
Christian Sheerer: All right, lovely. I. I will lean on it. Honestly, this is, you know, that that makes my job a lot easier. And also, yeah, I mean, we could keep it over email for now if things come up. Like, yeah, I don't want to just block off your calendar and mine to be honest, if everything's going smoothly. But as things come up, I'm happy to hop on ad hoc, fix things, you know, coordinate with support if anything is requ. Like technical fixes. And just to keep in the back of your head, if you just have, like, random ideas about things that might be a little bit more efficient as volume picks up, like, we want to hear those. We won't be shy about being like, hey, that's going to go lower on the roadmap. But if it's a quick fix, like, I walk over there and they're like, okay, that should take me five minutes to fix. I think we should make that fix. And they'll do it rather quickly.
Ryan Jacob: So the only thing that comes to mind so far is what we had talked about. So with QuickBooks, QuickBooks, if we were using a check, I could combine multiple invoices into a single check. And so I paid one check fee. But really with ach, since you guys are free, it really alleviates a lot of that pain anyway because, okay, I do three ACH transactions instead of one. All right. You know, it's not like it's free, so it's like, who cares? So that hasn't been as big of a thing. Nothing else really comes across. I'll keep an eye. I think my admin had some questions about. I think one thing we did notice happen with QuickBooks is if we create the bill in QuickBooks and do an attachment there, if we do the payment and nickel, it takes the attachment from QuickBooks and puts it in nickel, but it doesn't leave it in QuickBooks. And so not a huge deal because she's about to have access to nickel but because she hadn't had access yet, she mentioned, hey, I thought I put a PDF on here, but now I can't go back and see it. But if I open it up in nickel, it's there. And so that's weird.
Christian Sheerer: Okay. Yeah, let me.
Ryan Jacob: So I'm not sure if that's just like a bug or. I mean, she's not as technologically savvy either, but I mean, it wouldn't make any sense because she. It's in nickel now, but if I pull up that bill in QuickBooks, it's like the attachment's no longer in QuickBooks.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, that might, because it's default logic for the attachments to be in nickel as well. But it doesn't make sense as to why it would, like, steal it from QuickBooks, if that makes sense.
Ryan Jacob: So we ran into that a couple of times, but again, like, I showed her, well, in nickel, you're going to be able to look all that up anyway. And so basically what I just said is, hey, when we get you access, if you're looking up those bills, the UI on nickel is easier anyway. And so just look it up in there. And so that's kind of a fix. But if you have people in organizations that aren't all going to have access, that could cause some problems.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, I agree. I think that's, that's, that's, that's well taken. And so I'll just run that down to the person who manages the, the API.
Ryan Jacob: Yeah, I mean, other than that, if you could, like, in the event we do have a problem, I don't know if you have like a, like a best practice thing where, like, here is the best way to reach out because that would be nice to disseminate to, you know, the admin. Just say, hey, like, if you have an issue like this is you call 1-800-NICKEL or hey, chat nickel. Here's where you chat. I'm like, if you have something like that you can share too, that'd be helpful.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, yeah, I'll point you in the right direction. I mean, it's support get nickel. That's the, that's the best way is because then it routes it and pings it to whoever, like, is free on the support engineering side, who can go into it. But I will, I'll pull all that stuff on and like, quick, minor things, they catch it and they might suggest you the help center, like, which has documentation to like, narrow down. But then if you, you can always be like, hey, I need to talk to somebody. And we're always responsive, which is great.
Ryan Jacob: Too because I mean, and that's such a huge selling point. I'm sure you talk about that a.
Christian Sheerer: Lot, but like, yeah, we have to.
Ryan Jacob: I can't express how much that like how much it sucked trying to deal with intimate anything done like. I mean honestly, if they would have just made simpler, I probably wouldn't even thought to look. But because they over complicated so much and locked us out of our account because of the transition of presidents, it's, it's crazy to me. So yeah, I mean we're, we're excited working with you guys. I'm. I'm kind of curious. So I mean I know you guys make, you know, the, the $35, which is like not very much. How, how are you guys like, what's your, your business model? Is it off of. Yeah, so we take on the credit.
Christian Sheerer: Card a little bit.
Ryan Jacob: Yeah, the two point. Okay, so there's a little bit percentage.
Christian Sheerer: On the credit card and, and it's sort of like a hot dog at Costco situation, right? Wherein like we want to gain the favor of people using us and getting benefits from free. Ach. And it's like this is not going to be how the platform looks forever. Right. We want to do it in a methodical way where we can add things like a trade credit to build like cash flow advantages for people who are using us. And so what I mean by this is not how the platform will look forever is like those things will probably be add ons that I think that we're gearing up for. And then the other thing too is like if we grow the overall volume of people using nickel and they're connecting to all the different vendors that they have, all the, you know, people on the payments AP network, right. Who I can go to Moon and be like, all right, cool. You know, seems like you've already accepted payments through nickel. Why wouldn't you want to formalize that process? And ultimately as payments move more online, customers opt to use credit for whatever reason that they do. And so that's like the initial step and then the next step. And the stepwise function is like, all right, here's like a trade credit. Oh, here's like a project management tool that we can build off. Our thesis is that like payments are the, if you make an analogy to a body of the company, the blood, right. And so connects through to everything. And so if we can build like a really good architecture with that at the core, we can do a lot of fancy things on top of it. And nobody had built that for, you know, the built world industries that are mostly worried about software payments, like a stripe or something like that.
Ryan Jacob: How long has Nickel been in business?
Christian Sheerer: About three, four years.
Ryan Jacob: Okay, so I mean, you're still kind of in that startup mentality, but you have a few years behind you. I take it you guys are probably scaling pretty.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, yeah. I joined only a couple months ago and I think there will be some good news soon and also that the team will grow a lot.
Ryan Jacob: Awesome. Well, hey, we're excited so far. As long as you keep the, the simplicity factor, man. I mean, I think you guys have a huge opportunity ahead of you because again, like with everything I'm doing, like today's a little bit of a slower day, so I actually have time to give some information back. But like, I mean, I spent probably four or five hours on with into it trying to figure things out and still got shut out. And I was, it's just you have to use them for QuickBooks. Like there's no really. For us right now, there's not really another good solution. And that's what my, the founder started this company in. So we have information back from like the 90s in there, but knowing how technology is progressing, like, I don't know, give somebody an easier way to do those things where it all, you know, API connects or whatever. And I think, you know, people begging to change.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. And we're really excited about it just because of the people that we get to deal with too. It's like I've sold software previously, a place called Rippling, and it's like the majority of the people we're selling to are like other software companies and it's just like sort of a revolving door of Silicon Valley for, you know, venture capital money. Like, just like, oh, you know, this software company that raised this money is buying software from this company and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And so it's like not real. It's like not tangible to a degree. And so, you know, our founders are pretty passionate about like, you know, doing software, but like for people who are doing real things right in the real world. And so that's, that's, that's exciting for, for me at least.
Ryan Jacob: Where are you guys based?
Christian Sheerer: We're all in Brooklyn. Brooklyn in New York? Yeah.
Ryan Jacob: Yeah. I, I worked for a company, you probably haven't heard of them. It's called Amplify. They're in the education space. I actually got to, to fly out there a few times and check things. I worked for them for a few years, so It's a cool spot and.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, no, I love it. I love it. Yeah, I'll probably be here for a while before I, you know, sunset down into Florida, where I'm from, so.
Ryan Jacob: Florida. There you go. Okay. Well, awesome. Dude, again. I mean, I don't care if you call our people that we're making payments to. It doesn't bother me any because those are our vendors. On the customer side, we gotta be a little more careful because the. We deal with a lot of major utility companies.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah.
Ryan Jacob: So they have certain government things that they're worried about, but. And then consumers. Trust me, you don't want to talk to our consumer customers. You'll be dealing with the headaches we deal with. But yeah, on the vendor side, I mean, power to. You reach out. You can let them know that we're. We're happy and, you know, if they have questions, they can even ask us. I don't care.
Christian Sheerer: Sick. Yeah. Glad to have the green light. And I will. I'll follow up on those other things. The more immediate being like directing to you to where you guys can get support stuff and. Yeah, we'll keep in touch here and there. And I might lean on you for. As things continue to ramp up and go. Well, have you speak about the experience and we'll chat soon.
Ryan Jacob: Sounds good, man. Take easy.
Christian Sheerer: All right. You have a good one.
