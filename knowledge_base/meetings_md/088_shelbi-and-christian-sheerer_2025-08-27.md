Participant 2: This is Shelby.
Christian Sheerer: Shelby, nice to meet you. This is Christian.
Participant 2: Hi Christian, nice to meet you. Brenda's joining us in one second.
Participant 1: Awesome.
Participant 2: She's just gonna join me at my desk.
Christian Sheerer: Oh, okay, awesome. Should we give her a second to get started?
Participant 2: Yes, please.
Christian Sheerer: And. Well, I guess I can ask her, but what does Brenda do?
Participant 2: We're both owners of the company.
Christian Sheerer: Awesome.
Participant 2: So we typically work in the office, all office related, non-field.
Christian Sheerer: Are you there?
Participant 2: Possibilities.
Christian Sheerer: In. Where are you guys?
Participant 2: Raleigh.
Christian Sheerer: Nice. Went to Duke, so I'm missing where you guys are at.
Participant 2: Did you say you went to Duke?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. Oh, okay.
Participant 1: Oh, geez, that's awesome.
Christian Sheerer: I know. I miss the 919.
Participant 2: We have a friend with us too.
Participant 1: Let me find my chair.
Christian Sheerer: Nice.
Participant 2: That's Bella. She comes to work every day.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. What does she do? She handling?
Participant 2: She hides under Brenda's feet all day.
Christian Sheerer: Nice. Okay, that's good.
Participant 1: He's on the rug.
Christian Sheerer: I think in the business you're in, you guys need an enforcer like that, too. Oh, well, it looks like you guys do pretty beautiful concrete. I love this. Okay, cool. But she's still a good enforcer or she's scared? Bella?
Participant 2: If her mom's here, she's an enforcer. If her mom's not here, she's just...
Participant 1: She has a brother that's an Akita and a sister that's a pit bull rescue, so... Oh, okay.
Christian Sheerer: Nice. Awesome. Akitas are beautiful too. Thank you. Cool. So now that we're all here, goal of today, I have a pretty good download from Zak, but I think first goal is always learn a little bit more about the business and how payments operate in your business. Second, in light of that, try to think through, okay, how might Nickel be able to improve on those processes or fit into the existing process? save you a little bit of time and money. Hopefully that's like what software can do. And then finally, maybe we play around in the platform, test some transactions out, and then we can set up a schedule for if you do think it is suitable for the ways that you guys take payments, pay out to vendors, then we can plan out like sort of like a rollout. Together. And that's my job. I don't think of it as something of like trying to get people to use it. It's just trying to get the most out of the software if it is useful. Does that sound good in terms of a plan for today?
Participant 1: Can I ask a quick question? Shelby signs me up for meetings. So is this something that would replace QuickBooks?
Christian Sheerer: No, it would replace QuickBooks payments. QuickBooks online. You guys have QuickBooks online.
Participant 1: Yes, we do.
Christian Sheerer: That's best in class ERP, right? ERP, I don't even know what it stands for, but it's accounting system. They do that very well. They do payments not as well, because what they focus on is the ERP. And sort of their idea, right, is like, if we can make money off of the payments because nobody's going to go away from us on the ERP. Like, why don't we just try to, you know, shed some or skim some money off the top when people are using us to run payments. So no, we integrate directly with QuickBooks and that means like there's a sink of information back and forth.
Participant 1: Gotcha.
Participant 2: I do want to share just upfront.
Christian Sheerer: In.
Participant 2: The space that we're in, a lot of things are done hard copy. So we get hard copy invoices, we send out hard copy checks, heard. So I know there's, what, a three percent fee for transactions or, or something like that I was reading. But we don't really do many, we don't really pay many people through QuickBooks. I think we pay, like, we pay.
Participant 1: Everybody two people via a credit card because we get cash back rewards. And we get a ton of cash back at the end of the year.
Christian Sheerer: Cool. Okay. So share more about that. Like, I guess we do it both sides, AR, receivable and AP. And so I guess since on the topic of being on AP when you guys pay people, what are you paying people for usually just in general, right? Materials, suppliers, I bet. And then there's other things that have to happen on the projects. And then what is that volume looking like and what's the process? You're getting an invoice from them and you're just paying them by a credit card. Walk me through that whole process.
Participant 2: So the whole process is.
Participant 1: Okay, so basically what we do is we We pay monthly.
Christian Sheerer: So.
Participant 1: Of course, our most expensive accounts payable is concrete. So we pay them monthly. We get all of our invoices in.
Christian Sheerer: And.
Participant 1: Again, they're all hard copy. Nothing comes to us via anyway, very, very few come via email. And then we're actually very antiquated. We then put them in OneDrive and then we put them in a folder in a little box and then my brother-in-law will then pay them at the like when it's time to pay the bills before they go late. So that's kind of I mean, we do it very I feel like we do very antiquated, but I don't know, you know, you don't know what you don't know.
Christian Sheerer: Right.
Participant 1: And we use a credit card to pay them. So, you know, we're again, very if.
Participant 2: We don't use a check.
Participant 1: Yeah, it's and we don't it's very rare that we use a check again, anybody who'll take the credit card, we put it on there.
Christian Sheerer: And then those that don't check, check. Cool. And your brother, okay, so brother, brother in law, sorry. that's what you said.
Participant 1: Yeah, but we all can do the billing if we want to. He's just anal about it.
Christian Sheerer: Why is that?
Participant 2: We won't get into it.
Participant 1: It's his control.
Participant 2: It's my husband.
Christian Sheerer: It's family business. All right, got you. Okay, so I I only ask just to get my head around the whole situation. So you get a hard copy of an invoice, and then you put it into OneDrive, you're scanning it.
Participant 2: We put it in QuickBooks first.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, QuickBooks and then OneDrive.
Participant 2: Yep. And you're right, we do scan it.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, and so this is happening on a monthly cadence and.
Participant 2: That'S done daily.
Participant 1: So anytime bills come in, they make sure that we're putting them on the right jobs. So they look at the bills and they approve them and make sure they're going to the right jobs. We then scan them into OneDrive into those jobs and then, and also put them in QuickBooks into those jobs under the vendors. And then we put them in a folder for Chad to pay when we pay bills.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, so then goes into, okay, so it's going into QuickBooks and into OneDrive.
Participant 2: Yes.
Christian Sheerer: And into this folder that's on OneDrive, I assume, and then.
Participant 2: Oh, no, it's hard copy.
Participant 1: Yeah, there's a voter on OneDrive.
Christian Sheerer: Oh, oh, oh, yeah.
Participant 1: In a little, in an actual, like, Manila folder in a box under each, again, very antiquated.
Christian Sheerer: You said it, not me.
Participant 1: It's all right, but, you know.
Christian Sheerer: I'm kidding. I'm kidding. No, no, no, this is, this is very typical in, in, in, in. these industries, right? That's sort of like where our founding story came from. We realized there was a lot of software being built for payments like Stripe, QuickBooks Payments, Bill.com, all these other things, right? But they weren't built specifically for industrial businesses, right? Who handle large amounts of payments, who require a high amount of security for those payments and a one-to-one, right? Like a lot of other payment softwares batch payments together. So they take, let's say at the end of the month, it's $100,000 that you need to pay out, and they pull all that money. And then after they pull the money, they try to sort it by invoice, right? What we do is create an individual payment link and invoice that can sync straight into QuickBooks so we can replace the process of OneDrive and you can keep it, right? But it'll happen in Nickel and then connect straight into QuickBooks automatically. And it's one-to-one. So when we pull funds for a $26,000 project or payable, right, on the AR or the AP side, that is for that one particular invoice with one particular payment link, which, as you can imagine, requires a lot of security assurance. So We do a lot of work with the banks so that you don't have to in making sure it's connected straight to one payment. So there's way, way lower risk of co-mingling funds or way, way lower risk of not connecting the right payment to the right invoice and then leaving money in the air. When you guys pay on the credit card, is it Do you guys have a fee on the credit card that you that you're absorbing?
Participant 1: Sometimes there'll be a small fee, but because we get so much in cash back, I mean, literally, we have a $200,000, $250,000 a month limit, and we paid off monthly. We earn a lot of cash back on that. And I know that we're not going to get away from that because we've looked at it monetarily and the amount that we might be paying a one percent fee to then get, you know, one and a half back. And when we're paying 220, 000 on a credit card, you know, it's, that's a lot of money that we're getting back. So I know that for that piece of it, we We're not, we're not going to come away from that. So, I mean, we pay everything we can on a credit card. Every single thing we can.
Participant 2: But some vendors don't even charge us a fee.
Participant 1: Yeah, some don't too.
Christian Sheerer: There's, they just, your, your credit card company isn't charging to transact on, on, no, no.
Participant 1: And we actually have two now. We are with Capital One and Chase. Capital One Spark doesn't charge any, just one annual fee. and then Chase has one annual fee and Chase actually has a higher cash back percentage than Capital One does. So no, they're not charging us any transaction fees, nothing, just that annual fee. And then we get our money at the end of the year or whenever we want, but we just will take a check and it's not taxed. It's not taxed because it's not considered, you know, taxable income. and it's just a way for us to earn a little bit extra money without being taxed on it, which is a huge issue.
Christian Sheerer: Cool. Okay. Awesome. All right. So the AP side is very clear to me. I'll walk, walk us through that on, on the platform. I think there's going to be. So there's two ways that we think about nickel is like APAR, but within those, it's like, yeah, can we save you money? But two, can we save you all this time that you're spending sort of. maneuvering between all of these different steps and sort of collapse those steps down from maybe four, as I'm seeing them now, into two, which would save you, I think, like quite a bit of time, which ultimately translates to money down the line. And if you could, would you pay out these invoices earlier or you still like doing them at one monthly cadence?
Participant 1: He doesn't always necessarily pay them all out. I'm going to give you an example. Say we owe five vendors. He doesn't always just say, oh, I'm going to pay this vendor. I'm going to go pay all five vendors today. We pay them whenever before we're at a 30 day late. Unfortunately, Chad, we have plenty of money to pay them, but he likes to wait till the very last minute to pay everybody. It's okay. It's just the way he is. But we don't always say, okay, we're just going to take today and now pay all of our bills.
Christian Sheerer: Gotcha.
Participant 1: Because he also works in the field and if this would make it easier, like Shelby and I would like to take this over from him just because he has so much going on.
Participant 2: He is against it, by the way.
Participant 1: Yeah, yeah. He's against us taking over anything like that has to do with billing, but.
Christian Sheerer: What does he, what else does he have going on?
Participant 1: He's in the field. Like, okay, yeah. They're also, they're also like, we have three superintendents, but they're also, these guys, our husbands sometimes are still in the.
Participant 2: Field because we just have too much work.
Participant 1: We just have a lot. Well, no, we don't have too much. That's never, we have, we're blessed with a lot of work.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. I was gonna say it's busy is, busy is good.
Participant 1: Yeah, busy is good.
Christian Sheerer: But they're in the field. They're, they're, okay. Yeah, I got you. okay. Yeah.
Participant 1: So if Chad wanted to do this, then how could he. How, what, what would that look like?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. And so then the, I think. So, yeah, so let's, let's, I'll show you that side. And then as we're, as we're going through it, we can chat through the AR side as well. So this is what it looks like when you get signed on and you have a couple transactions and you're tracking them, right? This is a fake environment, right? Because it's not actual monies. But over time, you'll have transactions able to be viewed in the summary over the past 30 days, right? C receivable, C payables. Payables is bill pay, right? I'm paying a bill out. And I can load in my vendor's information. So I can just quick direct to them. If they're sending me an invoice, so let's say they send me an invoice and I put it into QuickBooks, rather than having to then put it into OneDrive and folder and that Manila folder, this green little dot here because I've connected to my QuickBooks in Nickel is pulling that invoice already and pulling vendor information that you've put into QuickBooks.
Participant 1: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: Meaning I put it into QuickBooks, a new vendor comes in, it's that now automatically in Nickel in the same minute.
Participant 1: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: And so then when I go and pay bills, they might send me one again. Okay, so Armanino has sent me one for $120. I'll go in and then I can go and make that payment. I can set it up.
Participant 1: Can you, but you can't do it via credit card.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, you can.
Participant 1: Oh, okay. So to pay bills, all he has to do is, and here's a question. How, how does nickel differentiate? Because again, we have concrete invoices coming in all the time. You know, we may have 40 invoices, but only 20 of them need paid. How does nickel differentiate what needs paid right now before it's considered like late, like past 30 days. Does it have that ability?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, it'll track the due date right here.
Participant 1: So once we, but we keep one drive just so we have backup and record of them.
Christian Sheerer: And so backup meaning.
Participant 1: So if we want to go look at a job, because we put everything into WonderDrive under job numbers. So if we want to go look at a job and say, okay, basically to see what did we spend on a job, what do we make on a job, we keep a spreadsheet.
Participant 2: Even like the tax stuff we have to do, we have to go in.
Participant 1: And pull some things. Yeah, because some things we'll have to pull certain invoices because certain jobs will pay us back the tax that we paid. So we have to do So we just keep it there so we know, okay, how much concrete was poured on this job? You know, we can look at all the different vendors in OneDrive. So I don't think this is going to take the OneDrive step away from us.
Christian Sheerer: Okay.
Participant 1: But it may make it easier for Chad to pay, but that's what I'm trying to figure out.
Christian Sheerer: And so what is, I mean, I'm familiar with OneDrive. Because as just a, as just a.
Participant 2: Like, the OneDrive actually is holistic for the entire company. It goes from employee information to projects that break down by invoices, vendors to, oh, God. What am I thinking? Insurance. Everything that goes with our business, OneDrive contains everything.
Participant 1: So if we ever need to go back, and we really are keeping it for accounting purposes too, because if the IRS ever comes in and says, I want to see all this stuff, all we have to do is go to that job and they can look and do, and look at anything that they need to see.
Christian Sheerer: Is that stuff also double populated in QuickBooks? like I, I'm familiar with QuickBooks to a certain degree and I, to the degree that I am, they can track by job, vendor. Yeah.
Participant 2: When we pull reports, we'll pull it by project number.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah.
Participant 1: QuickBooks can do that as well.
Participant 2: But I think it's limited because we're not able to do everything that we need to do.
Participant 1: Yeah. That that job can, not everything in the job that we put in there.
Participant 2: Is In QuickBooks, there's contracts that go in there. There's billing and pay apps that go in there. Everything under that project is broken down, the project's broken down into different categories, and everything is saved under that project. So vendors is just one of the things.
Christian Sheerer: Okay. Yeah. And so rather than, I guess, conceptualizing it as a replacement of OneDrive, It would just, you put it into OneDrive because that's such an integral part of your business, but it would replace you having to go into OneDrive to make a payment or to receive a payment.
Participant 1: Yeah, we don't do, really, honestly, OneDrive is just, we don't do anything out of OneDrive like that. OneDrive, honestly, is just instead of us putting it in folders, even though we do it too, folders here in our office and bank boxes, OneDrive is like that. That's what OneDrive is. It's basically a place that we store stuff. So we don't make payments in and out of there. It's just really a storage. It's backup for backup.
Christian Sheerer: Cool.
Participant 1: Is what it is. So nothing.
Christian Sheerer: It's sort of separate. Yeah, it's sort of separate.
Participant 1: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. And so then, yeah, then I think, like, then I think this is rather than a manual process of making the payment after your, so when, so when Chad has to go and make a payment, is he going into OneDrive first or is he going into QuickBooks.
Participant 1: He goes into his box and then goes into QuickBooks.
Christian Sheerer: Okay.
Participant 1: He has a box with folders in it. We'll use one of our vendors. We just say like Chandler Concrete or Concrete Supply. I'll open up that concrete supply folder. He'll look, he says, okay, I'm going to pay all these invoices. He verifies the invoices are correct. He checks them as paid in QuickBooks and then he pays them via the credit card and then we put them in a folder, in an actual real folder that says pay.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, exactly.
Participant 2: Until they clear the account and then they go in our filing cabinet.
Christian Sheerer: Okay. Okay. So I think that is what gets collapsed into one step, right? That stuff is already in QuickBooks, right? As soon as the invoice comes in, that'll be live in in QuickBooks right away. and we can still track if it's paid outside nickel. We can still track if it's paid in full. Because once it gets, if it's paid via nickel, cool. Boom. It's like thrown into QuickBooks. And then this is where we get that status update. And if it's paid in nickel, boom. All right, we've paid it in full. We've seen ones that are queued up for payment at the end of the month or whatever. So if Chad wants to, every week he can go in. and see, or as soon as an invoice comes in and it's put into QuickBooks, he can come into Nickel and pay that bill. Right. So that time goes down the amount that he has to spend checking and verifying in QuickBooks and checking it off in QuickBooks. Right. Because if he's passing it through Nickel, then it'll just be checked off in QuickBooks and in Nickel at the same time. And then the only other step that he has to take is the one that you guys, which is a unique to to you is that extra backup that you guys do, which is not.
Participant 1: Extra, it's just per transaction you pay or is it a monthly fee or yearly fee?
Christian Sheerer: What do you mean?
Participant 1: For your software?
Christian Sheerer: Oh, oh, oh, oh. It is a monthly fee of $35.
Participant 1: Okay. with unlimited transactions.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, we have, we handle people who do, I would say unlimited to if you're doing like 30, 000 transactions a month, we have to. Exactly. Yeah. We have to have a conversation if you're really at the high end about, like, what our service means then, because there's a little bit more, like, engineering database handling that we have to do. But for the gap, for the volume that you guys are. yeah, unlimited, you wouldn't tip the wires on that at all.
Participant 1: Is there something that Shelby and I can, like, I'm assuming you could send us something like is where we can kind of go in and it shows like a test thing or maybe not a test, but what people can see where they go in and say, okay, you can click this, this does this.
Christian Sheerer: Bella. Yeah, we're doing it right now. What would you like to see? And then after this, I could set you up with a free trial. So we don't do a fake environment. We could set you up with a free trial and then we can check in after you've run some transactions and troubleshoot there. But I know we have four minutes. If we go over a little bit, is that okay? Or you guys have a hard stop at the 30-minute mark? Yeah.
Participant 1: Go ahead and then I'll let you know because I may have a call. I have to see if it comes through, but go ahead.
Christian Sheerer: That's no worries. I'll check in at 10:30. Because we could also set up some other time to go into specific stuff after you guys get on the free trial. But what were you looking to see? So we've gone through paying out bills. If I come in, I see a bill, I want to make the payment.
Participant 1: What if he wants to pay more than one bill at a time?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, I can click all of them.
Participant 1: Okay, or you can go and check the ones that you actually want to pay.
Christian Sheerer: Mm-. Yeah, I can skip some.
Participant 1: Yeah. I mean, I, yeah, I think we'll just have to talk to Chad about it. Um, because.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. No, no, no. It sounds like, I mean, I've already made a note on my little paper here. It sounds like we have to get his, buy-in for it. I'm, I've been doing this long enough to know that it's, you know, it's a team effort every single time. I think the nice thing is like, I've sold software that, I would tell people, hey, you guys need four weeks to implement. Nickel, you could turn on in a day and start running transactions, especially because it'll pull in your existing QuickBooks stuff that if stuff is already in QuickBooks and you integrate Nickel in QuickBooks, that stuff will just pull in. So that time to implement really goes down to like an hour. When you guys get paid, just so I'm aware before we hop off though, how do you guys get paid? So I'm understanding on the AP side, I think I know where we fit in there, but on the AR side when you send invoices to clients, how does that work?
Participant 1: Hard check.
Christian Sheerer: Always check.
Participant 1: Yes. Maybe one or two ACHs, but it's very rare.
Christian Sheerer: And how many checks are you guys throwing around every month?
Participant 2: Depends how many projects we have.
Participant 1: Yeah, it depends on if they're billing and if they decide to pay that month. And yeah.
Christian Sheerer: On average?
Participant 1: On average, what would you say, shall we 10?
Christian Sheerer: Probably.
Participant 1: But they're large amounts.
Christian Sheerer: What does that amount look like?
Participant 1: Some are like, what was the last one, 120. It just depends, like it just depends on what we built.
Participant 2: Like, 40,000 to 250,000.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah.
Participant 1: Or when, and then we had a million dollar check a year ago. Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: Okay. Yeah, we do that. That's, that's easy for us. That's not, People are surprised when they say, Hey, we run really big transactions. And we're like, we do too. It's like we've had, you know, we had a couple ones this month, this week that were upwards 300, 400,000, not to get any details about who it was, but that's what we were built for. If you're going regularly over a million, then we have a conversation because that again requires a little bit more attention from our side. about pricing. So the pricing might be a little bit different if you're doing transactions over a million than $35 a month, because there's more tension on our side, there's more time invested in engineering database handling of it and our relationship with the bank. But from $25,000 to $1,000,000 transactions, that's what we built Nickel for, because no other software vendors are built for that. Right. And can do it on a free ACH basis. Or even offer credit card transactions of that size or debit card transactions of that size to your customers in one spot. Right. Which is why we run into a lot of surprises about like, hey, we run this on check all the time. But, you know, a lot of times people, our biggest customer, for example, or one of them, Chicago brass was doing everything on check. large transactions of that nature too, and then moved over and they saved about 15 hours a month. Just not having to drive checks back and forth, not having to deal with direct owners of the customers that they're dealing with because somebody on a payable team at a customer shop could have, you know, access to an accounting account and routing number that they wouldn't have access to, like actually write and sign a check. So the time frame that it took to get paid went down in the time frame that it took to reconcile, it went down as well. And so I think that's the most interesting thing for me is like, how do we get you guys less busy in the administrative work? Like let's just let software do what software can do, and then you guys get to focus on spending more time Finding new clients and being, maybe you guys not in the field, I guess, if you're not doing that, but everybody gets to get back into the field. Yeah.
Participant 1: Well, I think what we'll do is we'll, hey, you know what? Thank you so much. I think I'm gonna, I've gotta grab this call.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, no, no, of course.
Participant 2: And then we'll talk to Chad.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, Shelby.
Participant 2: Follow up with us, Christian.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, let's, let's, let's, do you, do you think Chad would wanna get on a conversation, chat through his process more specifically?
Participant 2: That's a good question. I can't tell you that until I ask him because he's very finicky.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, no worries. So let's do this. Do you guys want to get on the platform with that free trial and just test out a couple transactions? I say test because some people are more comfortable doing some $1, $10 transactions.
Participant 2: That just- no, I don't want to put anything on top of QuickBooks right now.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, so you can run real transactions if you'd like to.
Participant 2: Yeah, no, I'm not until I would we would decide if it's something we want to do or not.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, so then what I think stands in the way of deciding that so that we can help game plan around that.
Participant 2: Well, one, I don't want to do it without having Chad's buy-in and two, if I'm looking at you, I was in vendor management, so if I'm looking at you, I'm going to start looking at other vendors too. So I want to see what other people have to offer before there would be any kind of decision making or any kind of testing or 30 day trial.
Christian Sheerer: Cool. Awesome. Yeah, we would expect that and we're confident in that. So. That's what you should do. So then let's do this. Let's schedule some time. Do you think that there's a time that we could have a placeholder that you could invite Chad onto and if we need to reschedule it, then that's okay. But just so I have you on the calendar in the case that I get booked up and so I have you guys to be able to be prioritized.
Participant 2: Yeah, I can tell you Mornings wouldn't work for Chad has to get jobs running and Brenda and I only work till two or three and only three days a week Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, so that gives you a little.
Participant 2: Bit of and we take lunch every.
Christian Sheerer: Day. You guys are doing. You're living the dream. So. Okay, I think let's try for next week. I know it's Monday is the holiday. Let's try for a week from now, like, before. Right before or after lunch. Is he in the field in the middle of the day? Like, around that one to two time frame?
Participant 2: It depends. It depends.
Christian Sheerer: What about Wednesday? Do you know? Next Wednesday?
Participant 2: Never know what's gonna happen till the night before.
Christian Sheerer: Till the night before. Okay, so let's make a placeholder for next Wednesday so that we can break this down with Chad and chat through his process a little bit more.
Participant 2: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: I will make a note to reach out to you Tuesday to figure out if that's going to be a good time that we can keep. And I'd love to have you on there just because of the context that you shared. But if we need to be more flexible around Chad's timeline to get him acquainted with it, then we can do it individually and then we can push everybody back together and have like a one big conversation. I think I'll be able to show him everything in around 30 to 40 minutes. So I think that's what I would shoot for. So I put it on.
Participant 2: Why don't you do it at like two o'clock?
Christian Sheerer: Two o'clock? yeah, you're still be good if even though you're off after two.
Participant 2: Well, we leave between two and three, so as long as we're done by three.
Christian Sheerer: Awesome. Yeah, we'll be done by three. And I'm just gonna book it for 45 minutes just in case we need that time, but we will likely probably give some of that time back.
Participant 2: Include Chad on the invite. I'll give you his email address. tell me when you're ready.
Christian Sheerer: One sec. Okay, I'm ready.
Participant 2: It's just Chad at mm-concrete.com.
Christian Sheerer: Cool. And then I got Shelby McCoy. And is that sufficient in terms of invites?
Participant 2: Brenda. Include Brenda.
Christian Sheerer: She's Brenda at MM-concrete Brenda.mondoc M-O-N-D-O-K okay.
Participant 2: At mm-concrete.com got it okay.
Christian Sheerer: Okay I've sent out that invite I will also send out a recap of our meeting I'll try to highlight the things that are most relevant for what we chatted about today plus what I think We could give Chad a quick download before we get on the call with him. And I will check in, I'll make a note on my calendar to check in on Tuesday because everything is aware. We're aware of what's going on tomorrow, the night before, which is cool. And I will also drop you my number in the case that you have any questions. And I'll give you an email on Tuesday.
Participant 2: Okay, sounds good, Christian. Thank you.
Christian Sheerer: Thank you. Yeah. And really appreciate the time and all the context that you guys shared. I think it'll be a good fit. I think that we just need to go through your guys' standard process. And then after that conversation, if you speak to a couple of other vendors, we can break down the differences more specifically based on the ones that you're looking at. But we're confident in our solution. So yeah. And so I'll see you on Wednesday and you guys have a good weekend and have a good labor day.
Participant 2: Yeah, you too. Thank you.
Christian Sheerer: Thank you.
Participant 2: Bye.
Christian Sheerer: Bye.
