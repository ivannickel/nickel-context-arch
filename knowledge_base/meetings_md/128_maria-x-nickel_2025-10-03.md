Maria Paula Manrique: Hey, Jacob. Good morning.
Jacob Greenberg: Hi, Maria.
Maria Paula Manrique: Hey, Jacob. How are you doing?
Jacob Greenberg: Good, how are you?
Maria Paula Manrique: I'm doing great. I'm doing great. How's everything going?
Jacob Greenberg: Great. I'm so sorry for running a bit late here. My other meeting went over.
Maria Paula Manrique: No, it's okay. No problem at all.
Jacob Greenberg: So, yeah, I wanted to check in and see how everything's going with Butterfrait. I have half an hour if that works for you.
Maria Paula Manrique: Yeah, yeah, it's perfect. Well, I don't think we're gonna take that long. Okay. So far everything's going great. I already use nickel and it's really smooth and easy to use. Sorry, I think I have some questions. When I make a payment, then you can add the email of the person that you receive. Well, the receipt of the payment, right?
Jacob Greenberg: Yes. Yeah.
Maria Paula Manrique: Is there a way for me to see the emails that are being sent from Nico?
Jacob Greenberg: That's a great question. What would be. What. What would you like to see specifically? Like what. What would be the purpose of seeing the emails that are going out? Just to like.
Maria Paula Manrique: Like to be sure that they are receiving the emails and also to see. I'm not so sure. I completely forgot what are they seeing? So I want to confirm. I wanted to confirm with one email, one payment that I completed, if the information that was sent through the email was what they requested or if I was missing to send something else. So if it was better for me to send a drafted email, but from the Gmail.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, let me. Give me one second. Let me find out if there's a way we could access that. I'm not familiar with it, so let me.
Maria Paula Manrique: Okay. Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: All right, Maria, I have a solution for you.
Maria Paula Manrique: Awesome.
Jacob Greenberg: So what we can do is there is a setting. I'm going to show you how to access it now inside nickel that allows you to CC like yourself on every email that goes out so that me make sure I get the place. All right. Do you see my screen here, Maria?
Maria Paula Manrique: Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: So you pop into settings here, go to notifications, and under merchant notifications, this one on the bottom, Contact email. You toggle this on and you can add your own email here so that whenever an email is sent out, that email will be cc'd.
Maria Paula Manrique: Oh, that's perfect. Okay, perfect. Will that fix this? And so I know that to schedule payments here using nickel, I will have to pay more. I will have to pay. I don't remember how much, but it's part of the plans that you have. I think it is nickel plus, right? So it would.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, nickel plus. It's. It's 45amonth if you pay monthly, or it's 35amonth if you pay one year up front.
Maria Paula Manrique: Okay. Then when I was using only QuickBooks to schedule payment for someone, I couldn't schedule the payment that. But I was doing it through QuickBooks, not through nickel. That was the reason why. Right, because it's already integrated.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, exactly. Okay, you're saying when you were using QuickBooks you were not able to schle the payment in advance?
Maria Paula Manrique: Yeah, and I don't know. Well, because Quick QuickBooks offers that. Offers that in general, you can schedule the payment so you can proceed with it without any trouble. But then I received a failure there. So I'm guessing that it was related to the integration that we have with you guys.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. Yeah. So if you're sending it out from nickel to be able to schedule in advance, you would need to sign up for Nickel plus.
Maria Paula Manrique: Okay. Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: And there's some other great benefits that you get with it too. So if you do sign up for just 35amonth beyond the scheduling in advance, your turnaround times are going to be faster. So it's a two day turnaround with ach, next day turnaround credit card. I know you guys are currently growing. Once you guys hit a volume where you're going to be doing more than $25,000 per transaction, you'll be able to do that easily with nickel. You'll also be able to do other other things like adding more members, more membership controls, et cetera, et cetera.
Maria Paula Manrique: And it's, it's cool. Yeah. Because it's better if maybe we can transfer faster also the ACH transactions. Okay. And then the other thing I saw and I wanted to confirm related to the integration, when I create or when I receive a bill in QuickBooks. And I already reviewed the bill and it's already in unpaid. I'm not seeing in QuickBooks the bill in unpaid, but I'm seeing the bill in nickel.
Jacob Greenberg: Say that one more time. So when you create the Invoice from within QuickBooks.
Maria Paula Manrique: Yeah, yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: Everything from nickel, you've already.
Maria Paula Manrique: Yeah. And then. Yeah, the bill, it's already in QuickBooks. The bill that I have to pay. So it should show the bill. It should be showing me the bill in unpaid, in the section of the unpaid bills, but in QuickBooks. So I don't know if it is related to the integration. And I wanted to confirm that I'm not seeing the bills that I have to pay in QuickBooks, I'm only seeing the bills in nickel.
Jacob Greenberg: Oh, that's interesting.
Maria Paula Manrique: Is that related? Yeah. Yeah. And I wanted to confirm if it's that related to the integration.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, I am. I haven't heard that before, so I don't think it's an integration.
Maria Paula Manrique: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: Usually it's a two way sync automatically. So what happens? So you, you're cre. Walk me through one more time. You're creating the invoice within QuickBooks.
Maria Paula Manrique: Yeah, sending it out.
Jacob Greenberg: You sync to nickel, you send it out through nickel. Then when you go back into QuickBooks, you don't see that invoice at all until it's been paid.
Maria Paula Manrique: I don't see the, the invoice in the unpaid fields. In QuickBooks. I'm saying that only in Nico.
Jacob Greenberg: Oh, maybe the section that you're looking in is like for accounts payable bills, not accounts receivable.
Maria Paula Manrique: Yeah, for the payables.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha.
Maria Paula Manrique: Okay. Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: So if you're making an invoice for a customer, should be in the receivable section.
Maria Paula Manrique: Okay. Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: But if you did want to send me some screenshots at some point, I'd be happy to.
Maria Paula Manrique: I. I think I can show you here really quick.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, great. I might not have a technical answer to you at the moment, but I could take a look and I could pass it to my team. There's been anything like this internally? I just noticed not sure.
Maria Paula Manrique: Okay. For example, let me send the screenshot. I think it's easier. So if I'm hearing QuickBooks. Okay. This is what you can see in QuickBooks for the bills that you have to pay, you can see that there are for review, unpaid and paid. So for review are not never going to show in nickel because, well, they're still under review.
Jacob Greenberg: Have you been using for accounts payable or for accounts receivable? For charging?
Maria Paula Manrique: For both.
Jacob Greenberg: For both.
Maria Paula Manrique: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. So yeah, in the part of the unpaid bills, then nothing is showing there in QuickBooks, but then I can see the unpaid bills in nickel, so it's cool. I still can make the payment, but I need to confirm that was the reason why.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay. I've never seen that. So let me find out for you.
Maria Paula Manrique: Okay, thank you. And the other question I had is that I kind of forgot the portal that Nicole has. So the client can go inside the portal and see their payments. Can you remind me that I, I. Yeah, go.
Jacob Greenberg: Go into platform and click on invoices.
Maria Paula Manrique: Invoices.
Jacob Greenberg: And then on the top of that page there should be a sentence that says the word payment portal. It should be like pink.
Maria Paula Manrique: Oh, yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: Click that button.
Maria Paula Manrique: Okay. Okay. Okay. So if I send this link to the client, they should be able to add the payment amount and the reason for payment.
Jacob Greenberg: Yep.
Maria Paula Manrique: Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay, perfect.
Jacob Greenberg: Most of our customers use that link by putting it on their website. Like a pay invoice button on their website.
Maria Paula Manrique: Okay, so, well, am I the only one able to use that link?
Jacob Greenberg: No, no. So here, let me share my screen.
Maria Paula Manrique: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: So this payments link right here, we'll have customers like the payments button up top on their website. So it's more, it's not for unique invoices. It's more for like a generic payment option.
Maria Paula Manrique: Okay, so I cannot. That. Okay, no, wait, wait. I got confused. I don't know what this is for the customer so they can use it or this is for me so I can add this in my website and then the client can go there and click and make the payment for us.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, exactly. So you can take this link, you can put it on your website or however you want to use it, and it just makes it easy for your customer to make a payment to you.
Maria Paula Manrique: Oh, okay.
Jacob Greenberg: But it doesn't have anything specific about the payment. Like this invoice might, right? Like this would be a unique invoice. Yeah, yeah.
Maria Paula Manrique: Okay. Okay. Okay, gotcha. Then I have another question. So I have a client that prefers to make the payments on her end. So she don't want to, doesn't want to add her bank account information here. She just wants to have maybe a portal where she can go and select the invoice she wants to pay and make the payment. Is there an option for you guys? So I can maybe share that with her and she can make the payment on her end by selecting the invoice.
Jacob Greenberg: So once she's already been sent a couple invoices. Correct? Like more than one?
Maria Paula Manrique: Yeah, I have, I, I have seven invoices already here, also in nickel. But I don't want to send her seven emails because it's. The email that she has is related also with her operation. So I'm pretty sure that the invoice are going to get lost in her email.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. Yeah, I think you would have to send out each individually. Let me double check it. Hey, Maria, I'm going to find out. Because what I'm going to find out is if you generate an invoice, like five or six of them and only send out one via email, once you send multiple invoices to the same person, she should be able to see all of those invoices on any one of the invoices that you send. So let me share my screen again. So if I send out this invoice, for example, and I've already sent a previous invoice, it should show underneath here. It'll show up and you could click and go into the other invoice. I want to see if you, you just don't want to have to send out seven different emails to them. You just want to send one and have them be able to see all the different voices. So I'm going to see if that is something that we can turn on, but it's going to take me a little bit of time and I'll send you a follow up email.
Maria Paula Manrique: Okay? Okay. No, that's fine. Well, it would be great because there are some systems that the clients can, where the clients can just only click their customer profile and then they can make the payments that are missing to be paid for us. But then for the ones that the system that we had is charging, like something that makes no sense at all, it has fees for even the ACH transactions that no one has. So yeah, I cannot use that system. But I know that there are systems just that I don't, I don't recall them.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, so I actually just had my, my development team just messaged me back. If you do have this customer and they have several different invoices, you should be able to just send out one invoice and the link, let's see, no transactions here. The link should be on any one of the individual invoices. So if I create five invoices, for example, for this customer here, and then I only sent out one invoice via email, when they log in, they'll see that one invoice populated first, but they'll also see a list of all the other invoices beneath it as well.
Maria Paula Manrique: Okay, perfect.
Jacob Greenberg: And now that you're seeing yourself on the outbound emails, you should see what they were also.
Maria Paula Manrique: Okay, okay, that's perfect. Okay, let me try to do that and I'll guide her. Okay, okay, perfect. And going to another last thing and I saw maybe at the beginning of the integration that there was a place that says something like to save your client's information, you have to have the plus, the nickel plus. Is that correct?
Jacob Greenberg: If you want to save your client's information for the bank account information.
Maria Paula Manrique: Yeah. To withdraw the funds automatically from their account.
Jacob Greenberg: Let me see.
Maria Paula Manrique: Okay, so far I believe you should.
Jacob Greenberg: You should be able to do that on nickel, on the normal, right?
Maria Paula Manrique: Okay, okay, okay, got you.
Jacob Greenberg: So this, for example, is what I was saying. Before this will show.
Maria Paula Manrique: Can I take a screenshot of that?
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah.
Maria Paula Manrique: Okay. Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: Let me figure this out for you.
Maria Paula Manrique: Okay, perfect. Okay, perfect. Because I can send her these, the screenshot, so she will understand. Okay, perfect. Well, I think these were all the questions that I had. Maybe I'm thinking that we're gonna go for the nickel plus, but to make the ECH transactions faster. But maybe not right now. But still. Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: Well, let me know if you decide to make the transition and if you need any support along the way.
Maria Paula Manrique: Okay, perfect. Well, thank you so much, Jacob, for helping me with all these questions.
Jacob Greenberg: Happy to help, Maria.
Maria Paula Manrique: Thank you. Happy Friday. Have a great day. Bye.
