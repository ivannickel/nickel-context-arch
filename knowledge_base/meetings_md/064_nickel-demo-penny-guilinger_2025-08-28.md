Christian Sheerer: She was great. But yeah, I mean, we can get right into it. You still good for the 30 minutes?
Penny Guilinger: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: Awesome. Awesome. Okay, so yeah, tell me a little bit more about Galvin and what you guys are doing on the payment side, AR and AP, and where you think we can step in.
Penny Guilinger: Yeah. So we are, we're a Salesforce consulting partner. do a lot of like cloud based solutions for our clients. We use QuickBooks and I think I read that you guys integrate with QuickBooks. Okay, so our my struggle has been so I'm remote. I mean our whole company is remote, but we're based out of Indianapolis and I live in Orlando and so my boss has been going in every week to do the checks. and I've been trying to for a very long time, try to find some solution that will work to where we can accept ACH. We do have clients that they can set up, you know, whether they use bill.com or some other platform to where they send us the money via ACH, like we just can't do it on our end. But I want to be able to have or let our clients have the option of like we send them the QuickBooks invoice. and then they're able to pay it, whether they want to use, you know, a credit card or via ACH. The only thing is, like, we don't want to pay any fees, so I don't know if that's, like, something where we can pass it on. I tried to do the QuickBooks. However, they were asking for some, like, personal information, and my boss that is about to kind of retire in about a year or so wasn't comfortable, like, going through with all of that. So I ended up just canceling like our application. And so I've been trying to find, I just honestly found you on Google, never heard of you before. So I was like, well, let me see, you know what? If it'll work or I don't know. So just kind of searching some options because I would like for our clients to be able to pay ACH so we can limit the amount of checks because they get lost, they take too long. Um, and I know we have a lot of clients that are like, oh, can we pay credit card or do you have an online option? And I'm like, not yet, but I'm trying. So if it's something that, you know, is feasible, like price wise that we can do, then I think like the owners would be open to it. So, yeah. And so you guys have QuickBooks online.
Christian Sheerer: As your accounting software? We do, yes. Okay, cool.
Penny Guilinger: Awesome.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, we link up to them directly.
Penny Guilinger: Is it as like simple as like, I mean, I don't really know how that works, but like, would the pay option be on the invoice. So like say I sent somebody an invoice and then they can just pay it from there or do we have to send them an invoice a different way?
Christian Sheerer: Either way, up to you.
Penny Guilinger: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: The, so you guys already use QuickBooks?
Penny Guilinger: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: So what was this situation which you guys tried to get onto QuickBooks Pay and you didn't want to do that?
Penny Guilinger: It was through Intuit. So I guess it's, I mean it's QuickBooks but Intuit it's like its own different thing. And so kind of like anything else, you have to do like an application process. They have to kind of approve you, but they were asking for more of like the personal things rather than like the business things. And my boss was just like, I don't want to provide that. And so we just didn't move forward. So I don't know if you guys I don't know if you guys asked for stuff to get set up.
Christian Sheerer: Well, we have to link to a bank account, right, to be able to pull money.
Penny Guilinger: Well, and that's like the business bank account where it's like, okay, so we can give you, like, our business bank accounts, but, like, they wanted, like, like, you know, his personal accounts and, like, utility bills and, like, all this other stuff. And he just was like, why do I need that?
Christian Sheerer: And, yeah, it's a little bit of a mess.
Penny Guilinger: You do?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah.
Penny Guilinger: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: I mean, we need to link to the business bank account, obviously. Right. To be able to pull money from it. Okay. So, yeah, I see. I see the difference there. And so yeah, we still link up to... So QuickBooks, yeah, they're owned by Intuit. They got bought out. I don't remember when it was, but Intuit is this huge company. QuickBooks is one of their products. And so you would still use QuickBooks Online as the accounting tool. Very simple. You can make an invoice in QuickBooks and then it'll appear in Nickel so that you can just send out the payment. And we send payment links to people so that then they'll go in and I can show you. and pay out either way. What are the typical invoices like? Like how many of them and what's their amount usually?
Penny Guilinger: So I invoice every two weeks, probably, I mean, over 50 plus invoices, anywhere from like probably 300,000 and up, like for every two weeks.
Christian Sheerer: Oh, oh, oh, not per.
Penny Guilinger: Yeah, not per, but like it's like total like it's over like 300,000 at least.
Christian Sheerer: I got you, I got you. Okay.
Penny Guilinger: So it's like some invoices could be $300 and then I have an invoice that's like 16,000.
Christian Sheerer: Is that the highest one?
Penny Guilinger: No, I've seen like 20, 24, 25, but then sometimes if a client wants to like prepay like a set of hours, like I've sent an invoice for 90,000. okay. But yeah, nothing over like an individual invoice. Like I haven't seen anything over like 90.
Christian Sheerer: Cool. Yeah, that's, that's so the story behind nickel and the reason we're able to do ACH for free is because we work with a lot of reputable businesses who do large transactions. Right. And that's sort of where we found our footing is in industrial businesses, people who are doing material suppliers and stuff. And then there's a lot of companies who do like software stuff like you who use us and take advantage of the free ACH and just like the payment options on credit card, et cetera, passing that fee on to your customers without tripping over any wires about surcharging laws in different states because we built out this infrastructure that was like, you know, we deal with a lot of construction companies who's like a $90,000 is like small, right? And so for different businesses, that's like larger or smaller, right? And so we can handle all those free ACH or on credit. smoothly. And so that's where I sort of get into the question of like, what is that typical volume looking like just depending on how we're going to interact with y'all? And so when you come in and you go into nickel, you'll just first thing you'll do. And so I'm in a little bit of a different part of it. The first thing you'll do is you'll go into your account settings and just set up the integration with QuickBooks.
Penny Guilinger: So that's something like I could just do myself.
Christian Sheerer: Oh, yeah, I've. So I've been selling software and helping people get started with it for a while. And at another company I used to work for, we would tell them, hey, you guys need. And it's just, like, a more robust, different type of software. We would say, hey, you guys need, like, four weeks to implement this. It, Nicole, you could do this today, honestly. And that's probably what, you know, by the end of the call, hopefully we get you familiar enough with, like, a little bit of the platform so that you could get set up. today or tomorrow and start running transactions.
Penny Guilinger: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: So yeah, you could do this. You'd probably need banking account information that you might have, right?
Penny Guilinger: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: To be able to input that stuff in. But yeah, you could do this right away provided that you have, you know, the login to QuickBooks. And so then when I'm logged into QuickBooks, if I'm creating an invoice in QuickBooks, That stuff will just pull over into here.
Penny Guilinger: Right?
Christian Sheerer: So it's two way. So if I create an invoice in QuickBooks, it'll pull into nickel and you can send it out via nickel where I can go in and send or I can send a new invoice, create one in nickel, and then it'll link up to QuickBooks.
Penny Guilinger: Right?
Christian Sheerer: Vice versa. So you can do both. And so I could go into somebody and I say, this is for hours.
Penny Guilinger: Of.
Christian Sheerer: Salesforce set up and I say whatever the amount is 90,000. And you could do recurring if you have those recurring or you could do the one time, right? If they're doing it up front, up to you, you can track them both. Say when the due date is, whether it's in the future, or right now, you can upload a document, maybe their contract with you, or if you're creating it in nickel, maybe that, you know, one that you have in QuickBooks already, I'll create it and then I'll send them a secure payment link. So it's one to one, right? So then I'll send out a link to my customer and I already have his information on file. That's me. So, like, this is my fake account called to grow distribution, and I'll send myself this link. and I'm the customer in this world. And so I'll go to my email and I see, okay, cool. Colton or Penny from Galvin sent me this payment request. I gotta go in and this is what the bill is for and pay it out this way.
Penny Guilinger: So now if we have a question, if we have, like, 'cause we have not a lot, but like a couple, like every quarter that are like a recurring invoice for like sixth grade or whatever, will that also sync up or is that I mean, I guess because we have it auto recurring. So it's like, okay, January one, they get one and then again in April, but that'll obviously sync all over.
Christian Sheerer: So, yeah, yeah. And so it'll sync all those live ones that you have that are active or scheduled. When you say auto, do you automatically pull their funds? Like, do you get their information?
Penny Guilinger: No, I mean, like auto, the invoice auto sends. So that way I just have it set up so that like January 1st or whatever, like they'll get an invoice for $6,000 and then come April 1st, they'll get another invoice for $6,000. But no, not yet. We don't pull any, we don't know how to pull anybody's funds that way.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, so cool. So to answer your question on the auto recurring, yeah, I showed you an individual one, but I could go in and, you know, I could edit this invoice. and the number amount, or I can go in and make a new one, right, of the 6,000. So let's do Chris 9, a different customer, same email. But, you know, it's another customer and I'll say recurring quarterly payment, 6,000. And if you're making this in QuickBooks, it'll sync. All right. But I'm just showing you how to do it in QuickBooks just because I don't have a QuickBooks. Scout. And if you're doing it in nickel, it'll sync to quick posts, too.
Penny Guilinger: Right.
Christian Sheerer: So same thing. And I can do every quarter, start.
Penny Guilinger: On.
Christian Sheerer: Quarter four is October and then end on, I don't know, however long you guys do it. And then you'll see, okay, cool. October 1st, January 1st, April 1st, Etc.
Penny Guilinger: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: And then I'll create it. And the reason I asked about pulling funds is you could send them an authorization through Nickel, maybe down the line for those customers that you have a lot of trust with, and just pull funds from their payment method that they give you. Or if you're doing it in the way where you send it every quarter, they're going to get this, or sorry, I'll send it to myself again. They're going to get that one and they'll have all of the details there. Right, where they go in and see, okay, cool, this is a recurring quarterly payment. They're gonna get that notification. They could pay the first one by a card, pay the second one by ACH, what have you. And as you'll see, like that fee is getting pushed onto them. People typically okay with paying the fees because they get all the benefits from having a credit card transaction, right, all the points, whatever.
Penny Guilinger: Huh, interesting. And so what is the cost for us to use like that, this platform?
Christian Sheerer: 35 bucks a month.
Penny Guilinger: That's it. Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: If you make payments.
Penny Guilinger: There's no limits, like whether we bill, you know, a million dollars or five dollars, like there's no limit to no.
Christian Sheerer: And if you do over a million dollars, then we have to have a conversation about.
Penny Guilinger: I don't think I want invoice, but, yeah, people do.
Christian Sheerer: Oh, no, no, no. Yeah, it would be per invoice. People move. People move hundreds of. People move a lot of money through nickel.
Penny Guilinger: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: The pricing above 35 a month changes. If you're doing, like, an invoice that is more than a million.
Penny Guilinger: Right.
Christian Sheerer: Then we have to have a conversation about, like, we need to treat this. specifically with our banking partners, et cetera, and what have you. But no, yeah, there's no limit up until a million, but you guys wouldn't be doing that.
Penny Guilinger: Yeah. So we pay Fluffy $35 a month to use the platform. It seems with QuickBooks, they can pay my credit card, but the fee gets pushed on them or ACH is free and it'll still come to us.
Christian Sheerer: And if, yeah, exactly. And if you wanted to, you could go in per Customer or you could do it overall youl could split the credit card fee if you have a negotiation with somebody up to them and you but the base logic meaning like the default is it's gonna pass on to them so yeah 35 a month super simple.
Penny Guilinger: Okay, so question say like okay say we send an invoice and youd know it's it goes into collections whatever and then they're like, well, I want to pay my credit card, but they're don't want to pay the whole fee or say we work out that we'll cover 50% of the fee or whatever. Can you go back in that invoice and change the credit card fee, like the percent to like 50 once we've already sent it?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, so I went to customer and I can go and change the credit and debit for that specific customer to be 50.
Penny Guilinger: Huh, okay. Mm-. I'm okay. What? I'm just kind of amazed that it's only $35 a month.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, I mean, it's sort of a, like we expect over time that we'll have more products, right? Which, you know, maybe, and I'm sure.
Penny Guilinger: Like fees will go up, but I.
Christian Sheerer: Don'T think the fees, I don't think the fees on the people, I think we're going to be pretty steadfast in the fees on the people that sign up with us early. We're early in our journey. We're only three years old.
Penny Guilinger: Okay. And so then there's, like, there's not an application process of, like, I mean, obviously you have to link to our business bank account, but, like, you guys don't. Because I set up, like, a free account. I was just kind of, like, looking around, but that's. I'm sure we probably, what, sign a contract or something, or do you even do contracts or how does that work? Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: So the 35 a month is if you sign like a year or if you agree to pay for a year subscription. If you're doing month to month, it's 45 a month. Okay. But yeah, it's also free to get started technically. You have 14 day free trial, so basically prorated for that first month. And yeah, you can pretty much get set up with your first transaction within a day, and then it's. It's. It's one business day turnaround for credit card. It's two business day turnaround for ACH.
Penny Guilinger: Interesting. Okay. I I like it. I just. Do you have, like, I was gonna talk to my boss about it because he obviously has to make, like, the ultimate. Okay, about it. But could you, like, maybe send me, like, a contract of what it would look like so I could talk to him, and then if he's okay with it, like, we could just. sign it and get started.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, you would just. So what is he. What is he looking for in terms of his criteria to kind of give an okay or not?
Penny Guilinger: I mean, honestly, I think he'll be okay. Like, I just need to let him know, like, it's either. So we either can pay 35 a month in full or it's 45 if we do month to month. Okay. I mean, he's just really big on pricing for everything, but I think I feel like he would be okay with it. As long as he knows, like, the credit card fees getting passed on to the client, we don't have to pay for it, and then the ACH is free. I just would have to Make sure he's okay with paying, like, the 35 or 45.
Christian Sheerer: And then it sounded like you were. You were surprised. It's pretty cheap.
Penny Guilinger: I mean, I guess.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah.
Penny Guilinger: I don't really know because I, I haven't really, like, I mean, I've looked at some, but, like, I mean, I don't really know what, like, the average cost. I mean, because, like, QuickBooks, I don't know. I don't know because we didn't really get far into it. I don't, I don't know what we have.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. So they're gonna charge one percent per transaction. So that'll be, like, yeah.
Penny Guilinger: So it's like some.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, our goal is not necessarily to be the cheapest forever. We think we have a pretty good platform that allows people to save a lot of time, but early in our journey, kind of our goal is to, you know, gain the trust in the use of a lot of customers because then we benefit from like, Hey, if somebody's using Nickel to pay you guys, then you might have a positive experience and refer them for their payments that they're getting, you know, that they're using, right? And so we do a referral credit too, where we will give you 250 bucks if you make a referral to somebody who signs up. And so it's a little bit of the game of when you're an early software company, you want to gain the favor of a lot of your customers. And so yeah, we will be cheaper in terms of fees compared to QuickBooks, but I think you'll also see, like we saw today, there's a lot of product depth, right? It is actually well built out. and we have the good backing of like a lot of people in the industry in terms of investment, which allows us to do things and grow the product really fast. And so what's your boss's name?
Penny Guilinger: Paul.
Christian Sheerer: Would Paul want to get on a conversation just so we chat through that stuff, or did you guys want to get signed up and then we can come and have a question about whatever needs troubleshooting, et cetera?
Penny Guilinger: Well, so I'm going to be the one that's doing everything. So basically, I just want to go back to him and be like, Hey, here's what I found. rounds, like, would you be open to doing this? And if he's okay with it, then I would just like to do it. I guess I don't. He's more of, like, the numbers guy and, like, does all that stuff. So I. I mean, I feel like that would be fine, like, per month, because, like you said, everywhere else, like, I haven't. I did build.com, like, long, long time ago, but, like you said, some of them are, like. you know, whatever percentage, like per transaction. And so, like, I don't really know what we would be charged, like, per month. Well, yeah.
Christian Sheerer: If you're doing 600, 000, it'd be. It'd be about six thousand a month.
Penny Guilinger: Yeah. So it's like. I mean, I feel like it's kind of a no-brainer you know? Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: And so I can send over a recap that breaks that down.
Penny Guilinger: Right.
Christian Sheerer: Like, here's what others would look like in terms of, like, one percent transaction fee.
Penny Guilinger: That would be awesome. Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: And then for you, what it would look like on nickel.
Penny Guilinger: And. When.
Christian Sheerer: When do you think you're gonna be able to speak with them?
Penny Guilinger: I can call them today, or, I mean, I can call them after I get off the phone with this. Or whenever you send me the email, I can just talk to them and be like, hey, here's what I found out, and I can send them the email, and we could probably, hopefully, today or tomorrow. that way. Yeah, we can start in September.
Christian Sheerer: Awesome. Yeah. Yeah. The reason I ask is because, like, what we typically do in terms of these processes is like, okay, we get the kind of, you know, initial go ahead. If somebody has to talk to somebody on the team, they do that, and then they get signed up because it's free to sign up and you get set up and maybe you run a couple test transactions or real ones.
Penny Guilinger: Right?
Christian Sheerer: Like we, we process. quite a bit of money. So it doesn't necessarily have to be a test. You can run a real run and it'll go through well. We have like 10,000 people using the platform, 10,000 companies that is. And then we can get back together in about a week's time just to check in and see how everything went. If there's anything that we need to troubleshoot, it should be pretty intuitive. But if there's any questions that Paul or you have, and then we can plan out like a further rollout. Maybe if you guys are paying vendors, we can chat through like what accounts payable looks like as well as accounts receivable, which is what we talked about today. And so, yeah. Do you think that if we got together in, like, a week from now would give us enough time to have the conversation with Apollo, get set up and then run a couple transactions so that we can.
Penny Guilinger: Yeah, I think so. I. So when you say, like, so I signed up for the free account already. I had a I did, but I haven't, like, linked anything or did anything. I was just kind of waiting to see, like, the demo. Okay. So you're saying there's, like, a free trial or something?
Christian Sheerer: Well, yeah, you guys have it. You're on it. Like, we won't charge you until, you know, the 14 days after.
Penny Guilinger: Right.
Christian Sheerer: And so. Exactly. And so. And so, yeah. So I think, like, then you already set up an account. So then the next steps would be just, like, run a couple transactions, and then we can get back together in a week's time to see how those went, whether you. want to run them to your actual customers or like a test one of a couple dollars, sort of up to you.
Penny Guilinger: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: I think it usually is like around three to four where people start to feel really comfortable. The first one, obviously, right? Second one, and then three to four is really where people start to feel comfortable. And then we can come back, answer any questions that you have. They might be silly questions, they might be some things that like, you know, you guys require support. All those are all good. And then we just have a check in and and then. And then help you basically make the most of it down the line.
Penny Guilinger: Okay. Yeah. I mean, that sounds good to me. If you don't mind just sending me that little bit of info you said you could send, I'll get with him. Like I said, either today or tomorrow, and then I'll. I'll see if he wants me to do a couple test runs or if he's just like, no, we're good. I mean, I can still link it, but. I could let you know that way if he is okay with it sooner than a week. Cool. Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. And then let's just save the time to check in in a week.
Penny Guilinger: I am out Monday and Friday of next week, but any of the other days are fine. That Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, let's try Thursday. Does the same time work on Thursday? 1:30.
Penny Guilinger: Yeah. Yep.
Christian Sheerer: Awesome.
Penny Guilinger: Yes.
Christian Sheerer: Two-day turnaround for ACH. Sorry. Two-day turnaround for ACH and one day turnaround for credit card. So if you want to set one up, if. If you're able to chat with him tomorrow and process one, then we should have enough time in between now and then to see the. full process go through before Thursday, if you run one tomorrow. Make sense?
Penny Guilinger: Yep. Cool.
Christian Sheerer: So yeah, I'll send over that recap and the breakdown for you and Paul, and then I'll send over the invite so we can check in on Thursday and I'll drop my contact so you have any, and my phone number, it might be easier to reach me by calling me rather than email if something comes up more urgently.
Penny Guilinger: Okay. Sounds good. Cool. Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: So you have it. You, you have your account already. So your first step's done.
Penny Guilinger: Yeah. Cool.
Christian Sheerer: Awesome.
Penny Guilinger: Awesome. All right. Well, sounds good. I will talk to him and then I will let you know.
Christian Sheerer: All right.
Penny Guilinger: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: You have a good weekend. Have a good holiday.
Penny Guilinger: Thanks. Yep. You too. Bye. See ya.
