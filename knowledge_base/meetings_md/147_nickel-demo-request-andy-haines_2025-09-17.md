Jacob Greenberg: Hey Andy, can you hear me?
Andy Haines: Hey, yes I can.
Jacob Greenberg: How's it going?
Andy Haines: Good.
Jacob Greenberg: Good. So I have half an hour here on my calendar. Does that still work for you? Yep. It does. Okay, great. So tell me a little bit about Heritage Foods and you know how you found Nickel and what your what you're hoping to get?
Andy Haines: Yeah, so Heritage Food and we sell jam and sauce products. And currently we're using QuickBooks, but their ACH fees are just getting so expensive. That's kind of what we're in the market for is to see if there's something out there that can integrate with QuickBooks and we can take our payments through them and kind of lay QuickBooks payments to the side. You all are one of the companies that popped up and don't know a whole lot about it.
Jacob Greenberg: So. Where did we, out of curiosity, where did we pop up? How did you find us?
Andy Haines: Just Google.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, cool. Cool. All right, sweet. So you're using QuickBooks and you're using QuickBooks to receive accounts receivable payments and make payments as well?
Andy Haines: We don't necessarily make payments. It's more just an accounts receivable system.
Jacob Greenberg: And so when you're doing accounts receivable, who are the people that your, who are your typical clients? Is it, are you like distributing to like restaurants and retail or is it direct to consumer?
Andy Haines: It would be to, yeah, it's all wholesale.
Jacob Greenberg: So.
Andy Haines: Storefronts, markets, that sort of thing.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. And what is your typical transaction size and how many are you doing in a given month?
Andy Haines: Typical could be anywhere between one to five thousand dollars.
Jacob Greenberg: And.
Andy Haines: I don't know how many there'd be per month. I mean, we're probably running I.
Jacob Greenberg: Don'T.
Andy Haines: Know, 15 plus a day, so.
Jacob Greenberg: 15 transactions daily.
Andy Haines: That's right.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah. Yeah. Gotcha.
Andy Haines: And that's. That's kind of a guess. I mean, I haven't.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah. Gotcha. Okay. Cool. And so you're using QuickBooks right now. Do you know what the rates are right now for your QuickBooks? I know it's different for each customer based on when they signed up.
Andy Haines: It's $7 for ACH and then of course the credit card. Gotcha.
Jacob Greenberg: So they still have you on the $7. I've been dealing with a lot of customers whose rates went up from 7% recently to 1% of the transaction but uncapped. So I know that that's an initiative they're taking at QuickBooks. I don't know if they've rolled it out to everyone or if it's slow and over time. Okay, so you're looking at if you're doing 15 transactions a day, you're paying $7 per transaction. That can add up over time for sure. It's looking at like $3,000 a month in fees for ACH. What is the percentage, would you say, estimate? Of like how many of your transactions are ACH versus how many of them are credit card?
Andy Haines: I would say a majority are ACH. There's very few credit card.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay. And when you do credit card, Do you pass the fees on to the customer or are you paying those yourself?
Andy Haines: Yeah, we do pass the credit card fee on to the customer.
Jacob Greenberg: How do you do that right now? Do you update the invoice itself with the additional fee?
Andy Haines: That's right, yep.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. Okay, cool. All right, so I'm happy to show you a little bit around Nickel. I'm going to pop up in my demo environment here. I'll give you a quick background about us while I get it loaded. Takes a second, but Nickel was founded by our founder, who, before Nickel worked at Stanley Black and Decker leading the innovations team there. And so we're actually backed by Stanley Black and Decker and DeWalt. We're initially built for, here, I'm just trying to get this going real quick. We're initially built specifically for like contractors and construction companies for the built built world industries because those are companies that usually deal with some pretty serious cash flow problems, carrying around checks for a long time in their truck, needing to have cash from the last job before they could do the next job. So we wanted to create a solution to solve for those instances. And in doing so, we wanted to make a super, super easy to use solution that enabled our users to allow their customers to pay in whichever payment type they prefer. Give them every option available in a singular place without it making a negative impact for the user themselves in their business. So we enable your customers to pay in ACH or with credit card, no fees to the business whatsoever, no fees at all for ACH for both your clients and yourself. Really quick settlement times and unlimited transaction amounts. So that's why we built Nickel. Very quickly after developing it, we realized this applies a lot more than just contractors and construction. So let me show you the demo environment here. So this would be your overview of your transaction page. And you said you do use QuickBooks, right?
Andy Haines: QuickBooks.
Jacob Greenberg: That's right. Yep.
Andy Haines: Are you using online or desktop? We're currently using desktop, but I know that's kind of going outside. It looks like what only QuickBooks Online works with Nickel, is that correct?
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, we integrate directly with QuickBooks Online at the moment. And we do know that QuickBooks is.
Andy Haines: Migrating its users from desktop over to online. Yeah. So, I mean, our renewal is coming up here in the next month, which is also kind of why I'm looking around for other options.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. So yeah, if you're doing all of your accounting out of QuickBooks and you do end up migrating to QuickBooks online, we have a two-way sync. If you don't have a direct integration, we do make it really easy to download transactions from Nickel and push it into QuickBooks. So. This would be your transaction page here. It's easy to see all your transactions from a glance. Or just your receivables or just your payables if you do end up paying any bills through this like rent or utilities. You can add a filter to search by the invoice purpose or invoice number, however you ID your invoices. If they're coming from QuickBooks, I assume there'll be invoice numbers. You can search by customer business or any specific date range. It just makes it really easy to find all of your transaction history. But where you guys will be living out of is the Get Paid tab here. For accounts receivable, this is where you're going to live. And you'll see all of your transactions listed here. So you'll see the active or completed transactions by clicking on the corresponding tab. You can even schedule transactions for the future to send out. Do you have recurring bills with the storefronts and vendors that you work with, or is it just one-time transactions typically?
Andy Haines: Yeah, it would be one-time transaction, but it's repeat. They would come back, but each order is going to be different. Every time.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. Okay. Yeah. So in that case, if you did push from here to QuickBooks, you'll be able to import everything that you do within here into QuickBooks. You'll just need to manually create it within Nickel first. And to create an invoice, you come in here and you select your customer information. So, I'm going to do. A little. Test on this one real quick. So. Add Andy Haines as a customer. Put my email address in here, put in the QuickBooks invoice and the amount. Now you'll set the invoice date. And do you guys ever do net terms with your clients?
Andy Haines: Not really, no. It's just due on receipt.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. So when it's due on receipt, what you do is you'll just put the due date as the same day you create the invoice. Any additional notes for this transaction can go here. Another cool thing about this is you could upload any documents directly onto the transaction level. If you have a contract with them, if you have photos of the produce or photos of the delivery, whatever you want to include, you can include directly in here. Go ahead and click Create. That's how you create the invoice. Now you can send this via text message or via email or via both. You could also charge the payment method on file. So if you do have the customer's banking information that you already work with, you could add it here and just automatically schedule the charge or charge that customer directly. I'm going to send this link to myself, show you what it looks like. And so this is what the email receipt would look like. Instead of DeGraaf Distribution, which is our dummy demo account name right here, it would be your company name. You'd be able to upload your logo as well right here, so it's all branded. We'll have the amount of the transaction, the due date, the invoice number, and any additional notes for the transaction. Simply go ahead and click pay now. And what your customer will see here is the option to choose how they would like to pay. Any of the documents that were corresponding to this invoice that you uploaded before would show here. Any previous transaction history with this one customer, they'll be able to access all of their historic transactions right here. They'll show below. And you'll be able to allow them to choose to pay by card with a 2.99% fee, which will be passed directly to the customer, and you guys will not incur that cost. You also won't need to update the invoice manually. We'll take care of that for you. So each of your invoices, you just need to put in the exact amount that you are owed for that transaction. Making accounting just a little simpler. And they'll see if they do select pay by card, there'll be a little bit of an additional fee here. If they do select pay by bank, it will be exactly the invoice number because there are no fees whatsoever. But if they choose to pay by card, which we kind of see is between 17-22% of the time for Nickel users, their customers elects to pay by card for cash flow advantage purposes or just because they already have a 3% cash back card or something like that. Makes it easy. And yeah, this is the Nickel invoice in a nutshell. This is an optional button that you can add, but you can add the feature to allow your customer to edit the payment amount. So if you do ever take deposits, they'll be able to pay the deposit upon the opening of this deal with them and pay the remainder of the balance at the end. But yeah, so this is very straightforward. Very basic and easy to use for both your AR team, yourself, and your customers. Once the payment has been made, it will move from this active status into a completed status over here. You'll be able to see the due date that was originally done and the completed date, so once it was actually finished. You can also track outstanding invoices and send them a reminder as well. So just by clicking on do on, you can see all of your overdue ones. And if you have a bunch of overdue ones, you can just automatically send them all payment requests one more time as a reminder.
Andy Haines: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: You have any questions so far about what I'm showing you?
Andy Haines: How would it integrate with QuickBooks online? I mean, I guess that'd be the biggest thing is, is.
Jacob Greenberg: So.
Andy Haines: If I create all the invoices on QuickBooks Online and then I sync it with Nickel, and then when I send that out, does the invoice go with the email? If that makes sense?
Jacob Greenberg: So if you do transition over to QuickBooks Online, First thing you'll do is go to account settings down here, the left hand side, click on integrations on the far right and link your QuickBooks account. Now your first time syncing might take up to five or six minutes, but after that it's an instantaneous automatic two way sync. So you'll see all of your invoices and customer information that comes from QuickBooks will actually have a little QuickBooks icon next to it. So you'll know which ones are synced, but it should be everything once you do set up the integration. And when you go to generate that invoice, so right now you're generating the invoice within QuickBooks, you can do that the exact same way. Second, it's done generating within QuickBooks, it will push to Nickel. You can click on that invoice and just click this request payment button here. And it will send out the invoice itself can be attached directly to the invoice portal. The line item PDF invoice that's generated with QuickBooks, if you are generating those and sending those out, you'll have that attached here and you can upload any additional documents as well.
Andy Haines: That automatically attaches to it though. It's not like I have to have an extra step or anything in there.
Jacob Greenberg: I think you have to download and attach it again, but let me double check on that. It actually might be automated. All right, I'll get a response in a couple minutes here. As far as the user workflow, it does happen automatically.
Andy Haines: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: Quick response. As far as user workflow, how are you feeling? What are you thinking about Nickel for your business?
Andy Haines: I mean, it seems straightforward. Yeah, I mean, if it would integrate with QuickBooks Online real easy, that would be the biggest thing. I mean, like I said, switching online isn't necessarily a problem, but just to make sure I understand, right? So when I create an invoice in, let's say QuickBooks Online, As soon as I save it online there, it'll automatically update into Nickel or do I have to go somewhere and sync it? The reason why I ask is because I'm using bill.com on another business that I'm running and you have to actually go in and sync it.
Jacob Greenberg: It's an automatic sync. Once you create the invoice, if you're using QuickBooks to create the invoice, you can also create the invoice with a Nickel if you want to. And we'll update it within QuickBooks. You can create it within QuickBooks, it'll update it to Nickel automatically. The PDF invoice will automatically be attached to Nickel if you create the QuickBooks invoice. All you need to do is come into Nickel, see what has not been sent yet, so you could just go filter on sent invoices and then send them all out. All you need to do is select them and click send payments. You can send multiple at the same time. But they'll just automatically generate here for you. And once they're completed and paid, not only is it marked as paid in Nickel, it will also be marked as paid within QuickBooks instantaneously.
Andy Haines: Okay. And that's another thing that I kind of ran into with Bill is so quick in my customer base, you know, say one customer has three or four emails that I'm sending it out to. As carbon copies. How does that, does that transfer over to Nickel also? Because with Bill, it only takes just the main email and it actually doesn't attach all the extra email behind it, if that makes sense.
Jacob Greenberg: Well, yeah, we recap that for me one more time. Sorry. Yeah.
Andy Haines: So our customers can have, they want the invoice sent out to say three different emails. Right now with bill.com, it will only sync over one of the emails. And so, you know, basically two of the emails are left out. Do you know if Nickel, does Nickel, when it syncs, does it take all the emails that are in the QuickBooks database and send it to it or is it just going with the main email?
Jacob Greenberg: I believe it goes to one individual email but again let me double check on that with the dev team and see if there's multiple. One second here.
Andy Haines: Okay, maybe a better way to explain it would be so some of our customers have a a field rep. And so they place the order, and I need to send the invoice to the field rep so he knows that this customer placed an order, but I also obviously want to send it to the customer. And with bill.com, it's only, say, just sending it to the customer, and it's not able to pull the field reps email over, even though if you go into QuickBooks, You know, there's two emails attached to that account.
Jacob Greenberg: Not for this business, but for a different one.
Andy Haines: That's right, yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. How long have you been using Bill?
Andy Haines: Well, I just started that in the last month.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, got it. Yeah, I think Bill has fees as well as similar to QuickBooks, no?
Andy Haines: Their ACH is like 50 cents a transaction, so it's significantly less.
Jacob Greenberg: Are you doing credit cards with them.
Andy Haines: Too or just the, yeah, I'm doing credit cards with them also.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. Is it also, sorry to ask so many questions, just curious, is it also a food business?
Andy Haines: Like, it would be, yeah, yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: Cool. All right, so. The answer is yes. We could pull multiple email addresses and send to multiple. It's just a preference of yours that you'll put in the settings on Nickel.
Andy Haines: Cool.
Jacob Greenberg: So. Coming up on time here, I could show you a little bit more inside the platform. There's some Easter eggs that I do want to show you that are cool. One is this payments portal itself. So we have some customers that will just embed this direct on their website and make it easier for customers to pay via credit card or via ACH when in person or just online. So Chicago Brass is one of our earlier customers that have adopted this solution. They'll just have a pay invoice button here on their website. And it's branded, to the Chicago Brass brand and customers just go in here and make a payment automatically. Now you can edit this payment portal field so that you have different fields that a customer needs to upload. So if you want to get the company name specifically or they're responding to a specific invoice number, stuff like that, you can have them upload this. But yeah, that is pretty much Nickel in a nutshell. Bill pay is a lot like get paid. It's a lot like AR. Except removing the one step of requiring the customer to put in the payment on their own. And you can automatically send out payments or set recurring payments, but it's a pretty straightforward solution and we're really intending to build out a lot of cash flow advantage products like more advanced net terms features that might not apply to you directly, but also trade credit and stuff like that.
Andy Haines: Okay, cool.
Jacob Greenberg: Well, yeah. Do you have a good temperature check on how Nickel might be implemented for heritage?
Andy Haines: I mean, I have to just kind of play around with a little bit more and see. Probably at this point, the bigger thing is what the migration to QuickBooks online is going to look like. I mean, it seems like, it seems like Nickel would work pretty straightforward as far as payments go, possibly a little, a little easier than what bill.com would.
Jacob Greenberg: Be.
Andy Haines: But, but, yeah, I'll, I'll just have to think about it, talk, talk to the owner about it and try to figure some more stuff out here, but.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, gotcha. So yeah, as far as like the decision making process, it's just you and the owner who are involved in that.
Andy Haines: That's right, yep.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. Okay, cool. It seems like this would make more sense for you guys once you transitioned over to QuickBooks Online. Am I getting that correct?
Andy Haines: Yeah, it would kind of. And it seems like, did I see somewhere, what is there, like a $30 a month? Subscription. Is that what it is?
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, well, you can either do, there's a free account that you could create today. It's called Nickel core. And the big difference between the free account and the plus version is that on the free account, it caps your transaction size per transaction to twenty five thousand dollars. But if most of your transactions are under that, I would go ahead and sign up and start testing around with it on your own for free for now.
Andy Haines: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: And then when you're ready to upgrade, you can just upgrade on your own. Whenever you cross that bridge, you need to maybe get one day quicker settlement times or do some larger transactions. Yeah, but in the meantime, I think.
Andy Haines: So one of the questions I did just think about was so if a customer does an ACH and doesn't have the money in their bank account, but they try to process it like they do, how long until that bounces basically. Because I know with QuickBooks, I think we're looking at about three days until it kicks back. Is that about the same?
Jacob Greenberg: I said one more time, I'm sorry.
Andy Haines: So with QuickBooks, a customer can go in and make a payment and basically they're writing a bounce check. And three days later, QuickBooks takes the money again, says customer didn't have the money. Is that about average with Nickel? I mean, can a customer do that?
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, it's like a two to three day turnaround. So it's similar to QuickBooks on that time for him for notifying it if there wasn't enough money in the account, et cetera.
Andy Haines: What's the chargeback fee?
Jacob Greenberg: There isn't a fee for chargeback. We'll just try to settle it. We'll just try to sell it for you or on your behalf or with you and the customer. And there's no additional cost associated.
Andy Haines: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah. Does that happen frequently?
Andy Haines: And it don't happen. No, it don't happen frequently, but it definitely does happen. And QuickBooks charges a $10 return check fee. Oh, that's what it comes in as.
Jacob Greenberg: So. Yeah, the only additional fee that you'll find in our solution besides the monthly cost and the credit card fee that gets put onto the customer during transactions is we have an optional we'll send checks on your behalf if you do use us for bill pay and that's $2 per check. But those are the only fees that you're going to see within our system.
Andy Haines: Okay. Is there an option if we wanted to cover the 3% fee that we could, you know, pay the 3% credit card fee?
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, absolutely. So you can either on a universal level, so like as your main settings for every invoice you set, or on an individual transaction level, you can on both, you could customize how much of that 2.9% is being split between you and the customer. It's just most of the time people will use Nickel to put 100% of the fee onto the customer since you're giving them the option to pay by ACH, excuse me, which is free. Order paid by credit card. But we do have some like distributors that work with manufacturers or wholesalers and they'll have like repeat business with them and custom agreements about how they'll share their credit card rates.
Andy Haines: Okay. Yeah, well, I think that answers all the questions I have as of now.
Jacob Greenberg: So, well, I'm happy that we made some time to connect. It seems like next steps are going to be you talk internally with the CEO. And, you know, maybe we revisit the conversation once you guys kind of found a timeline for the QuickBooks online integration and if, if you end up moving forward with that. Yeah.
Andy Haines: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: Do you have, do you have a timeline in mind? Like, is that definitely happening or is it something you guys are considering integrating or transitioning to QuickBooks online?
Andy Haines: At this point, it really kind of depends on basically this system. So like I said, I changed over to bill.com on the other business and it can sync with desktop but there's a few things I don't know if I necessarily like. So QuickBooks Online plus the other thing actually is next year is the last year for QuickBooks desktop. Yeah, so, you know, we're kind of under a time crunch there anyways, so and like I said, our renewal with QuickBooks comes up here in the next month.
Jacob Greenberg: So.
Andy Haines: Yeah, there's just a lot of things happening all at once basically is kind of where we're at right now.
Jacob Greenberg: Right. All right, well, how about this? Maybe we could check in again in like a month or so and just touch base and see if you guys have made some progress with the QuickBooks side and that way I know whether or not we should keep communication channels open or if we should just set a timeline for the project.
Andy Haines: Yeah, that'd be fine.
Jacob Greenberg: All right, cool. How about sometime in the What's the longest day? Well, like mid-October with like the 14th, which is a Tuesday start of the, you know, third week of October work for you? Yeah.
Andy Haines: Or could we do the 16th?
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, 16th works too. Yeah.
Andy Haines: This Monday through Wednesday is a little crazier than towards the end of the week, so.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. All good. All right. So the email address that I have, Here is one second. We've got Andy@heritagefoodcompany.com is that the best?
Andy Haines: That's right.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay perfect. Yep. And. Awesome. I'll throw on some time for 1:30 to 2:00 how's that sound?
Andy Haines: Yeah that'd be fine.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay great.
Andy Haines: All right, great.
Jacob Greenberg: I'm gonna send that out right now.
Andy Haines: Okay. All right.
Jacob Greenberg: Andy, it was great talking to you today and see you next month.
Andy Haines: All right, sounds good. Thank you.
Jacob Greenberg: Take it easy. Bye.
