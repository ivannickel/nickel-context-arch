Byron Floyd: How you doing? Can you hear me?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, good. How are you?
Byron Floyd: Good, good. Sorry, I'm remotely working at a place today, so. I'm not going to turn my camera on. No
Christian Sheerer: worries. I'll join you in the same boat. You're
Byron Floyd: good. Yep.
Christian Sheerer: Awesome. Well, 30 minutes still work for you?
Byron Floyd: Yeah, that's fine. Yeah, I'm waiting for my business Ryan to get in here, but I don't know if he's going to make it.
Christian Sheerer: Oh, yeah, I didn't see him on the invite. Do you want me to send him an email?
Byron Floyd: Oh, yeah, you didn't see him on that? Ryan at EverLifeSteel.com.
Christian Sheerer: Ever, yeah, okay.
Byron Floyd: ryan
Christian Sheerer: r-y-a-n
Byron Floyd: yep cool
Christian Sheerer: i just sent him an invite i mean you can send him the link too i'm sure you did already but um but yeah cool
Byron Floyd: cool um i mean
Christian Sheerer: yeah while we wait for him do you i know You're taking a look at us primarily on kind of like the ACH side. I have a history of sort of, you know, your interactions with us. But I don't know too much. I think that would be kind of like where I started is around like what you guys are currently doing for payments. Then I can give a backstory on how Nickel got started. We can go into the weeds on. the more specific stuff around what we do
Byron Floyd: yeah
Christian Sheerer: show you around the platform see if it might be good and then we can plan out um sort of a rollout for y'all
Byron Floyd: for sure
Christian Sheerer: as we get there
Byron Floyd: okay um we currently use quickbooks uh for payments um we mainly do ach um if we do credit cards we do kind of tack on a fee for that the problem is is what we sell steel buildings so a lot of our payments are rather large. And even at 1%, you know, we're kind of taking a hit, you know, over the long term with that. So, you know, I did, I swore when I signed up for QuickBooks, it said 1% with a $10 max fee for ACH. And then it's not, it's not, it's not what it is. So, so, you know, just, we're kind of looking for a better alternative to kind of save some money on those fees. not have to pass it on to our customers
Christian Sheerer: yeah where in the range of large is that are you guys sitting yeah
Byron Floyd: yeah so i guess that's why i wanted to set this up too because i want to make sure there's no like limits like um it could be like we have a i have an invoice i'm about to send out for 105 000
Christian Sheerer: okay yeah yeah
Byron Floyd: yeah so who's that going to sila they just they did the po for the for the fabrication deposit so nice
Ryan Daniels: nice what's Christian my name is ryan What's
Christian Sheerer: up, Ryan? Nice to have you join us. Yeah, Byron was really,
Ryan Daniels: he
Christian Sheerer: kind of was explaining that, like, as soon as you hopped on. You guys are on Intuit. You're using, you guys use QuickBooks online for the ERP?
Byron Floyd: Yeah, but I don't like QuickBooks, but it's not that there's anything wrong with QuickBooks. I just, I just don't like it.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, I don't think anybody likes their accounting software. Right? Like, I don't know. I just
Byron Floyd: like the best in class
Christian Sheerer: one. Yeah. Okay, cool. You know, the reason I break that out is because, so, I mean, you guys are sort of exactly who the type of. you know people we want to be speaking to this is like who nickel was built for uh for lack of a better catch-all phrase it is payments for the built world uh i guess right built world industries but you know our best clients are you know manufacturers fabricators or wholesale distributors uh even people who sell like avocados right uh or are selling to grocery stores or um selling a bunch of fish or what have you, selling a bunch of steel. And so we found it wasn't me. I joined a couple of months ago, but we as a company figured out, OK, one of our founders came from Stanley Black and Decker. He led the kind of innovation unit there, built out a lot of products and was like, oh, well, none of these people in this world have like a simple way to transact because the average payment is so large. like it. you know a fifty thousand dollar payment is like a small one uh you know for some of our customers a hundred thousand dollar payment is a small one and it's like par for the course sure um and you know they're doing it on check or they have like four different ways that they have to accept it right like they have one processor for their credit card transactions they have the check process which is all paper it takes like you know seven days to you know wait for it in the mail and and drive it to
Byron Floyd: the
Christian Sheerer: bank. And then they have some... probably connected to their ERP, like Intuit Payments, some ACH thing
Byron Floyd: that's
Christian Sheerer: scraping 1% off the top. And then our other founder came from Airbnb. He built out the payment system there and they linked up and they were like, okay, I think this is a pretty good opportunity to just build like a really from scratch deep infrastructure to be able to handle large payments and then build a simple kind of user interface on top of it that over time we could do a bunch of really cool things if we're sitting at the lifeblood of, you know, the businesses that we're dealing with, which is on their payments infrastructure. So no limits. I mean, if you're going above a million per transaction, we have to have a conversation about like pricing and stuff. It's not that we can't do it. It's just it's not part of the typical plan. But. No limits. And I assume that that's not a super high volume. Like what is your typical volume in terms of invoices per month and what those on average the figure is?
Byron Floyd: Yeah, I mean, we probably would be anywhere between like once we get we're kind of a newer company. We're not new in the business, but we're a newer company. And we're probably going to be, you know, within the next six months, I would say between like maybe 10 and 20 transactions a month, somewhere in that range.
Christian Sheerer: Cool. Yeah, yeah. That's no worries either. I mean, if you were like, hey, we have to do 10,000 as another conversation, but
Byron Floyd: even
Christian Sheerer: then we would be able to handle it. It's just to give you, I guess, to reassure you that the limits, you wouldn't even be coming close to them, which is good. And they're usually of that size, of the 100K range?
Byron Floyd: They're going to be anywhere from like 5,000 up to... I would probably say like 100 to 150 usually in that range. And
Christian Sheerer: that's just, is it, so some people that we speak to have the same type of process. They have it really dialed in for, you know, you're saying that that was for the deposit up front. Is it the same? So are each of your customers going through the same type of process where it's like full?
Byron Floyd: Yeah, so generally they're going to be. We have what's called an engineering deposit, and that's going to be a little lower. So that'll be like around $5,000, we'll say.
Christian Sheerer: And
Byron Floyd: then once we get them their engineering, then they're going to make the fabrication deposit, which is going to be the higher of the two. So if it's like a $35,000 building, we're like at $5,000, then we're at $30,000. This company happens to be buying a $130,000 building. So
Ryan Daniels: that's
Byron Floyd: why they're ready for the fabrication deposit. So it's just, yeah, it's the same percentages, and we do have it dialed in that way. It's just every building is a different cost. You know what I
Christian Sheerer: mean? Awesome. Yeah, no, no. This helps me because like when we get into the platform, which will be pretty foolproof for you all to use, kind of like use your own language to be able to explain here. Here's how we'll set up the engineering deposit in the second one.
Byron Floyd: Gotcha.
Christian Sheerer: And it's it's two invoices each time. Is that the kind of desired way you want to do it? Like two invoices for them or right?
Byron Floyd: Yeah, you know, that's kind
Christian Sheerer: of
Byron Floyd: the company we came from. That's kind of what they did. Right, Ryan? they would do like two separate invoices. I'm kind of, I came from like the construction industry. So like I would basically send someone an estimate for the whole job. And then I would take, you know, then they would have different amounts due at certain times. So like I, and we need to talk about that as well. Ryan probably talk about that with the accountant on the best way long term to set up. You know what I mean? So like if we send somebody an invoice for, if there's a $35,000 building, we send them the invoice. It's 35,000, but the deposit is this, right? And then it's just an open invoice in the system. You know, I'm just thinking for accounting purposes, long-term, how we should do that. Or we just send an individual invoice each time. which is fine as well so but right now that's what we do so individual invoice
Christian Sheerer: cool um awesome does any anybody ever pay you outside of ach like in another process like through a check or
Byron Floyd: yeah sometimes people will send us a check um but like you said the waiting game and then um and then do you guys do check processing uh
Christian Sheerer: i mean we're gonna we we are building out remote check deposit sort of like That would be for the stragglers though, right? I mean, our, as you can imagine, our business is trying to educate customers on why it might be easier to move into the 21st century and- Oh
Byron Floyd: yeah. ...
Ryan Daniels: secure, right?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, we're
Byron Floyd: with you on that. We just-
Christian Sheerer: Yeah.
Byron Floyd: No, no,
Christian Sheerer: no. I hear you. Yeah, yeah. So yes, but it's really a secondary focus because we think
Byron Floyd: we
Christian Sheerer: could capture a lot of it. Like a lot of our customers, I mean, I wouldn't say a lot, but some of the ones that we like a lot, one of them, you know, they've been around since 1890, right? And they got started with us. They were only using checks. And they're like, oh, wow, we're going to save, you know, and they tell us 10, 15 hours a month, let alone like if you could probably extrapolate that into days because now they're not having to pray for a check in the mail and like drive it over and, you know, handling like $100,000. check in your truck right um so like the the the check stuff is you know you know we want to build out the capacity to capture it um but it's mainly you know electronic payments via ach or credit card um and we sort of just give the option on the invoice to the customer so like your customer um to pick however they want and sort of so that you don't have to you know chase them down once you've sent them over uh you know a payment link that they can pay out against
Byron Floyd: right yep yeah we don't even give checks as an option that just only happens when people insist on it so
Christian Sheerer: cool
Ryan Daniels: it's happened once
Byron Floyd: yeah
Ryan Daniels: he's gonna do it for the next one too and that one's gonna be a another like hundred thousand or something
Christian Sheerer: yeah it's
Ryan Daniels: fucking awesome isn't it
Byron Floyd: and we and we bank with relay bank so it's like all online and so we have certain check deposit limit so i can't even drive to the bank so that'll be fun figure out but
Christian Sheerer: yeah and so so yeah i'll show you because i think like i think you'll be able to wrap your heads around around nickel pretty pretty pretty quickly um the first thing you'll do is just you'll just tie up to your quickbooks account um quick iteration integration it's it this happens in like five minutes. You just pick the right chart of accounts and you've moved it over already. And invoicing will get created there is my prescription. You can also create invoices, a two-way sync. So you can create invoices at Nickel and I'll show you how to do that today just because it allows me to go through the entire flow of everything. But if you're creating them in QuickBooks, because that's where everything's going to get settled in general, these, you know. vendors will pop in or the customers will pop in with a little QuickBooks icon in green, as well as your customers and the invoice will pop in in green.
Byron Floyd: So basically you're saying it syncs both ways. Like either way we do it, there's not like a better way, right? So if we decide we want to do invoicing through you, that's fine as well. It just populates in QuickBooks.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, the slight reason it's better to do it in QuickBooks is just because they have like a little bit more functionality on creating. with like multi-line items
Byron Floyd: i got you
Christian Sheerer: yeah um and if somebody's so for example right so if i'm i'm gonna i'm gonna create a payment um in quickbooks and i'm gonna go in and let's just imagine it already got created but i'll create a new invoice Christian one of one of my alter egos and i'll say engineering deposit of 5k. one time we can do recurring payments i don't it doesn't sound like you guys you're just kind of doing one-off projects right Okay, cool. I can set the invoice date when I send it to them to a date and the due date being a different one or it's going to default to linking them up on the same day. But that invoice from QuickBooks would just have already uploaded here automatically.
Byron Floyd: Gotcha. So
Christian Sheerer: that's why it's slightly easier because we're just going to pull it from there. And then I'm going to go and I'm going to send a secure payment link. So I can also charge. payment methods on file if you have like repeat customers and you want to hold their information and just be able to charge it right away assuming that you've sent them some verification that they've signed up on or authorization that they've signed off on and
Byron Floyd: you just
Christian Sheerer: pull it from them straight away but this is kind of the default logic we send a one-to-one secure payment link
Byron Floyd: so
Christian Sheerer: that there's no kind
Byron Floyd: of
Christian Sheerer: risk of like you know
Byron Floyd: attaching
Christian Sheerer: this engineering deposit Christian 14 to another invoice, right? We don't do batch processing. We can do bulk invoicing. So there's a little bit different, right? Like we can send multiple invoices at once just so it's super easy. Maybe every week you send that 12 or every, you know, two weeks or whatever. Or you can send it one by one by one by one, and I'll send it over. And it's one invoice per one payment. So when I go to my email as a customer now. So now I'm Byron and Ryan's customer. I'll get this email and say, okay, cool. Everlife has requested 5,000 for my engineering deposit. I'll go in right here. They'd be able to see that document where it's coming in and they'll be able to pay. So this is where that invoice would sit, like a PDF of that invoice. They can see the other unpaid invoices that they have too. So maybe they've waited to pay out both the engineering deposit and the fabrication and they'll see both of them and can go and click into each of them. So they have the, I have three different invoices from DeGraw Distribution Christian and I can just pay whatever way I want. You don't have to collect their information. That quickens up a lot of time too. you don't have to just, you know. badger them for an account and routing number or card number
Byron Floyd: gotcha so you got they input their their information and then that just collects the payment and then if they pay if we leave so if they pay by card it charges them the fee
Christian Sheerer: up to you yeah uh the default is that it's passing on to them 2.9 percent and if you want you can split it uh Uh, You can take the 100% of that 2.99%. You can take 99. You could take 50%. You could take 70. You could take 40, whatever you want. But the default is that it passes on to them.
Byron Floyd: Okay. Is that always on there, or can we turn off pay-by-card?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, I guess. Why would you turn it off?
Byron Floyd: Yeah, I mean, I guess if they see that it charges them the money, I guess there'd be no reason to. Yeah,
Christian Sheerer: this is just avoiding that situation where you'd have to go back and add it in as a line item, which might trip over the wire of some surcharging laws in some states. Do you guys
Byron Floyd: primarily
Christian Sheerer: operate in one state?
Byron Floyd: No, we operate in all 50. Okay,
Christian Sheerer: cool. Yeah. And I mean, I should know this on the top of my head, which ones have kind of... it's not federally a problem but in individual states you can't technically add like a line item for those but because we're handling the transaction
Byron Floyd: um
Christian Sheerer: it's sort of a nice way around it uh yeah we're handling the transaction sort of as like a service uh so it's different than like you know tacking it on for the actual job so you'll always get the five thousand uh they will just to have paid $5,149.50. Okay. Yeah. Got it. Cool. And so, yeah, that's creating and sending out an invoice. It's pretty simple. The ones that get completed will move into paid, and they'll move into paid in your QuickBooks as soon as it's paid out as well. You can also track the ones that are overdue, track them by when they're due, and we can take all these large payments should they. should they need to go out. Can also send reminders too. So if I sent out that payment and I say, hey, this version Christian hasn't paid me out, I can send a reminder really quickly and it'll just go back into my email as well as the receiver of the invoice as the customer. Gotcha. Cool. Yeah, store all the customer information. We'll be able to track them by here. You don't have to worry about holding on to their account writing number. Do you guys pay vendors in QuickBooks too?
Byron Floyd: Yeah, no, we don't. We pay through like their that's a good question. When we pay for fabrication, we probably will. Yes.
Christian Sheerer: Cool. I mean, the sort of the idea behind nickel is like one place to be the, you know, you know, I'm trying to use my blood analogy. If payments are the lifeblood of a business, you know, you have one where the heart. OK, there you go. That's what it is. Where the where the cardiovascular system. So yeah. you can pay out bills here too um your vendors will pop over from i don't know why it's taking a long time to load but your vendors will pop over from from quickbooks as well and then all those transactions
Byron Floyd: um
Christian Sheerer: will get stored here so you'll see receivables in one tab payables in another um and then all the transactions you can kind of filter through uh as you go gotcha and those stragglers that are still paying by check So let's say Christian wanted to pay me by check. He did it outside of nickel, outside of any online platform. I can just go in and mark as paid and it's going to move, move out. And that payment link is going to be sort of, they can open it up again and say, Hey, it was paid. Awesome. But sort of voided and you don't really need it anymore. And that'll also get updated into QuickBooks as well.
Byron Floyd: Got it.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, what are the impressions so far?
Byron Floyd: I mean, it looks simple. It looks, you know, so there's just no fees on bank transfer, on the ACH transfers. They want to take like two to four days or how? Yeah,
Christian Sheerer: turnaround time is two business days for ACH with the. With card, it's one business day. Okay. With the volume, or sorry, the amount per transaction that you guys are doing, being above $25,000 is really where we elevate you into like nickel plus territory, which is $35,000 a month. So it's $35,000 a month to use the software. And then, yeah, there's no fees per transaction unless you're eating some of those credit card fees for it. your customers or you're paying a vendor with a credit card which would be 2.9 percent um regardless of what card provider you're using okay as well
Byron Floyd: so you're saying we would need we would need to use the 35 a month one is that what you're saying
Christian Sheerer: yeah yeah the the free one is you wouldn't be able to do a transaction above 25 000
Byron Floyd: oh gotcha gotcha okay yeah no big deal
Christian Sheerer: yeah yeah and i mean honestly like When I sketch out the ROI, let's say you guys are doing your, let's say it's, it sounds like I'm just putting in a rough estimate of like 500 K a month from the five to a hundred thousand per transaction. Yeah. That's like what? 5,000 a month you save or something.
Byron Floyd: Right. Or no, that's.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. That's
Byron Floyd: right. Percent
Christian Sheerer: of 500. And, and, and so it's.
Byron Floyd: it's almost
Christian Sheerer: funny when people ask me for pricing i'm like hey you're kind of gonna laugh like the uh the idea here is like you know there are going to be things that we do that we build out like a trade credit is is like a you know
Byron Floyd: very
Christian Sheerer: high on our list of priorities of things that we want to build there's going to be other kind of like fancy things that we put on top of just like this very simple ui um that will probably be price gated but the idea is like you know we want to gain favor with our initial customers we want to build up our customer base build up our payment network um and sort of you know use the free ach as like a costco hot dog right yeah
Byron Floyd: yeah
Christian Sheerer: yeah
Byron Floyd: for sure cool um so once we once we integrate with quickbooks we just go into quickbooks to create the invoice and then it syncs right up with and this or like do we I mean, I guess, are we able to send the invoice from QuickBooks or do we still come into this interface to send it?
Christian Sheerer: You totally could if that's the way. I mean. So the people I prescribed that way of doing things to people who have, you know, let's say 100 ish customers who it would be a burden for them to go and try to educate them about. We're switching the way that you're going to actually pay out through us. And you're going to now see this payment link rather than the full QuickBooks email. I'd say it's probably pretty easy for you to. you know educate the 10 12 customers you have a month on like hey just use this payment link here um because if you're sending it via quickbooks you would have to just copy that payment link from nickel put it into a text field on the
Byron Floyd: invoice
Christian Sheerer: and
Byron Floyd: then
Christian Sheerer: send it over to them um and i would say it's probably easiest to just you know you have it created and then i'm going to go in and request payment and send them that payment link so i
Byron Floyd: could
Christian Sheerer: request payment copy this you know paste that into the quickbooks invoice and send it out that way
Byron Floyd: and
Christian Sheerer: then you just have to tell them hey this is going to be way better for us right uh you know allows us to be a leaner business because we're going to save the one percent or whatever language you want to use um you know use that nickel payments link and and we'll be able to you know spend more time on better people because we're saving that five thousand dollars a month or whatever however you want to you know set it up um or you're
Byron Floyd: saying
Christian Sheerer: hey we're going to send this link yeah Yeah,
Byron Floyd: I mean, technically, we don't have multiple one-item invoices. Right, Ryan? I mean, usually it just says engineering deposit and fabrication deposit.
Ryan Daniels: Depending if they do the credit card, then that would be the fee for
Byron Floyd: that. Well, no, because they built show them that again, will you, Christian? Automatically
Ryan Daniels: put in them. Yeah,
Byron Floyd: they automatically, basically it shows you on the right, or it'll show you like if they pay with credit card, this is how much it is. If they pay with bank transfer, this is how much it is.
Ryan Daniels: Like installation doors and windows, we can just include that into the building price.
Byron Floyd: Yeah. And
Ryan Daniels: then we don't have to do deposit. Yeah, so technically we know we wouldn't have to.
Byron Floyd: Yeah, so I mean if we have to do a multiple line item, we could do it through QuickBooks. It doesn't mean we can't do both, right? What did
Ryan Daniels: you do for, what's that guy's name?
Byron Floyd: Dale.
Ryan Daniels: Dale? Did you put that as multiple or is that
Byron Floyd: just, uh, I just put fabrication deposit, but the full amount, it's
Ryan Daniels: all made of stuff, but we can put whatever you want.
Byron Floyd: Yeah.
Ryan Daniels: Yeah.
Byron Floyd: Yeah. Yeah. Cause you know, the breakdowns on the, on the contract, right. It's not, it doesn't have to be any invoice. Cause the breakdown of everything's on the contract. So, um, yeah,
Ryan Daniels: I don't think we would have a multiple
Byron Floyd: then. Yeah. So we technically could just send invoices right out of this if we wanted to. Yeah. So.
Ryan Daniels: I think that's it. I just don't get how we're avoiding the 1% if we were to still send it through QuickBooks. You know what I mean? Well,
Christian Sheerer: because
Byron Floyd: we'd
Christian Sheerer: be sending the actual information via QuickBooks, but they would have to click into that payment link. So Intuit sends a payment link itself, right?
Ryan Daniels: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: That's where they're taking a 1%.
Ryan Daniels: Oh, I get you now. Then you have your own personal. I think it'd be easier for, especially the older folks, Byron, if we just did it through Nickel.
Byron Floyd: Yeah.
Ryan Daniels: Through Nickel, yeah. Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: And they'll still see the QuickBooks like generated invoice PDF. Right. So that they know, oh, OK, this payment link is tied to this PDF, which has, you know, fabrication for this amount, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
Byron Floyd: You'd
Christian Sheerer: always add their contract in it, too, if you want to just be double sure. We could upload
Byron Floyd: the contract you're saying to the invoice as a PDF. Yeah,
Christian Sheerer: exactly. But yeah, exactly. I think I think, yeah, you're describing in the right way where it's like. it's as foolproof as it can be and you can send it to their phone uh if you want to um and that link will exist as long as the payment is open it's a it'll also exist once it's completed like they can go and click into the link and be like oh this has been paid awesome
Byron Floyd: okay cool cool we had we looked at we looked at something similar man i don't remember what that was or maybe i did but ryan i feel like a month or two ago was emilio or something But their way of paying is not. Everywhere else that we looked that had ACH payments that were low cost or free, like the customer had to like use Plaid to like connect their bank. And like it was just a pain. And QuickBooks was easy because you just put the routing and account number in. And that's what you guys do too, correct?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. And so there will be some Plaid verification for y'all.
Byron Floyd: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: And.
Byron Floyd: i
Christian Sheerer: think in the first instance they'll they'll have to link up with plaid just because we need to make sure we're not money laundering basically um
Byron Floyd: you're saying us or our customers
Christian Sheerer: the customer
Byron Floyd: okay
Christian Sheerer: yeah um but
Byron Floyd: the first time they pay they have to link up with bled
Christian Sheerer: yeah
Byron Floyd: okay so quickbooks doesn't do that they just put account number or routing number in and they pay it heard
Christian Sheerer: you yeah i think a small a small hitch to to make up for the one percent
Byron Floyd: yeah i know but you know the other part the part of it is is that We have to walk people through that and it takes up a lot of our time because a lot of people believe it or not. A lot of our customers are older buying expensive buildings.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. You
Byron Floyd: know.
Christian Sheerer: Okay. Well, I think,
Byron Floyd: do
Christian Sheerer: you have, do you have transactions that you, or like invoices that are going out soon that we can maybe with somebody who you have a little bit more trust with that we could troubleshoot that with?
Byron Floyd: I don't really, not maybe at the end of the week we will. I don't know. Is there any way to do like a test, a test version like to put?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, of course there is. Yeah, always. Yeah, you can always run a test one. I just say, yeah, sometimes I even say test for those real ones because it's like the real ones will work, right? We move, you know, $300,000 transaction. Yeah, no, I just.
Byron Floyd: I just want to know what it initially looks like with the plan. 100%.
Christian Sheerer: I mean, I get what you're
Byron Floyd: saying. Like, it is a small, I mean, if, you know, it is going to save us, you know, I mean, $5,000 a month is over $50,000. It's like $70,000 a year. So it's a lot of money, man.
Christian Sheerer: No, no, no. Exactly. So I would say go through it that way. Right? Like, I have sold software before where I have to tell people, hey, you know, you need to get ready to spend four weeks implementing it. You could. up and running this afternoon, like within an hour and a half, two hours, set everything up and send out those test transactions. And that's typically my like prescription of a next steps, right? Which is you get on.
Byron Floyd: The only thing that we're hung up on is like the plan stuff. Cause it's like, I understand that like, like I, you know, I've used plan, I use it all the time, But like you, I would say probably. i would go be willing to guess that 50 of our customers like maybe are going to be like what's this and how do i use it and what do i need to do yeah yeah and i and
Christian Sheerer: and it's not it's not ever it's few and far between it um it might just be for those larger transactions oh
Byron Floyd: i got you so it's not everybody
