Sterling Chipman: Good.
Christian Sheerer: I have Chiptax somebody else or is it you as well?
Sterling Chipman: No, Chiptax is my desktop, but the audio I don't really have set up great for the computer. It doesn't have audio. So that's why I got my phone.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, cool, cool, cool. No worries at all. As long as you can hear me and if I share my screen, you can see it.
Sterling Chipman: Yeah, Chiptax is just my desktop.
Christian Sheerer: Oh, yeah, you're good. Okay, cool.
Sterling Chipman: How's it going?
Christian Sheerer: Good. How are you doing?
Sterling Chipman: Doing well.
Christian Sheerer: Living the dream always. Staying busy, but better than. Better than sitting around and doing nothing. So I think typically. Where are you at? Where am I at? I'm in Brooklyn. Where are you?
Sterling Chipman: Brooklyn. Very cool. Utah. Salt Lake City.
Christian Sheerer: Cool. Awesome.
Sterling Chipman: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: I had a friend who lived out there and just moved back to Florida. I'm from Florida, and so. very different for him, but he was mentioning to me every weekend he would go ski and I was like, that's insane.
Sterling Chipman: Yeah. If you can work remotely and you like the outdoors, then it's a great option. Cool.
Christian Sheerer: Well, yeah, I think tell me a little bit more about how you found us and what on the payment side was irking you and kind of leading you to spend the Friday before Labor Day with somebody, a salesperson?
Sterling Chipman: Yeah, good question. So I just have been getting frustrated a little bit with my billing software called Mango Billing.
Christian Sheerer: Okay.
Sterling Chipman: Just the administrative amount of time that I have to spend with it and also just the fees. the fees have kind of gone up. They now charge since January one and a one and a quarter percent for any ACH transaction. So I'm just trying to run a more efficient business. And that's, it's an area of focus that I see that I would like to improve.
Christian Sheerer: Okay.
Sterling Chipman: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: With the 1.25 on, on, on ACH, what is that coming out to? So what's the kind of total volume on billing? of ACH a month?
Sterling Chipman: Let's see, we've had, I think, 80 to 90,000 year to date ACH. That's not all of the revenue. I have a lot of clients that they'll come in in person and they'll write checks. I took over this business from my dad and so he kind of ran things old school and did checks. Yeah. So.
Christian Sheerer: And is there, we hear that a lot from people in our industry. So story behind nickel is that we got started out as payments for industrial small businesses.
Sterling Chipman: Right.
Christian Sheerer: So people think building suppliers, manufacturers.
Sterling Chipman: People.
Christian Sheerer: That were doing large amounts of payments, like meaning, sorry, large payment amounts. And we were like, okay, if we can build like a payments infrastructure that's pretty lightweight to use and simple enough to kind of educate people to move away from check where they're writing like a $200,000 check and remove the fees, we're going to gain a lot of favor in that industry and then be able to spill out and become the primary way that businesses pay businesses, right? And so that's sort of what we do. And so as they, and so we hear a lot from people in those industries is similar to you that are taking over sort of like second generation of the business and trying to modernize it into the 21st century to get payments to be, you know, secure online rather than having to like drive checks back and forth to the bank. Is that also in your kind of field of vision?
Sterling Chipman: Yeah, I mean, I want to move more of that direction, but just the experience with the, with mango billing has. Been. To the, it's been to the degree that I think when I look back and I, I think like, okay, you know, I needed this to, because he had a, like a one. Like. A one-time application that he bought just to record profit, I guess, not QuickBooks, but just for bills that he wasn't paying annually for. And that seemed to work okay. So I don't know if I've really benefited if it's made me more efficient and I've, with the direction that I've gone. But yeah, the goal is to try to modernize, to make it things easier for the customers to also make it easier for me. I think in some ways it made it easier for the customers, but then there's a cost to that. so more than what we had before. So cool. I think I noticed on your website that, yeah, you guys seem to cater more towards, like, Builders, manufacturers, which tend to have, like, the fewer transactions and larger amounts. I'm trying to collect, I'd say like the average size there is like 700 bucks in in those 80 to $90,000. Of. ACH and credit card, but it's like 95% ACH.
Christian Sheerer: Got you.
Sterling Chipman: And.
Christian Sheerer: Is checks on top of that about the same or a little bit less than the 80?
Sterling Chipman: So we're total for like this year so far revenue wise we are like what was it I was looking the other day like 2 30 220 between 220 230. cool and.
Christian Sheerer: Around 700 so is that pretty even meaning is it 700 a month for services? So you're, you're looking at an average.
Sterling Chipman: Sorry, 700 is an average transaction size.
Christian Sheerer: Got you. And so you're looking at using nickel. So sometimes people, are you accountant for them as well?
Sterling Chipman: So, so, yeah, I'm a, I'm an enrolled agent, which is like a CPA. Have it, you know, it's a tax practice and. I just want a better way to get paid by my client. For you.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, I got you.
Sterling Chipman: For my business. Yeah, I know there's a lot of these solutions out there that are like, you know, they want, we are the referral or affiliate partner that provides like bill.com and some of these AR and AP services.
Christian Sheerer: And so you don't handle payments for your clients, you're just doing- We don't.
Sterling Chipman: Okay. We do the tax. We do the tax prep. We do some consulting, tax planning. And that's really the gist of it.
Christian Sheerer: Awesome. Okay, cool. Just because we do both, right? We can deal with your business one to one in that way. And then we also have a structure wherein people who are doing payments on the behalf of clients can set up a, we call it accountants account, but it's really like a parent account and then sub accounts for their clients within it where you can go go in and handle their AR and AP processes. But good to know that we're focused on shipment tax and the business particularly so I can show you around with that context in mind.
Sterling Chipman: And primarily receiving, outgoing, I probably have. Like. Five transactions outgoing and the rest are incoming per month.
Christian Sheerer: Got you. And how many per month are incoming?
Sterling Chipman: How many per month are incoming? Oh, yeah, like around oh, good question. I don't, I don't know. But we were doing, you know, between, anywhere between 15 to 40,000 a month, just depending on the time of year.
Christian Sheerer: So probably like, yes, so from like.
Sterling Chipman: I guess that's 25 to 30. I guess that's total income, not all through our mango going, but that's the potential.
Christian Sheerer: Cool, cool, cool, cool. Yeah, yeah, that's no, that's no issue for us. It would have been, I would have, we would have had a different conversation if you're like, hey, we're doing, you know, a thousand, thousands of transactions a month. But awesome.
Sterling Chipman: So I think we're probably doing like, you know, maybe like up to like 50, probably around like 50 transactions a month.
Christian Sheerer: And so are they usually recurring or right, like it's this, it's like 700 is like a retainer for, for, for one customer per month or is it one time invoice per customer?
Sterling Chipman: One time invoice per customer. And, you know, it's just whatever the work we do, we bill for it. My dad had a system where he would bill hourly and it would be like a line item description of the work done. So they'd say they could see, oh, this person worked on, you know, your tax return or did consulting this day for this amount of time at this rate. This is the total. And so that was I wanted to be able to do that so that clients, you know, could see the work that we were doing and felt like, you know, it was justified, especially when it's like something that's over multiple days or months. Where. It'S not all just tax prep, then it's helpful for the clients to see that the clients like to see that.
Christian Sheerer: And are those line item invoices, you're maintaining that system?
Sterling Chipman: That is Mango Billing that we use to do the line item detailed invoices.
Christian Sheerer: Okay. And then are you passing that to QuickBooks at all?
Sterling Chipman: No. Well, I mean, so when you say paths, there's not any sync between QuickBooks and Mango Billing. At least if they have it, I haven't integrated it. But it's just like a direct ACH deposit to the business bank account when they complete the little click to pay. Nice. From an email they receive. Nice.
Christian Sheerer: So it'll be similar. And you still use QuickBooks as the ERP for the business?
Sterling Chipman: I mean, I only use QuickBooks just to see my P&L.
Christian Sheerer: Okay.
Sterling Chipman: You know, when I'm doing taxes, my own taxes.
Christian Sheerer: Got you. Got you. Okay, cool.
Sterling Chipman: Well.
Christian Sheerer: If you want to sync those invoices, we completely can rip out mango billing and save you about the fifteen hundred dollars a year, two thousand dollars a year on that 1.25%. That was just like rough math times the 90, 000.
Sterling Chipman: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: If you wanted to have each invoice connected to QuickBooks, you could relink up with them super simply so that you could have real-time sync between both of them. And getting paid for each customer is super simple. I'll type up an invoice, I'll send it out to Chris myself. So this is me as Sterling, as my account, as the business. and I'll say, okay, monthly work on.
Sterling Chipman: Whatever.
Christian Sheerer: If it's a number or a description, you can drop in a note, you can upload a document that shows those hourly line items, right? Which is then getting tallied up into the total invoice amount, the 700 can do recurring, can do the one time, and then you can set a date of when it's supposed to be due.
Sterling Chipman: One question I ran into with, I was talking to forwardly yesterday to see if they were a fit and they said, hey, we're only business to business transactions.
Christian Sheerer: So not with us, people get paid from retail customers all the time.
Sterling Chipman: Okay. And you're able to do that because they told me they're like, sorry, they're like, the reason us and nobody can take ACH payments from just regular retail clients is because there's some regulation that specifies it can only be business to business.
Christian Sheerer: Well, that, yeah, I mean, ACH is just like the blanket term for how the FED moves money between banks and that's definitely just not Yeah, I mean, that might be a limitation on their end in the way that they're- I.
Sterling Chipman: Think as like a money, as a money services business or payment processor, it was something along those lines. So maybe it's like a state regulations, I'm not sure.
Christian Sheerer: Potentially, or the way that they have their kind of agreement set up with the banks, right? Because like we're moving money, but we're finance technology platform, we're not a bank yet. Um, and so like we have to abide by the deals that we, sketch with the banks. Anyway, long story short, millions of dollars moved, through us by like a retail customer who's just an individual paying a business, for example, paying like a, you know, a deck builder, paying a, coffee supplier, et cetera.
Sterling Chipman: So how does that work for you guys? Cause, you know, Mango billing saying, Hey, the administrative costs of ACH for us are they're getting too costly. We have to go from 1% last year to one and a quarter percent this year. Is it a lose, is it, do you lose, do you guys lose money on that side? Like with the just free ACH for with retail customers? So, and make it up, make it up.
Christian Sheerer: We have a pretty good deal. We have a pretty good deal with the way that we move money and we also We would charge for the subscription, right? So we're not losing money writ large. But yeah, we charge for the use of the platform, 35 bucks a month. We don't charge for ACH, but when we move, you know, so if I send this link out, I'll give, you know, my customer both options to pay, whether it's via card or ACH. I'll send it out to them and then I can show you what it looks like on their end. So I just sent that invoice. And I'll go in to my email and I'll see, okay, cool. So I'm the customer now. I got this payment from or this invoice from DeGraaf Distribution, and I'll see other unpaid invoices I have, and I can see a different link, right? So it's a one-to-one link for each invoice so that we're not co-mingling funds. And if I go in and pay by card, they'll be charged 2.99% on the card bit.
Sterling Chipman: And it's okay, so then, so it'll pass, it'll show the customer that you're passing or that I'm passing on the fees for if they want to pay by card. So it's like, hey, you have this option, but you're going to pay 299%.
Christian Sheerer: Exactly. And you can manipulate that so that if on a per customer basis or if you want to eat the fees for all the customers, you can. but the default is to pass it on.
Sterling Chipman: Okay. Got it. Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: And then they'll, so, you know, assuming.
Sterling Chipman: That it goes above 2.99 and is Amex accepted?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, even Amex is 2.99.
Sterling Chipman: Oh, it is. Okay. Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: So it doesn't go above. That's our cap. flat.
Sterling Chipman: And so it just stays the same for every, no matter what card the customer is using.
Christian Sheerer: Precisely.
Sterling Chipman: And there's a per transaction fee probably a few cents on that?
Christian Sheerer: Well, it's 2.99% or it's just the.
Sterling Chipman: Percentage and that's it? Yeah. Okay, because I've seen a lot of these processors where they charge the percentage plus like, you know, a few cents per transaction is on top of that.
Christian Sheerer: Nope, yeah, yeah, just 2.99% on the card.
Sterling Chipman: Got it.
Christian Sheerer: And people are pretty happy to pay it because of all the benefits they get by using their card. It's quicker turnaround too, so one day turnaround versus two days for ACH. And then all those active invoices I'll see is like outstanding, they'll pay it out pretty much here they have a balance, right, of 700. It's due in 60 days. So, you know, might check in on that as it's going out. I can also send reminders. If I didn't get a payment on time, I'll see that it's overdue. And then I'll also see all the completed ones.
Sterling Chipman: Where does it show that it's overdue?
Christian Sheerer: Right here.
Sterling Chipman: Oh, okay. All right.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, you can sort by all of these fields.
Sterling Chipman: Okay, got it. Yeah. If a payment fails, if somebody punches in the wrong ACH, because I've had that on a few and then it's just like almost impossible to reverse, how does that, how is that handled?
Christian Sheerer: Well, they'll get a notification. So a customer notification will get, they'll get one when they make a payment, cool, you got a receipt, awesome. And you can CC yourself to see. Or if it's failed, they'll see that too. And we'll get notified and you'll get notified as well.
Sterling Chipman: Because with Mango Billing, the way it happens is the minute they type in a routing and account number, it'll. Show. They'Ll get an email saying, Hey, this is paid. But then I had this lady that says, Hey, I know I put in the wrong account number. like, for sure. And so it's going to be rejected. But the client would still get a email saying, hey, this is paid. And then it would be several days later, like five days later or a week later, sometimes that I would get an email saying, hey, you were not paid.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, well, we won't clear it. We'll get real-time notifications and we won't clear it. We won't pull it from their account if they don't have sufficient funds in the account. And we won't send a notification that you've gotten paid unless we've pulled it from their account and then it's also been sent to you. So like we'll pull, you know, the day that it's sent and we won't notify you that it's been paid until it's been paid and settled.
Sterling Chipman: Does the client get like a payment receipt right away or does it wait or is it once it's confirmed, like that I'm actually winning the money.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, once it's confirmed, they'll get a notification that they've made the payment. Like they'll get a, hey, you got you, not a notification, but there will be on the screen, hey, you've made the payment.
Sterling Chipman: So no separate email?
Christian Sheerer: No separate email until they, until it gets paid out.
Sterling Chipman: Oh, okay. So that. Got it. So not until the money comes out of their account, do they get the email saying, hey, it's paid. Okay, got it. That's better.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, and I mean, that's really as simple as it is on the AR side. And then you can track all of these in real time. If you're using QuickBooks, you can pull them into QuickBooks, but you could also just go in and see all those transactions on receivables, download them via CSV, see which account it's going into.
Sterling Chipman: Who.
Christian Sheerer: It'S from, any notes on the invoice.
Sterling Chipman: Any.
Christian Sheerer: There might also be like a PDF that you added, right, for that contract.
Sterling Chipman: Okay. I'm just trying to think, how can I make this work practically? Because as far as, you know, a system where I can have people that work remote enter their time, enter their description for what they've worked on, I would still need some other system for that, right?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, it's so...
Sterling Chipman: This would be... Yeah, I want to have a complete solution for capturing and recording time and creating detailed invoices for employees.
Christian Sheerer: No, I think my suggestion would be to do that through QuickBooks.
Sterling Chipman: In QuickBooks?
Christian Sheerer: Or you could realistically do it in Mango. I don't know how much you pay them. I do only pay for the, they're.
Sterling Chipman: Like 30 per payment. I think I'm paying $35 per month per year.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, if you're already paying, like 90, I think you could create those invoices, have them sync to Nickel and then just use Nickel to send out the payments as it get paid on that invoice.
Sterling Chipman: Sorry, what was that?
Christian Sheerer: If you're already paying QuickBooks, I would use, sorry, I would use QuickBooks. to create those invoices, have them sync in real time to Nickel, and then use Nickel to send out the invoice to get paid.
Sterling Chipman: That might be the best solution. I would have to see though. I don't think QuickBooks is very great when it comes to just like recording time. I know they have it. I just haven't looked into it. I like a good time tracking system. And ultimately, like, I don't want to be tied to charging clients by time on an hourly rate, necessarily. I'd prefer for it to be like, you know, a base fee, like flat fee for the, for a certain kind of work. And then based on some other variables, or, you know, complexity, it could go up from there. But.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, I mean, I think then if you're transitioning to that sort of system, then we are aligned perfectly for the time being on that hourly basis. I would suggest, I mean, I know you'd probably have to track it. And so Mango billing has like tracking time tracking where you click and oh, this is out and then it tracks you did two hours times the hourly rate.
Sterling Chipman: Well, what they. It's. It's just manual entry, so it's like. So the way I do it now, I just. This is why it's just. It feels like a lot of administrative time goes into this. I have just a. Like a weekly planner where I'll write down, okay, you know, if I'm working on somebody, how much time I spent on them. And then, you know, I don't have enough space to always write what I did, but I can write a little something and then I just try to capture it quickly. So I still, it's still in my mind, the work that I did. Take. It from the notebook, put it into Mango billing and I'll, you know, find the client. I look up the client, I put the details, the date, what I worked on. the hours and then I have a set rate for it's different for me versus the other people that work on my team. And then once that time is in there, it's work in progress, then I can go to create an invoice from that and I can do different types of formats. So I could do like a narrative display, narrative invoice where It doesn't show all the line item details, but typically when it's more involved work, because, you know, if I just, I'm going to charge a client $3,000 and there's just a 10-word description for a lot of clients that, you know, they might push back on that, or they, if they don't understand the work that was actually done, like, and why it took how much time it took, then I just want to avoid those sort of conversations where there's pushback from clients on billing.
Christian Sheerer: Of course, yeah. And you can always add in, I think, I mean, yeah, we don't have a time tracking feature, but you can always add in that invoice as a document in whatever way you're corralling it and pulling it into nickel at some weekly or whatever cadence that you're doing it and attaching that to the invoice. So that's my suggestion in using QuickBooks because I think they have a pretty good way of like corralling those line items that you can make out on an invoice. Whether you're connecting it with your planning, if that's a software or you're just moving that into it manually, I would say create it there, it would sync over to Nickel and then Nickel is like the way that you get paid.
Sterling Chipman: The other maybe option would be they're just not great. They're good for short bills. My tax software called Pro Series in it, I can just put like a pretty short description. It's hard to do it, it's hard to do it like by line and say, okay, this is the cost tied to this line item or the work done this day. It's not really great for that, but I can put a, I do it for, we call it Quick Bills, where, you know, I can create a PDF from my tax software and that's great for when I'm in person with clients and it's work that's not done over multiple days or it's, you know, they. Know. You know, clearly the work that was done and the value that's there and I don't have to put a long description. It's really when it's over multiple days and more work is involved that I have to do the, or I feel the need to do the line item detail just because sometimes I have had clients where I'll give the short little narrative and they say, hey, like this doesn't make, like this doesn't make sense to me. or they think it's, they're being overcharged and they want it to be explained. And so then it takes some explaining, which is where we need the more detailed line item. That's, you know, that's not everybody. If it's a simple tax return, then we don't need that. We do the quick bill. So I guess the point there is, you know, maybe, I don't know, but maybe I could, it wouldn't work for 100 of clients, but, you know, it works for. you know, all those that come in person and we knock the tax return out while they're in person. Those I could just, I guess, create the invoice in nickel and send it, send them an email and they just punch in their information on the spot if they're not going to write a check, and then it's free ACH and money's deposited as long as funds are available, right? So just thinking through how it could save me time.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, I think it also saves you that $1,500 a month or a year, sorry.
Sterling Chipman: Without having to kind of piece together multiple systems. I'm trying to simplify. I'm trying to simplify, streamline and save costs. Like this admin stuff around billing is kind of a big headache for me. And then I just don't like seeing these surprise fees. You know, ACH, there's all these services where it is free, but then I just haven't found something that I could do ACH where it works for me and. I'm not eating fees on that.
Christian Sheerer: Well, it's free to get started. I think my suggestion would be if you want to run a couple test transactions through Nickel and try to link it up with that workflow, one for the way you'll have to track the hourly line by line items versus the one where it's just like a set transaction amount, then I think that would be a good place to start. And if then that ends up working out, then you can upgrade to the Nickel+ where it's the 35 a month if you've found like a kind of a streamlined way to push all those things together.
Sterling Chipman: So do you guys have like a free version and then like a 35 a month version? Is that the plan?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, the reason people pay for the 35 a month is if they're doing transactions that are above 25,000 per transaction.
Sterling Chipman: Above 25,000. Oh, gotcha. I see. So I guess one question I have is just how many I know you have four accountants, but that's a little bit different than that's for their for the accountant's clients more so, right?
Christian Sheerer: Yes, for accountants who are handling AR and AP for their clients.
Sterling Chipman: Yeah. I guess I'd be curious to know how has your soft, do you have any examples or clients where it's the accountant using it just for their business to receive payment from like tax prep clients? I'd be curious to know like how they've implemented it. I don't know if there's anybody who you can think of that would be willing to talk to that, that I could talk to, but that would be of interest. Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: I could look into it. I don't know off the top of my head. I joined a couple months ago and I haven't dealt with many. It's not necessarily like the bulk of our customers. And so, yeah, there's a way you can kind of hack it together that'll allow you to, without too much time, because it's really just as simple as going like we did a sending of an invoice in two minutes. And so if you're just pulling that invoice in a way that you're linking out the line items, attaching it as a PDF so that somebody can read it when they're going to pay you the $700, then, you know, it's not too much added time there. And, and so short answer is, I don't know off the top of my head, somebody who I've dealt with personally, who I could ask. But I think if it is an added system, it's probably one that adds like two minutes at the benefit of taking away those 1.25% in fees, which add up to around $1,000 a year.
Sterling Chipman: I think my challenge is going to be if I'm using multiple systems and then clients, I'm going backwards in time and saying, okay, because this Like we're unfortunately not just up to date and current on all the billing. It drags out because tax season gets crazy. And so I focus on doing the work, recording the work, and then sometimes four or five months later, I'm going back and looking at the time, what was done, and trying to put together a bill. And then there's other times where it's like, we've sent a client a bill and it's been, you know, six, seven months, sometimes a year, and they haven't paid it. And just being able to kind of go back in time and get clear visibility on those things. I think one of the challenges for me is going to be if I'm using multiple systems, like where can I have just clear visibility into, okay, who's, you know, accounts receivable, who's paid me, who's not, who still needs to. Be. Billed that hasn't been billed. So. If everything, if I think. I. Could start with the nickel core and just start to play around with it.
Christian Sheerer: And see yeah, you'll still be able to see all of the customers, what invoices are out to them. If there's active invoices, how much is on their balance, how much has been paid out, and then you'll also be able to see all completed invoices, all scheduled future ones, all active, meaning ones that have been sent out and are awaiting to get paid. So you'll still have the visibility there.
Sterling Chipman: What about, like, I mean, operating as a little bit as a CRM? you know, we're right.
Christian Sheerer: No, yeah. So we're not necessarily a CRM.
Sterling Chipman: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: I mean, yeah, it's payment software.
Sterling Chipman: I guess. How could I get, I guess, the best way to track. Oh, do you guys help just with. So onboarding, like importing all the clients, like name, email. Address.
Christian Sheerer: If that stuff's in QuickBooks, you can do it live. We would do it on a case-by-case basis, but frankly, it requires a lot of engineering time and there's very limited when we do that.
Sterling Chipman: You guys have limited resource to help with that.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, yeah, exactly.
Sterling Chipman: I would think so.
Christian Sheerer: It should take honestly, maybe a day to pull in all those customers. And if you had them in QuickBooks less than an hour.
Sterling Chipman: I have them, I can pull all that data from either Mango Billing or from my tax software is where I'd have it. I don't have that information in QuickBooks.
Christian Sheerer: Okay. Yeah, I think. I mean, let me see if you.
Sterling Chipman: Can just still do CSV it. You. You could.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, I mean, that would just be. You just have to add the. The customers yourself.
Sterling Chipman: Okay, maybe. maybe I could hop on in. You guys could, is that something you guys could just like say, hey, we'll just help you get started and then you go from there?
Christian Sheerer: I would have to, like, frankly, based on what we're looking at as a revenue opportunity is probably something our engineering team would not do.
Sterling Chipman: Okay. Yeah, fair enough. I just thought I'd ask.
Christian Sheerer: No, of course.
Sterling Chipman: Okay, well, I. I mean, I think you guys have a great solution that's solving a need in the market, and I think it could potentially work for me, but it's going to require probably some manual work on my end, just on the front end and making sure all systems are happy and working together.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, I'll do this. I'll send you a recap of, like, what we chatted about and point out where you can get. started. And so free to get started on the core side. And so, yeah, I think you'll be saving that money on the back end. And if you like, I think the level of manual work, it will be more than paid for by saving on that 1.25%.
Sterling Chipman: Yeah, I think you're right. Agreed.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, cool. Yeah, I'll send that over and then I'll drop my contact in the case you want to have another check-in to work through like troubleshooting any of that stuff that happened on the front end. And yeah, we'll also like recurrently drop notes about new features that we have when, you know, it might be relevant to your use case.
Sterling Chipman: And you guys, I think you pointed out you can set up like retainer or recurring billing. Mm-. Yeah. I think. I. Like what I understand so far. So. Better than some of the others I've seen.
Christian Sheerer: Awesome.
Sterling Chipman: Yeah. Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: No, I'm proud of the product, too. I didn't build it, but I like, I I like talking about it.
Sterling Chipman: Yeah. So I don't want to take, you know, more of your time, but I guess the back, you kind of shared a little bit, the backstory. But I guess how long have you guys been around?
Christian Sheerer: About three years.
Sterling Chipman: About three years. Cool. All right, well, yeah, I'll, if you send me a recap, that'd be great.
Christian Sheerer: Awesome. Yeah, it'll have clear login instructions and all that stuff, and then hopefully a good summary of how you would piece it into what you guys are currently doing.
Sterling Chipman: Oh, you guys are using Grasshopper Bank? Yeah. I started using about a year and a little over two years ago, Grasshopper Bank with you. You're there in Brooklyn, so you might know meow.
Christian Sheerer: I don't know them, but I bet they do. Oh, yeah. Is it a company?
Sterling Chipman: Yeah. And so they're supposed. They want to be the Costco of financial services, and so. it was like treasury management and, you know, they were some smart guys found them on X or Twitter and they've just, you know, built out like pretty good solid treasury management and, yeah, like financing for founders. So I was using them, but yeah, they use Grasshopper and It's better than like any of these other high yield checking accounts is like 4. something percent just on a regular business bank account.
Christian Sheerer: Sick.
Sterling Chipman: Yeah. So kind of a funny name, you know? Yeah. M-E-O-W. But yeah, they've been good so far. Cool.
Christian Sheerer: I'll get that out to you today and let me know how everything goes in the setup.
Sterling Chipman: All right. Hey, thanks a lot.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, no problem. Nice to meet you.
Sterling Chipman: Hey, have a great weekend.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, you too. Have a good Labor Day.
Sterling Chipman: Take care.
