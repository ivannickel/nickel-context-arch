Ariel: Hey, can you hear me? Hello?
Christian Sheerer: Hello?
Ariel: Can you hear me?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, yeah, it was just a little bit quiet before, so I'd turn up my volume. I'm sorry.
Ariel: How's it going?
Christian Sheerer: Good, how are you?
Ariel: Good, good. Smooth day. High percent, Ilya is also here. I'll be more on mute, I'll be on mute.
Christian Sheerer: Awesome. Yeah, glad to meet you both. Fill me in, yeah. What made you guys wanna spend your time with a salesperson?
Ariel: So at a high level, we're working on a platform targeted at New York City taxi companies. To pay out their independent contractors, which are taxi drivers. Where, I guess, just to walk you through the, the payment flow, it's the taxi company is going to give us their trips. We're going to price out all of their trips, determine which drivers need to be paid a certain amount and disperse payments out from hopefully the taxi driver's company bank account and push it on over to the driver's bank account. And we're pretty much on the market looking for a provider that allows us to move the money, essentially. And we're trying to see whether or not nickel could meet our needs. Okay.
Christian Sheerer: I think I have an idea. You guys, are you moving any money today?
Ariel: No. Okay.
Christian Sheerer: Do you have a sense of like the scope?
Ariel: By scope you mean customers?
Christian Sheerer: Payment volume?
Ariel: We have one company lined up along with two other ones. Ilya could confirm there. I guess he's busy. Yeah, so we have definitely one in the pipeline. We're currently in the process of finishing up with our MVP and just moving on to the next phase of integrating with provider that allows us to do the transfer of funds.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, so what we are set up to do with the regulatory environment that we're kind of immersed in viS-A-Vis our banks, the Federal Reserve, et cetera, is we have to be connected to both the merchant and the end user. So we don't, API into other payment platforms, I guess is the way to describe it, wherein they would be moved.
Ariel: Through.
Christian Sheerer: You corralling that and then pushing it out. We're sort of prohibited from interacting with independent service vendors is like the term of art that we can't API into where they would process payments through A-R-I-G and then use us as like the back end payments mover.
Ariel: Okay, understood. Any chance, you know, based off of what I've told you thus far, any way we could make something work, perhaps not the way that I've Illustrated it, but not sure how you guys interact with your customers.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, so typically our customers are sending invoices directly to their customers or to their vendors. Do AP and AR. And so then we're connecting both the end merchant, I guess, and the end user or the end customer of that merchant, and we're sitting in the middle there. The only way that this would work and I will probably get shot down by engineering team is if we set you up with an account wherein you would handle all of the end users paying your end merchants, if that makes sense. We have a situation that sometimes accountants use us to manage their clients AR and AP. And so we could set it up that way, but that's likely not going to be something without proof of like, you know, verifiable payment volume that we would build out.
Ariel: Today. Got it. Okay. Any chance you know of any other payment providers that could potentially support our use case?
Christian Sheerer: I don't know. I mean, Stripe. I don't know, really. I don't know.
Ariel: Okay. Yeah. No, we've explored Stripe, but their pricing is pretty hefty.
Christian Sheerer: So, yeah, part of the reason that we can do the pricing that we do is because we're connected to the payments at the end.
Ariel: Yeah. Okay. Yep. We're for a try. Just trying to see if perhaps you guys could have, you know, helped us out there, but, yeah, I appreciate your time, then.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, no worries. Yeah. Sorry. I wouldn't want to drag you guys along and, like, kind of think through this super heavily. I am pretty sure it just, like, wouldn't be a good fit. So down the line, if things do change, I mean, we'll keep you in contact and. And we'll try to push you some stuff that. Hey, you know, we'll make notes in our CRM. Hey, this might be a good fit now.
Ariel: Thank you, Christian.
Christian Sheerer: Oh, no worries. Sorry.
Ariel: Thank you.
Christian Sheerer: Have a good one.
