Colton O'Farrell: . . . . . . .
Hassan Niazi: Okay. Sure.
Colton O'Farrell: How's it going today?
Hassan Niazi: Good. How are you?
Colton O'Farrell: Doing really well. Thanks so much for making some time to hop on this call. So really just to give a little bit of background, my name is Colton. I work on the sales team here at Nickel. I know my colleague Matt had reached out to you and you were interested in learning a little bit more about how you could pay your vendors via Nickel if they don't have an account. So I'll definitely be showing you that today and we'll also be sending you $50 via Nickel just to show how easy it is to pay your vendors. But would love to learn more about your business, what you have going on in terms of AR and AP process, what kind of systems you're using, and if there's any kind of problems or challenges with what you have existing today.
Hassan Niazi: Yes, we are a shipping company. We ship vehicles. Majority of my shipments are vehicles. I do ship vehicles from Hawaii to California and the rest of the vehicles from mainland, from California, Texas, Georgia, New Jersey, going to overseas. When it comes to payment, I do have drivers that they drop vehicles for me from point A to these states that I mentioned, to the loading facilities that I have in each state, like in California, we have Oakland and we have Los Angeles, Texas, we have Houston, Georgia, we have Savannah. So as soon as they drop the vehicle, they need to get paid on the spot. We do use Zelle, but it's limited to a couple thousand. At the moment, I don't have much paying to the drivers, but I'm going to start to expand the business on December, usually possibly.
Colton O'Farrell: Exciting.
Hassan Niazi: I do use Deluxe online check.
Colton O'Farrell: What was that service you used today?
Hassan Niazi: Zell. I do use Zell. And additionally, I do use Deluxe e-check okay. U-L-D-E-L-U-X I think, if I'm not mistaken, it's an e-check we can pay our vendors, but the problem we're facing is these drivers, they're all the school. They don't have, most of them, they don't have email, they don't know how.
Colton O'Farrell: To use.
Hassan Niazi: Echeck and some of them, they don't even trust eCheck. So the, the, the best way to get paid is Zelle or a check on the spot. We don't have a check at that loading as those loading facilities because those are not my own. I use a third party. They just receive vehicles for me and they do loading.
Colton O'Farrell: But.
Hassan Niazi: Now with nickel, am I able to pay my vendors?
Colton O'Farrell: Yes. And very easily. So I'll definitely do that.
Hassan Niazi: Because again, they don't, they don't want to take the time to go through, make creating an account.
Colton O'Farrell: They don't have to create an account with us. All they have to do is link how they would like to get that payment. So if they want to receive it via ACH in their account. They would simply add their routing and account number in a secure link that we would send them. They would just fill that out one time and the system would remember it. Otherwise, we could also we could mail them a check if you'd like to. There's an option for them to select either ACH or via check. Obviously, if they're going to send a check, there's a that will increase kind of the time from when they get paid. There's also a $2 check fee. But if they do the ACH processing option, that will hit their account in. One to two business days.
Hassan Niazi: You see, this is the problem we're facing. Like I mentioned, they drop the vehicle. They will not drop it. First of all, they need to get paid on the spot. We're using Zell payment because Zell is instant. They get it within a second. And once they confirm the payment, then they'll move forward to drop the vehicle for us. Do you have any any solution that they could get paid within a matter of second.
Colton O'Farrell: So my recommendation would be just to send that payment slightly in advance and they would hit their account.
Hassan Niazi: Yeah, I cannot do that. I don't trust them and they don't trust me in this transaction.
Colton O'Farrell: I mean, I know with Zelle it for that to hit their account, are you paying an additional fee to get that process even faster?
Hassan Niazi: No, Zelle is like without any fee, instant payment. But Zelle is not for business. Zelle is for a person.
Colton O'Farrell: Personal, yep. Well, let me do this, Hassan. Let me just show you how Nickel can work. I'm going to show you what it would look like on the customer side and it will list everything on the accounts payable side, like the timeframe and how that all works. But let me do that. I'm going to send you a quick email here. So I'm going to go ahead and share my screen first.
Hassan Niazi: And I'm going to send you an.
Colton O'Farrell: Email to set you up as a vendor, just to show you how easy and simple it is to get paid via Nickel. So this is logging into the Nickel platform here. So we're going to go to the bill pay here. I'm going to go to vendors, and I'm going to simply add you as a new vendor. What I'm going to do is I don't have your information, but if you had this, these individuals contact information, you could simply add it yourself. Could add what kind of, You you would know, simply if add it's how a they business, like to if be paid it's or a contractor, if you don't have freelancer, that information like I don't have yours, we can send you a form to fill out. So all I need to do is enter your name and your email. So I'm going to go ahead and do that. But you'll be getting an email here in just a moment. All right. So we got that. This is the email that I will send the vendor setup form. But you'll get an email here in just a moment. It will ask you to confirm the payout method. And once you're done, I'll go ahead and send a bill to you or to I'll go ahead and pay a bill to you. So if you want to just let me know when you get that. And I would recommend selecting the ACH option just so we can show you how quickly that will hit your account.
Hassan Niazi: Spell out vendor detail. Click on this one.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep.
Hassan Niazi: Okay, so now get it started.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep.
Hassan Niazi: Business address, email, next step, delivery via ACH checking.
Colton O'Farrell: I would select the ACH option.
Hassan Niazi: Delivery via transfer ACH.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep.
Hassan Niazi: Okay, routing and let me see. Routing number. Let me see.
Colton O'Farrell: Give.
Hassan Niazi: Me a second. Yeah, no worries. Your time.
Colton O'Farrell: Okay. So.
Hassan Niazi: The right thing. Okay, it's done, I think.
Colton O'Farrell: All set? Cool. Yes. All right, so I'm going to go ahead and pay a bill then to you quick. So we're going to just look up your name. Got you right there. What are we paying you? $50 for your time. Demo. And I'm going to go ahead and make the payment. So here is the timeframe. So we can do same day processing. So right now, if we were to pay you with a credit card on the accounts payable side, there is a 2.9% processing fee. We handle the PCI compliance, so your customer only gets that net amount. But if we were to switch to ACH, there's no fee on that. It does increase the ACH processing time. So ACH is always free for all of our customers. It will just take one business day for that to be processed. It would hit their account the next day. But again, if you use a credit card, we will get that to them same day. So I'm going to do it the same day just to show you how quick we can get that process. I'm going to go ahead and hit review pay transferring it to that Bank of America account. I'm going to add a note. I'm on. Thank you for your time today. I'm going to go ahead and pay that. Oh, I think I have to use my separate card. Sorry. I think this card is an outdated one. Let me just go ahead and use the the bank. I guess the the credit card that I have on file is isn't working, but we'll just go ahead and use the the bank account. So that will be a one day transfer time to you. But if you again, you use a credit card, it will be that same day.
Hassan Niazi: So I have a question. If I use the credit card to pay my vendors, how soon they can receive it?
Colton O'Farrell: Same day.
Hassan Niazi: How many hours or second will take them to see it?
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, so as long as the payment gets so for credit cards, they can happen instantaneous. It's going to be the same day. I can try to get more information on the specific time frame. I just know it hits the account same day for ACH processing. We are required to meet the bank cutoff time of our sponsor bank, which is 4:00 PM Eastern Standard Time. So as long as you get the payments for ACH, generally it's a can be same day to two day on our subscription plan. or on the Nickel Core Plan, which is our free plan, it's generally two to three day turnaround time for ACH. But again, if you're doing that credit card, it will be same day. And this is just like a PDF receipt that I'll email so you have that for your records as well. But if I were to pay you via the credit card, it would have hit your account the same day. So it can really meet the need for what your drivers are looking for and the vendors who are transporting your.
Hassan Niazi: Vehicles to those other Okay.
Colton O'Farrell: States. Yeah, I was curious, Hassan, so this is more on the accounts payable side. Accounts receivable, how is that working for you today? Are you issuing invoices to your customers via email? Are they paying you via credit card, via ACH? How is that process working for you?
Hassan Niazi: I get paid via check, ACH, cash, and wire transfer.
Colton O'Farrell: Okay.
Hassan Niazi: I don't accept credit card.
Colton O'Farrell: You don't accept credit card? Is that related to the fees?
Hassan Niazi: Not really, but related to bounce size, this of the payments. Charges that we had in the past. Once we released the cargo, If they dispute the charges, it's hard for us.
Colton O'Farrell: To.
Hassan Niazi: Essentially, to get that payment again. We don't want to go through the headache.
Colton O'Farrell: Right.
Hassan Niazi: So we have to get paid check, cash or wire transfer.
Colton O'Farrell: Do you get charged for those payment methods? For like the ACH, for wire transfers, what are you paying for that?
Hassan Niazi: For wire transfer, I don't pay.
Colton O'Farrell: I don't have to receive at least.
Hassan Niazi: Come again?
Colton O'Farrell: You don't pay to receive wire transfers just to issue them? No. Got it. And for ACH, are you having to pay like a 1% fee or any kind of charges when it comes to that?
Hassan Niazi: No payment.
Colton O'Farrell: Okay, nice. I was curious, what's the system of record or ERP you're operating on? QuickBooks. Is it QuickBooks Desktop or QuickBooks Online? QuickBooks Online.
Hassan Niazi: Nice.
Colton O'Farrell: So we actually have a native integration with QuickBooks Online. Like 98% of our customers use them to connect your QuickBooks account. It's super simple. You just go to account settings you'd here, go to integrations right here and click this link QuickBooks account button. This would bring a little pop-up window. You'd sign in with your username, your password, and you'd go ahead and link your QuickBooks account. Once you do that, everything from your all of your customers, all of your vendors, all of your bills, all of your invoices, everything flows into Nickel. So this is the accounts payable side here. This is the accounts receivable side to once you're connected with toggle QuickBooks, on if you'd like. So we my also account's have some automation not actually connected that you could to a QuickBooks account because it's just a demo account. But if you were, what you would see would be something similar to this. So it would say Alibaba Global Shipping Company. It would have your QuickBooks number there. But there would be this automation to turn on if you'd like. What this would do is anytime you create an invoice in QuickBooks Online, instead of sending that via QuickBooks on any ACH and having that to are pay sent because via QuickBooks QuickBooks, has a 1% we would fee automatically send that via Nickel instead. So when your customer receives that, if they want to pay via ACH, there would be no fee for either you or your customers. And if they want to pay via credit card, they can. You can disable all credit cards if you'd like, but by default, 100% of the credit card surcharge will be paid for by your customer. The reason it wouldn't be good to have this toggled is on if you are like in certain scenarios, our customers, it works great for them to have it toggled on. But if you're having to generate an invoice, go into it, make revisions, modifications, change it a lot, we would recommend having that turned off because if you do that, each time you would make an adjustment, that would be sent to your customer. So that's the only caveat there. But let's say, for example, that this was turned off like it is in this picture here. To send those invoices via Nickel would be extremely easy. you just come over to the get paid tab, you'd go over here to payment requests, you select request payment, we'll send this secure hyperlink either via email or via SMS to them. You would hit send, it would be sent email and they would simply click pay now, there would be an option to pay via credit card or to pay via ACH. And I'll show you what that looks like so you can get a idea of it. But the global settings right are in account settings right here, this is where you're going to find you'll have complete control over credit card surcharge management. So if a customer wants to pay via credit card, by default, 100% of that cost will be paid for by your customer. However, this is a global rule. So if you have an agreement with your customers that you want to split those card payments, you can do that.
Hassan Niazi: If they pay me by credit card and dispute the payment, there is no possibility for me to stop that.
Colton O'Farrell: So we do have all the transactions listed here. So we have receivables, payables, refunds, returns and chargebacks. At Nickel, we help our customers vet customers and really how we work. And one of the reasons a lot of customers love us is because of the built-in fraud protection we have. With Nickel, we have our own bank account that we are quickly able to issue payments to you and to your customers. And then we're the ones getting it on the back end there. So I wouldn't be so worried about that in particular. But if you were, you can go on any individual invoice and you can go ahead, go to settings, you could disable credit card payments just like that. And that the rule that I was showing you by default, 100% of the credit card fee is paid for by your customers. That's a global rule, but you can also override it.
Hassan Niazi: You mentioned that you guys have your own bank account?
Colton O'Farrell: We have our own sponsor bank. Yep. Okay, so we're able to provide completely free ACH for all of our customers up to a million dollars per transaction.
Hassan Niazi: Nice. I'll go through this payment method, but I don't think so. This would be a good payment method for me.
Colton O'Farrell: Can I understand why?
Hassan Niazi: Like I said, my clients are all the school. I send them the invoice to check their email. They don't do it. They call me, they ask me to send them the invoice on WhatsApp or.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, well, I'm happy to show. So in addition to, so I'm going to just show you what it looks like on if I were to send one of these. So we'll just create a new invoice quickly just to show you what it looks like. If you brought it in from QuickBooks Online, you would just have to send it. But if I'm going to go ahead and just generate a new invoice here, We'll just call this 146-730-25. What is the typical invoice range that you're issuing?
Hassan Niazi: Starting at 1350 to 6700-8000. It depends on the shipping.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, we'll do one of the bigger ones there. So we'll do this as a one-time payment. I'll just put a quick note. Hi Colton, please make the payment. Soon as possible, we'll grab all of your QuickBooks invoices and any attachments will be automatically brought into Nickel. But because I'm generating this myself within the platform, I'm just going to attach like a sample invoice here. So added that right there. When I hit create, we're generating that secured payment link. This will be sent via email to your customer. You can also just copy that link and open it in a new tab. If you were curious what that looked So your like, customer, here's when they me get doing the email that just like and so. hit pay now, this is the screen they'll get. So I'll show you in the demo or in my inbox. So here's that invoice I just generated. It says your company, your logo, you have a new payment request, the amount, invoice is attached. If your customer has questions and they reply to the email, you would be CC'd on communication. And when they hit that pay now button, this again is where they have the option to pay via card. There's they would that just 2.99% enter their card fee. information and hit pay or if they want to pay with no fee via their bank and ACH, they would simply select that option, enter the routing and account number and hit pay. We also set up all of our customers with a merchant payment link. So that's right here. Most of our customers will take this link and they'll embed it in their website. This can serve as a one stop shop for customers to make any kind of payment. So I'll just do a quick example there. So if they wanted to come into your website, make a payment, they could pay by card with that fee or they could pay for free with ACH. What some of our customers do is they will actually take this payment link right here. They will copy and paste it into so you could generate a QR code. So if you go to like QR.io, you could take that link, copy it, paste it in here and generate a QR code. So I've actually already done that. I'll just grab a sample of that quick. So if you took out your phone and you scan this link, it is going to or this QR code, it's going to bring you to that payment portal that I just showed you. A lot of our customers will just have this on their phone to be able to be paid on job sites. We will be rolling out our own mobile app at the end of this year that will have some built-in payment functionality, but this is also just another solution that all of our customers get set up with.
Hassan Niazi: Okay.
Colton O'Farrell: And I'm happy to just quickly kind of COVID pricing just to explain that. So pricing with us is really straightforward and easy. We essentially have two plans. We have the Nickel Core Plan, which is our completely free plan. There's no subscription cost here. The only way that you would pay any kind of fees here is if you were to be eating some of the credit card surcharge from your customers or if you were paying bills with credit cards, in which case there would be that 2.9% fee. But otherwise, there is no fees associated with the Nickel Core Plan. It allows for three active members. You can do up to $25,000 per ACH transaction. So that's not cumulative, meaning you could do 100 of those. You just cannot do one at $26,000. You get access to that payment portal link that I just showed you. Some limitations, though, are that you cannot schedule payments or do reoccurring payments. The ACH processing time for the free plan is generally two to three day turnaround time. Like I mentioned, we just have to get those payments in before 4:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time. On the Nickel Plus plan, So this is our most popular plan. The monthly cost is either $45 monthly or if you do an annual plan, we give a 20% discount at so it's $35 a month, but billed one time at $420. We give all customers a two week free trial of this if they'd like to just test out Nickel Plus. What this will do is it is same day to two day turnaround times for ACH processing. We remove the limit of three active users so you can have unlimited users. And we also bump the transaction limit up to $1,000,000 per ACH. You can schedule payments in advance and you can do recurring payments in advance. The plans are all within your ability to upgrade as you see fit. So you would simply just come into Nickel, go to account settings and click plans and you could upgrade at any point. If you do the two week free trial and you decide that Nickel Plus is more than you need, you can always revert back to the Nickel Core plan. But I'm just curious, you know, it sounds like based off what I've heard from you today, that Nickel could be beneficial. Would you be interested in testing Nickel out and seeing what it could do for the accounts payable side or even just receiving payments from your customers?
Hassan Niazi: I have to share this with my finance department.
Colton O'Farrell: Of course.
Hassan Niazi: See their opinion on it.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, well, I'm happy to link. So I'll link our customer reviews. So on G2, we have a five point rating. We're actually ranked the easiest payment solution to use, but I would definitely recommend coming and looking at customer reviews from a security and data standpoint. We're SOC 2 compliant, so we're always protecting you and your customers information. We're always moving money through FDIC insured accounts. So it's never our money that we're, it's always your money always. We're simply just moving it in secured accounts. We handle all the PCI compliance. So if there's any fees with credit cards, you will only ever get the net amount. And then we're protecting all of your customers' information with encryption and tokenization. And again, we have our own kind of main account. So Nickel is on the front lines when it comes to fraud, money laundering. We are the ones combating that. So we protect our customers from that with the way that our business is set up. What I'll do is I'll send you a link that has these resources that I've shared. I also have like a six minute demo video that I'm happy to share with you and for the team to review. But my recommendation would be to go ahead and just try using Nickel out for some of your like test customers. Some people like to just do the QuickBooks Online, mass connect everything and go ahead and get rolling. You're able to do that as well. But if you're still kind of trying to fill it out and see what your customers would think or vendors would think, recommending kind of doing that like slow roll and trying it out with a couple customers. But does that sound like a good plan for sharing the resources and just understanding what the team thinks about that?
Hassan Niazi: Yes, please. If you could send it to my email and I'll share it with them.
Colton O'Farrell: Awesome. Yeah. So I did have a couple questions before we hop off here. I was just curious from Like perspective, this doesn't change any kind of pricing, but I was curious, you know, you're operating in a lot of states, got a lot of customers. What are you guys doing in terms of annual revenue currently?
Hassan Niazi: Annual, we're looking about 5 million.
Colton O'Farrell: 5 million. And then for the accounts payable side, you're primarily paying via Zelle and via the ACH kind of bank wire side of things?
Hassan Niazi: Not really. The only time that we have to pay Zelle is if we have an instant or I could say a new driver, they are not familiar with our company. They don't trust us. We use Zelle. We do have vendors like drivers or transporting companies that they get paid monthly. They invoice us and we pay them by wire or we send them a check, e-check via Deluxe.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, you did. And this could potentially assist you with that process as well. I'm happy to talk to the other folks on the team if you think that would be helpful. A lot of times the demo video I send can answer a lot of questions. But Hassan, does it Make sense to just throw on a quick, like 15 minute chat next week just to see what the team's feedback is on that and see if we can get it rolling? Cool. What time and day in time works best for you? Did you want to do a week from now at the same time or we could do earlier?
Hassan Niazi: My gauge wall is pretty flexible.
Colton O'Farrell: How's Tuesday the fifth look for you?
Hassan Niazi: You know, I don't want to promise you then I don't show up.
Colton O'Farrell: You need to adjust.
Hassan Niazi: Just send me the link, please. Let me see the schedule.
Colton O'Farrell: And we.
Hassan Niazi: Take it from there.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, that sounds good. Just so, you know, on my end, I am taking a lot of calls every day, so I'm going to just send a placeholder for a week from today. So I'll send that meeting recap with the resources available, and just so I can actually block off time on our calendar in case we need to have that conversation, I'll do that. If we need to delete it or reschedule, happy to do that as well. But does that sound like a plan, Hassan?
Hassan Niazi: Sounds good. Also, for the drivers, if you can share this with your team, if you guys can find a solution to pay these drivers, that's the.
Colton O'Farrell: The.
Hassan Niazi: Problem we're facing, not me, I'm a small company, but I know plenty of companies that they have deliveries on daily basis, thousands of cars that they need to pay to the drivers on the spot.
Colton O'Farrell: On the spot. So I mentioned we are rolling a mobile app out at the end of this year, and that I think is going to be kind of the core functionality on that side of things. It was more so designed for individuals who are going to a job site and they need to get paid by the customer. But what we're trying to roll out is, I think would exactly solve kind of this issue with trying to pay drivers on the spot. So I'll definitely get some more information from our engineering team and just let you know kind of where we're thinking and where the product is going from that standpoint.
Hassan Niazi: Oh yeah, that will solve my problem and the rest of yours.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, awesome. Yeah, no, let me talk with the engineering team. I think we have some really exciting ideas for you. So I'm gonna go ahead, send that recap email once I speak with them. I'll send that placeholder just for the meeting for next week, and we'll take it from that. Sounds good.
Hassan Niazi: Awesome.
Colton O'Farrell: We'll appreciate your time, Hassan. It was a pleasure.
Hassan Niazi: Thank you.
Colton O'Farrell: You have a good day.
Hassan Niazi: Yeah, we'll be in touch.
Colton O'Farrell: Okay. We'll be in touch. Thank you. Yep. Bye-bye. Bye.
