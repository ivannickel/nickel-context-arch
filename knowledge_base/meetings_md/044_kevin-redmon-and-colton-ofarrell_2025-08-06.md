Colton O'Farrell: . . . . . . . . . . . Good morning, Kevin. Glad I could get you on. Sorry, Google Meet challenges there. But I'm really excited to talk to you today. Just wanted to learn a little bit more about your business and kind of reasoning for setting up this meeting today. Check out your website. I was curious a little bit of how you found Nickel, what you have going on today, and then any specific questions you have. Once I have that information, happy to walk you through the nickel demo per your use cases, and then we'll discuss kind of which plan meets your needs and kind of next steps. But how does that sound, Kevin?
Kevin Redmon: Sounds good.
Colton O'Farrell: Awesome.
Kevin Redmon: My website, actually, I'm going to be re- we're going to be revamping the whole thing in the process. But we do basically have a large payroll side of the company. Of course, we're an accounting firm. and so we do a lot of bookkeeping. This another, we do a lot in which we pay, we do everything for the clients or their back office. So we do the whole nine yards for a lot. I'm starting to do a lot of CFO type work that we're doing out across the country. So I'm trying to really combine and do some things. We have some, you know, I have, I have Credit card ACH, I have all these different things that we're doing. And I'm trying to run across Nickel and doing some of my research because I'm trying to change my deck deck type stuff and all the different programs that I'm using and try to combine and simplify and live easier and work.
Colton O'Farrell: What do you have in place today for your tech stack? and what you're doing for payment processing?
Kevin Redmon: For payment processing, we have EPS. We also use CPA charge for because it runs within a tax stone program.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep.
Kevin Redmon: Just because they have to open up, they have to pay before they can open up their documents. And EPS pretty much I think does the ACH and does some other, we also do, with payroll. We, you know, we have a payroll. I'm looking to change software, so I don't, I didn't know whether if nickel worked through software as well as far as that type of, that type of scenario, because I think we're going to change somewhere in the next few months on the software to make more. Depends on if I can find people. That's, that's the next.
Colton O'Farrell: Right, so when it comes to the processing today, so I imagine you're probably doing a lot of one-time engagements with some customers, but also doing some recurring where you have clients you're working with on a monthly basis. Yes. Do those amount. Go ahead, sorry.
Kevin Redmon: We have about a payroll that we do on a month that we do on a regular basis. We'll have between 80 and 100, depends on as they come and go and seasonals for some and so on and so forth. And then we have about, 50 or so bookkeeping clients that we do, and then we have several that we do everything.
Colton O'Farrell: Got it. And for those one time, or sorry, for the recurring kind of engagements that you have, at least for your client perspective, are those pretty static amounts in terms of what you're invoicing, or are they more dynamic and changing pretty regularly?
Kevin Redmon: It's probably, the bookkeeping's probably pretty steady. There will be some adjustments based on if there's other activity that goes on during the month. There are also the payroll ones, they, it's about half and half. Some are kind of a set because I have a minimum, and then some fluctuate based on the number of employees or checks that they do. And then we have, of course, we also charge the one-time thing with, because we have several thousand other clients that we do maybe a one-time or two-time thing.
Colton O'Farrell: Got it. No, that's really helpful information. And then when you're sending out these invoices to your clients, are you sending those out? Is that going through like a QuickBooks Online, CPA charge? What exactly are you sending that out to your clients as?
Kevin Redmon: It's a combination. And where I'm trying to get to one little bit. So we're doing a little bit of everything just because I don't do invoicing through QuickBooks. I'm not really a fan there, but we do what we have to do. But I do have, you know, we, whether we do it through a tax Dome program that we, I don't know if you're familiar with it.
Colton O'Farrell: I've heard, I speak to a lot of CPA firms, so it's definitely one that I've heard of before. Same with CPA charge. So some familiarity there. Yeah. So.
Kevin Redmon: Basically the, I lost my train of thought. So I do that.
Colton O'Farrell: No worries. Whenever it comes back, thinking about four.
Kevin Redmon: Things at the same time.
Colton O'Farrell: So, yeah, no, I totally understand. No worries there. I was curious, so when you send out the invoices, so it sounds like you're allowing customers to pay either like via ACH, via their bank, or like credit cards. Are you also accepting checks?
Kevin Redmon: Yes, we'll set checks in house usually. I like to pay from that, but I do, you know, that's where I would like to make it simpler to just do the ACH where they give it, they, they want to do it out of a check, then we just enter it, boom, gone.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep. And for ACH processing today, are you being charged for that anyway or your customers? Like, are you being charged to receive ACH to process it or your customers? You kind of have an idea of where that, what that looks like?
Kevin Redmon: Yeah, we, we get charged for each ACH that we, Receive.
Colton O'Farrell: Is it like a 1% fee or is it capped or anything? Just curious what you have set up today for that.
Kevin Redmon: Well, it depends on which one we do it through. And basically there is a flat fee that EPS charges and there's a percentage that CPA charge charges.
Colton O'Farrell: And are either of those capped at any rate?
Kevin Redmon: Yeah, and I don't remember what the CPA charge is capped at. The other one is just a flat, so much per ACH, doesn't matter how much it is.
Colton O'Farrell: Got it.
Kevin Redmon: That's less than $2.
Colton O'Farrell: Nice. And then for the credit card processing, so how does that work in terms of the kind of like the surcharge management? Are you adding that as a line item to process credit cards? Are you kind of trying to push away from credit cards? What's that look like today?
Kevin Redmon: No, we actually do an add-on. basically, we basically say this is what if you want a card, it's 3%, which that's one thing I noticed that you just add, that you would do the 3% automatic, whatever, which we just do that. And if they want to write a check or cash, then they're not charged the fee and then they're charged the 3% or whatever. So our rates fluctuate. with EPS, the way that, and I'm not sure if you're familiar with them, but it's more of an accounting type system, too, where it's primarily, I guess, tax because it's probably where they aim primarily because they charge a monthly fee, but only for the first five months of the year. Their rates range from 1.79% to 3% a little over 3 or something.
Colton O'Farrell: Got it.
Kevin Redmon: How that flows.
Colton O'Farrell: Cool. No, that's all really helpful information for me. So you mentioned before that you have like about 50 clients that you're doing kind of the whole round of bookkeeping for, working with a lot of CFOs. Curious, so this doesn't change anything in terms of like cost with Nickel. So we have a completely free plan, that's our Nickel Core plan, and then we have our Nickel Plus plan. I'm happy to kind of show you what those look like. But I was curious with the amount of business you're doing and revenue processing, what are you guys looking at in terms of annual revenue right now?
Kevin Redmon: We're right now, which we've increased each year, we're probably somewhere around 850 to 900.
Colton O'Farrell: Nice, okay, really cool, wow, awesome. Well, I don't think I have any specific questions for you at the moment. Is there anything you have for me prior to me kind of popping into the demo walking through some of your use cases and just making it interactive?
Kevin Redmon: No, like I said, a lot of what I'd like to do is kind of get into one little system to where we can do everything. Like I said, a lot of the, we did, we have several thousand tax clients that we do. So I would like to get where they can just go in and either pay it or if they're in house, then, you know, we just key it in and they feel like their check has been, Received.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, absolutely. Well, I'm going to go ahead and show my screen here. I think there's a couple different options of what kind of maybe will work best for you guys. So I'll just kind of explain, show you those. Can let me know your thoughts on those, but we'll go from there.
Kevin Redmon: Sounds great.
Colton O'Farrell: Gonna go ahead and share my screen now if you want to just let me know if you can see it. Okay. Happy to zoom in too if needed.
Kevin Redmon: Yeah, I may need to zoom in. You know what?
Colton O'Farrell: No worries. Awesome. Well, this is really when you would sign up for Nickel. This is the transactions tab, kind of the main tab that you'd be brought into. What you maybe want to do initially when you set up with Nickel is if you come to account settings here, if you go to integrations, we do have a native integration with QuickBooks online. So if you have your customers in there, if you have like invoices or, you know, any, even your accounts payable kind of bill pay in there. We can bring all of that over into Nickel directly. So we break it up into the accounts receivable here on the get paid tab and the accounts payable here on the bill pay section. We do have some automation. So my demo account here is not connected to a QuickBooks account, but I can show you what it would look like if you were. So a lot of our customers, we do have the capability to generate invoices directly with the nickel. A lot of our customers will just generate the invoice in QuickBooks Online and instead of reviewing it and sending it, they will simply hit save because we have some automation that you can turn on. So I have a screenshot of what that would look like. So if you're connected with your QuickBooks Online account, it would list, you know, your company name, Redmon and Redmon, and have your QuickBooks ID number here. And then we also have this automatic the one caveat payment where it's link that not can good be to sent have that automatically automation turned once on is an if invoice once you is create generated an within invoice QuickBooks in QuickBooks, Online. your customer is going to get that email right away. So if you come in there to make modifications or revisions, if you're frequently changing invoices, we recommend having that turned off, otherwise your customer would get an email for each one of those invoices that you're adjusting. But once that's connected, like I mentioned, we bring everything into the accounts receivable tab here. If you have that automation If turned it's on, not though, it's what you just would do automatically is simply just come over sent to the payment to your customer. requests tab here and click request payment. We would send this secure payment link right here, either via email or via SMS as a text message. I'm actually going to set you up as a customer just on my demo account here so I can send you the email so you can see what your customers will see. So I'm just going to go ahead and grab your information quick. All right, so perfect. So new customer and I'll go ahead and delete this once we're done. But I'm going to create you as a customer, going to add your email address. This is the one that will receive the invoice. And we also do have a payment authorization form that we could set up for any of your customers. So I imagine you have some agreements already in place today where you're just auto allowed to kind of pull from their account. Yes. Cool. Yeah, we can honor those previous engagements and agreements that you already have. The one caveat with there is our team does have to do federal regulations, know your customer, anti-money laundering kind of rules, and with generative AI and all the tools out there today, sometimes those previous and authorized forms, our team just has to do their due diligence to make sure that they're legitimate and meet the requirements.
Kevin Redmon: But if I'm sorry, I'm sure we'd have no problem getting them signed whatever.
Colton O'Farrell: Cool, awesome. So I'm going to go ahead and just quick click save here. So I've added you as a customer. Now I'm going to just generate an invoice directly from Nickel here that'll be sent right to you. Would you prefer to see kind of.
Kevin Redmon: A one-time engagement to recurring invoice?
Colton O'Farrell: What would be most helpful? I'm sorry, say that one more time. Would you prefer to see a one-time invoice quarterly, or like weekly, a recurring whatever makes invoice the most sense where we for could how do you're monthly, invoicing your customers.
Kevin Redmon: We do a combination of all, so any of it will be just fine.
Colton O'Farrell: Cool. So what I'm gonna do is I'll just send you the one time here for now, and it is E6. Cool. And then that typical kind of invoice amount saved for a one-time engagement, what are you generally looking at for the invoice amount.
Kevin Redmon: Invoice dollar amount for one, it can be anywhere from 250 to $5,000.
Colton O'Farrell: We'll just say that this one is a $500 invoice one time. If we are connected with QuickBooks online, we will automatically bring over any of your attachments and invoices. This is just one that I, a sample invoice that I grabbed just to show you that you can attach anything there. We will also rename the PDF, whatever is in this invoice number or purpose field there. You can add just a memo. So I'll just say, hi, Kevin, please. I'll just put demo here so you don't forget that it's just the demo. Awesome. So I'm creating that. We're going to send that to your email. You'll receive that in just a moment here. But I'm also going to copy the link and paste it into a new tab just to show you what it would look like in case you wanted to see what it looks like prior to sending your customer. So what your customer is going to receive, they'll receive this email that will have a pay now button. It's taking a moment to load here. Let's try. Yeah.
Kevin Redmon: Right now we're doing links.
Colton O'Farrell: Doing links right now. For.
Kevin Redmon: For some of them, yeah, if we send through email, we do it. It's a link.
Colton O'Farrell: It's.
Kevin Redmon: It's what instead of. I like to pay button.
Colton O'Farrell: All right. Attach the invoice real quick. I was just calling. For some reason, that is just being a little slow on me. I'm not sure why that is the case. I do have some sample invoices from previous demos that I've done, so I will just go ahead and pull up one of those to show you what that would look like. But your customer is going to receive an email that looks just like this. So it would say your company name, your logo right there, it would say payment request reminder. There'd be, you know, the amount, the memo, the invoice attached right there. If your customer hits reply, it's going to automatically CC you on any communication. And then once they hit the pay now button, we would be brought to this similar screen, which is, I'm not sure why this is, Being so slow today, I might have to let the engineering team know that this is being a little slow. Let's see, I'll just grab one. So this is what the customer, I'm not sure why this is being so slow here. Apologies for the technical difficulty here.
Kevin Redmon: Brother, I know all about it.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, this is the only, this is the first time it's happened to me in kind of a live demo, so I'm not entirely sure kind of what to expect. It's because of me, that's what it is.
Kevin Redmon: It's because I'm here.
Colton O'Farrell: No worries. Well, while that's kind of figuring it's kind of stuff out there, I'll just kind of walk you through some of the other aspects about Nickel that I think would be helpful for your business. So one aspect that I know you mentioned was the credit card. kind of surcharge, adding that as a 3% line item. So with Nickel automatically for accounts receivable, when your customer gets an invoice link, they're gonna have two options to pay. They can either pay via ACH completely for free, that's for you and for your customers. So there's no fee on ACH ever with Nickel. If they wanna pay via credit card, maybe for the 45-day float, or for credit card points, they're able to do that. There is a 2.99% credit If you come into card the settings surcharge field right fee. here, by default, 100% of that cost is to be paid for by your customer. This is a global rule that we're setting up here. You can change this at any rate, but like I mentioned, this is a global rate, so it would affect your customers. But yes, if you wanted to fully eat the charge, if you want to divide it 50/50 or just keep it at the default 100%, you have complete control over there. You can also actually override this global rule on an individual invoice level. Let's see if that still spin in. Some of these invoices that I had previously just created for you right now, if you go into settings here, we have some toggable features that we could turn on or off. For example, if we wanted to disable credit card payments altogether, we could do that. We want to allow the customer to edit payment amounts, we could do that. Or if we have this one on here, we can actually override the global setting so we could change. For all of your customers, it's 100%, they pay the charge. but maybe for this one client, we have an agreement, we're gonna split that 50/50, you can come in here and override the global setting, and then it's just gonna be sent to your customer via email or SMS, and what they would pay via clicking on that Pay Now secured link, and would just simply make the payment directly on that link. They don't need to have an account with Nickel, they don't need to sign up with us, but that's kind of what it would look like from just the invoice perspective. Something that might be helpful for you as well is we do give every customer a merchant payment link. So in addition to the individualized secure payment links that are being sent out that are tied to invoices, we do set you up with your own merchant payment portal too, which can be found right here. A lot of our customers will take this and embed it in their website. Sometimes it serves as a primary method. Sometimes it's just a backup method for customer to make a payment if that primary method's not working. But what this allows is So for I'll your customer just do just to come in, click make any that kind right of payment, there. But if they want to pay by card, they could do so. There's a 2.99% fee there. They want to pay via their bank and via ACH, it's completely free. But this essentially could just serve as a one-stop shop for customers to make a payment. This is all the payment portal background is completely customizable, so you can change all of that within settings just right here. So there's the branded logo for all of your invoices. The banner aspect here is for the payments portal. And for our Nickel Plus members, so members who have a paid subscription, we can actually create this domain or URL to be something unique or whatever you would like it to be. We're happy to change it to meet those needs there. What it looks like from a pricing standpoint, I can quickly just cover that. So like I mentioned before, we have two plans with Nickel. We have the Nickel Core Plan, which is the completely free plan that allows for 20, three active users on the account, $25,000 limit per ACH transaction. So it's not cumulative, meaning you can do a thousand of those, you just cannot do one at $26,000. We also give you access to the customer payment portal, completely customizable in the free plan, aside from the domain and URL, that's only a feature that's on the paid for subscription. But you get all the workflows that I just walked through within the Nickel Core Plan. On Nickel Plus, that's either $45 monthly or it's $35 a month on an annual subscription. So $420 annually. We give all customers a 14-day free trial to test out Nickel Plus. If it's more than what they're looking for, we can always revert them back to the free plan. But what this does is we bump up the limit from three active users to unlimited users. We bump up the transaction limit from $25,000 per transaction to just under $1,000,000 per transaction. You can schedule payments in advance, you can do recurring payments in advance. And then one other aspect as well is we actually speed up the ACH processing. So on the free plan, we're generally, we're still required to get all ACH submitted to our sponsor bank before the cutoff time, 4:00 PM Eastern Standard Time. But as long as it's done by you that time, can expect those ACH process into be into your account within two to three business days on the Nickel Plus plan. However, it's generally same day to two day turnaround time depending on when that is processed. But I'll pause there. Any questions when it comes to the pricing? There is no per transaction charge or any kind of hidden fees there. You'd only pay the subscription costs and anything more than that would be because you're either eating a credit card surcharge from your customers or you're paying like bills via Nickel and you're using a credit card to do so. But if you're just doing ACH completely through us, there would be no other charges associated. Okay.
Kevin Redmon: Now for each company I do things for as far as if we're doing then that would be a separate account for each one of those.
Colton O'Farrell: So what I have for my demo account here, this is just like a business account, but we do have a specific accounting firm that you could set up. So I do have Just like a sample of what that looks like here. So instead of you can notice kind of on the business account, it just has these tabs. But if you have an accounting firm, you would also have this tab here that says clients. You would just go to new client, you would add their information, and then you would have visibility into managing their accounting. Okay. But yeah, you could just go to any of their accounts and you'd be able to see kind of their transactions. Like I mentioned, this is just a quick demo account that we set up for the accounting view. But you do have, you would just add them essentially as a client here and you'd be able to manage the finances there. Okay.
Kevin Redmon: Now is, and you might be getting it later, is there a system, this is where I receive payment. What about companies where I'm making a payment? Yeah, on the bill pay side.
Colton O'Farrell: I'm sorry?
Kevin Redmon: On the accounts payable side.
Colton O'Farrell: On the accounts payable side, yes, I'm sorry. Yeah, yeah, no, you're totally good. So what you would do is it works the same way as the accounts receivable. So if they're living in like QuickBooks, you would see that we any of the invoices that are pulled in from QuickBooks, you would see that we have a QuickBooks logo there You'd as well. go You to would simply Make just Payment, come to any of the bills you would select that you whether have. you want to pay. So we'll give you the timeframe. So let's see, we'll grab maybe this one here, bigger payment. So your customer would just have to have their delivery method set up. So when you add them as a vendor, they would receive an email that requests just setting up their information. So if they want to receive that payment via ACH, they would simply connect the bank account. if they want to receive a check, we can also send them that as well. But most people are going to want to do the ACH processing. But we do give you a timeframe of when that will be paid. So if a credit card payment is made, you know, that's going to be a same day processing. If we're going to do the ACH here, so you can see the timeframe. So it's drawing today, August 6th, it's going to be one business day and we'll land in the account on August 7th. You would simply for this one, it's not going to allow me to do the review and pay because the customer has not completed the delivery method. Of course, this is just a demo account, but that is what the bill pay section would look like. And then you would get a PDF attachment of any kind of bills that you've made, and that would also be listed in the transaction tab as well for receivables, payables, and then there's refunds, returns, and chargebacks listed there as well. Okay.
Kevin Redmon: What is the charge for pay? Is there any charge for ACH going the other direction?
Colton O'Farrell: There's no charge for ACH at all.
Kevin Redmon: Justing, unless there's a, if they are charged, they would be maybe charged by their bank for some reason or another. Is this similar to a wired, I'm no ACH.
Colton O'Farrell: So it's a little, it's a little different. Your customers would not be charged either. So it is free for you and your customers for ACH. Okay. Okay. Cool. Yeah. Is there any other specific questions that you have, Kevin? This is kind of the majority of what I was hoping to show you today. We do one other kind of call out as well, is if you do have other businesses that sign up for Nickel, We do have this referral bonus as well. So you would have your own referral link here. And then there's, you know, some terms right there, but we will pay. So $250 for a new business that has been brought on to Nickel. If you get two of those, you know, that will pay for Nickel Plus for an entire year plus give you $80 in addition to that. But that was kind of one other thing just to call out that, you know, a lot of our customers seem to seemed to really like so wanted to share with you as well and we have it in that big box there so you're always reminded of it. But Nickel's been around since 2022. We have over 10,000 customers who use us for accounts receivable, accounts payable or both. I'm not sure if you're familiar with G2. Yes. You are? Yeah. So, yeah, so Nickel, I'm happy to share some of the resources as well but if you check out kind of the G2 Nickel review page, you can see We have a five-star rating. We're actually ranked as the number one easiest payment solution to use by G2. And I know they also have like a feature where you can actually compare. So like a Melio to Nickel or like a Nickel to bill.com or maybe I'm not sure if they have it for like CPA charge, but you'd be able to go and you know, you can read. There's plenty of other CPA firms that utilize Nickel. So I'll definitely link those for you if you're interested in reading some of those. I'll send you a follow-up email that has like a recorded demo as well that just kind of walks through most of the workflows we covered, but also showing you some of the aspects that because the technical difficulty there wasn't able to quite show you. But I'm happy to share those resources for you. If you have any questions that come up, be happy to answer those via email or if you want to give me a call. Another thing just to call out is Nickel, one thing Nickel is really known for is our level of support. So like I mentioned, you're always able to reach out to me, but we also have built-in support features here as well. So if you send our team a message, this will go directly to their team. They're generally answering those within 30 minutes to an hour, kind of at the latest timeframe. Generally, they'll usually, if it's a, you know, issue of some kind, they'll just pick up the phone and give you a call. So we have a lot of good reviews when it comes to just the human component and actually being able to talk 'cause to I a know person. that is increasingly more important as the world kind of changes. But before I let you go here, Kevin, was there any other questions that I could answer for you? Just curious kind of on your overall thoughts and what you think using something like Nickel could do for your business.
Kevin Redmon: I like the way it operates. What other software does it, do you integrate with any other software?
Colton O'Farrell: So right now, we don't provide like an open API to connect to other solutions. What our team would do is, If you're able to download like a CSV file from CPA charge or some of the other solutions you're using, they're happy to get all that information migrated into Nickel. We really only have the integration right now with QuickBooks Online. I know there's going to be, there's more development going on on that front and we will be connecting to more systems, but there wasn't a huge need for it because about 98% of our customers utilize QuickBooks Online. But we were happy to you know, download all of your information, whether it's invoices, bills, customers, vendors, and get all that inputted into a nickel just to make it as easy as possible for you. Cool. Okay. And really the only thing that you need to do, so you have all the information you need to sign up, to utilize nickel, how you see fit. The one thing you have to do essentially to be able to use the account is simply connect a bank account. But once that's been done and verified with Plaid, you can send or receive payments as you see fit. You can go into settings, you can upgrade your plan if you need to utilize the nickel plus plan. Otherwise, you can always just test out the nickel core and kind of see what your customers are thinking from maybe some test tries there. Okay.
Kevin Redmon: Sounds good, brother. All right. Is there anything else that special little Things that I might need to know.
Colton O'Farrell: Before I take it to my, the only things we are, we have a lot of development that we're doing. One thing that might be interesting from just kind of the tax perspective is I know we have a pretty massive tax product that will be rolling out and for, you know, managing kind of contractors, W-9 employees. I know they're going to have that roll out before like kind of tax season. So that's something just we'll be sure to update you on and kind of keep an eye out for it. We do you can obviously pay like contractors via Nickel with the accounts payable, but more of having it in kind of like a CPA preferred format. So that will be rolling out in the near future as well as we're developing kind of a mobile app as well. So what we've been doing for some of our customers with that payment portal is we actually are able to also put it into like a QR code. So you can take the payment link. You can go there's a website called QR.io. You could take that payment link, put it in a QR code. We've had some customers print it off. Some of them will just have it on their phone. So if they're like on site with somebody or just as a way basically that a customer doesn't have an excuse that they can't make a payment because there's so many options available. So we're happy to, if there's any ideas that you have in terms of product features or kind of just use cases, we'd be happy to discuss those and potentially look at building out some kind of solution for that as well. okay.
