Billy: Hello.
Colton O'Farrell: Hey, Billy.
Billy: Hey there. Today. Excuse me.
Colton O'Farrell: How's it going today?
Billy: All righty. All righty. Perfect.
Colton O'Farrell: Well, Billy, appreciate you hopping on the call today. I saw you sent that email over to me this morning. I sent it over to the support team. Sounded like you had corresponded with them a little bit, but just wanted to hear from you kind of on the call what's going on and see how I can best support you.
Billy: Well, I have a new business venture starting up. I need to be able to do ACH transfers basically get paid from my customers. And so I opened up a business account with my bank, which is Central Bank here in Missouri. And so that would make it easy for me to transfer funds from my business account to my personal account. So when I went to try to set it up in Nickel, it was giving me, when I found my bank, my business bank, it said it's not supported.
Colton O'Farrell: With just adding your bank account, or is it the Plaid verification side of it?
Billy: The Plaid verification side, Plaid said it's not supported that particular bank.
Colton O'Farrell: Got it. No worries if Plaid doesn't work. This comes up all the time for some of our customers. We do need to, because of some federal regulations, mostly from the Bank Secrecy Act. So we have federal know your customer and anti-money laundering regulations that we need to follow. Our team can manually verify your account for you. You just will need to provide them some information. So you can send it to support@nickel.com, or you can, you've already used the chat feature. But what they're typically gonna ask for is three months copy of bank statements, government issued ID, and- It was just.
Billy: Opened up last week. There's not three months.
Colton O'Farrell: Okay, right. So if you have this new account, so you would need to provide a government issued ID, Social Security number, bank routing and account numbers. Unfortunately, that information is not optional due to the regulations I mentioned.
Billy: Understood. So does it need to be sent via email? I really don't feel comfortable sending that over email.
Colton O'Farrell: What would be if you want to call, do you mean preferring on the.
Billy: Phone or on the phone, on a Zoom, whatever? Just not just like having that information sit on some email courses forever.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, I totally understand that. Let me see. We can absolutely do that. I'm just wondering what would be that. Let me ping our one of our regulatory and compliance engineers and just ping them for kind of the best way to provide that.
Billy: Okay. And, you know, I'd be interested in getting this done as soon as possible, like today.
Colton O'Farrell: Of course. Yep, of course. All right, I just pinged our engineer who will be advising in just a moment. So for this, so you set up just a separate bank account for your business. Is this the same bank that you have your personal banking through?
Billy: Yes.
Colton O'Farrell: Got it. So just a separate account just to kind of be able to transfer money between them.
Billy: It's not that simple. It's a business account. So if it was a personal account, it would be easy because I already have some records in played for for that. It's just this. It's what it comes up in as Central Bank Missouri and it says multiple locations or multiple options. So I click in there and then it. shows me Central Bank business and there's some indication there. I could just try it right now and tell you what it says. Yeah. So click to link. Something went wrong. I probably just need to refresh the page. Yeah, we log back in. Okay. All right. So it's under the get paid.
Colton O'Farrell: Set.
Billy: Up payments, and then yeah, maybe. Maybe I could share my screen. Maybe you can help. Yeah, because I was doing it before, but second. Tell me when you can see.
Colton O'Farrell: I can see it now.
Billy: Okay, so I thought I was under get paid. No, I don't, I'm not doing.
Colton O'Farrell: So you can go, if you click up, so if you click on any of those set up bill pay, set up payments, that's going to bring you to linking your, your payment method in order to essentially activate the account.
Billy: So where should I be on the left hand side here?
Colton O'Farrell: So you can go to go to get paid, click that and then click set up payments in the middle of the screen. And this is what would be to okay, scroll a little bit. Yep. So these are some of the kind of checklist items. So if you are on QuickBooks Online today, you can automatically sync that data over for the branded invoices that you'll generate to send to receive payments. You can upload your company logo right there. And it'll keep walking you through some.
Billy: Of the... Let me just ask you more questions. Everything I've seen about invoices, charges like 3% or something like that. Is there a way to do ACH without...
Colton O'Farrell: It's completely free with Nickel for you and for all of your customers 100% of the time, you will never pay ACH fees with us.
Billy: So I can create an invoice here, send it to them, and get paid and not pay any ACH fees.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, absolutely. So if you send that invoice to them, so typically what you do, are you operating on a QuickBooks Online or do you have a different system? So you would go to the get paid section. So once you complete the kind of account setup information and getting your account set up, you could go to the get paid section, create an invoice, Send that to your customer via text or via email. They would simply click a button if it was sent via email. I can show you what it would look like.
Billy: That's great. That's exactly what I'm looking for. At what point does Nickel become not free?
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, so I'm happy to walk through some of this. Here, I'm just going to open up a demo example. These are all some emails I've sent from previous demonstrations. Your customer would get an email that looks like this. So it'd show your logo, it'd have your name, so you have a new payment request.
Billy: Are you sharing your screen?
Colton O'Farrell: Oh, I'm sorry. Are you seeing the right screen? Maybe not.
Billy: I'm not.
Colton O'Farrell: Let me try again. How about now?
Billy: Yeah, I see now. Okay.
Colton O'Farrell: You see it now? Yep. Cool. Yes. So they would get an email that looks exactly like this. So you would generate that within Nickel. You would send it via email to your customer. I've attached the invoice right there. If your customer hits reply all, you'll automatically be CC'd on any communication. When they hit this pay now button, it's going to bring them to this screen here where they can either pay via ACH completely for free. They just need to enter the routing and account number, hit pay and complete that. If they want to pay via credit card, maybe for they want a 45 day flow to where they want credit card points, they can do that. There is a 2.99% fee that your customer It's will pay. 100%. The default setting is that 100% of that credit card fee will be paid for by your customer. You can change that at a global rule. So if you want to split it 50/50, if you want to eat the costs, or if you want to just leave it as is, you can do that. We would handle the PCI compliance. So you would only get the net amount of the $120 here. We would get the $2, or sorry, the $3.59. But again, we would handle the PCI compliance.
Billy: I don't see why they wouldn't want to just go the ACE pay by bank and nobody pays anything, right?
Colton O'Farrell: Sometimes they want it for credit card points or they want they get more they can stretch out of their cash flow. So it's just an option for them.
Billy: That's their problem.
Colton O'Farrell: Exactly. Exactly. Yep.
Billy: All right. So this looks great. So I know Nickel from what I can see it was free. But at what point?
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah. Let me walk through the pricing and the plans. So it can be completely free for you. It's mostly depending on your business, what you're looking to do with us. So we have two plans available. we have nickel core, which is the completely free plan, or we have nickel plus, which is our more advanced plan, generally designed for medium to large businesses. The nickel core plan, like I said, it's completely free. There are some limitations, some of those being you can only have three active users on the account. You can only do $25,000 per ACH transaction. It's not cumulative, meaning you could send 100 invoices for $25,000. you just cannot send one that is $26,000. So greater than that limit. We also give you access to this customer payment portal. So that can be found. Let me just get my account quick. So we also give you access to this customer payment portal that can be found right on the get paid screen right there. So what this can serve as is kind of a one stop shop or backup method for customers to make a payment. So this is included in the free plan. You can customize the name here, the branded logo, the background. To do that, you just go into settings and you change that all right there. What a lot of our customers do is they take this and they actually embed it in their website so that customers can make a payment for them. But here's what that would look like. So let's just say $1 test payment, they would be able to come. So say like in your website, you'd maybe list like payment portal. and they would come in there, they'd enter whatever they need to, if they want to pay you via their bank and ACH completely for free, they would just do so directly on your website right there. Or if they wanted to pay via credit card, they could do so as well.
Billy: I don't get to see or need to see any of their banking information.
Colton O'Farrell: No, so Nickel is designed so that only you see your banking information and only your customers see their information.
Billy: This is excellent. This is exactly what I need.
Colton O'Farrell: Perfect.
Billy: All right, so let's do what we can to set this up.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, yeah, absolutely. I just got a reply from our engineer. Getting a quick reply to our engineer. Alright, while I'm waiting just for his reply, I was going to just walk through quickly the workflow just so you can see that as well of how that would work. Since I know you don't have a system that you'll be operating off of, you can see this same payment screen. that we were on before?
Billy: I've lost your screen share.
Colton O'Farrell: All right, let me try it again.
Billy: Having a little bit of a- Stop sharing.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, maybe, yeah.
Billy: I just stopped sharing. Yeah.
Colton O'Farrell: Perfect. Yeah, so what I was going to show you is just going into the Nickel account. Oh, sorry for the- Let me see.
Billy: I can't see a screen share. Go away, wait, wait.
Colton O'Farrell: Let me try it one more time.
Billy: Okay, now I got you. Yep.
Colton O'Farrell: Awesome. So I was gonna kind of finish up kind of the earlier question you had on like when it doesn't become free. So basically I had mentioned you have the limitations on the free account, which are three active users, $25,000 limit per ACH transaction, not cumulative. You get access to that customer payment portal. You can send invoices via email or via text. Your customers can pay those. You're generally gonna get those in your account within three business days. so long as the payment has been made by the cutoff time of our sponsor bank, which is 4:00 PM Eastern Standard Time. If for whatever reason some of these limitations were inhibiting your business, so you can't schedule payments in advance, do reoccurring payments, or do payment authorization polls where you're just able to automatically pull from your customer's account on the free plan. However, you can do all that on the Nickel Plus plan. So this is either $45 monthly, Or it's $35 a month on an annual plan. So it's billed one time at $420. We give you a 20% discount there. What this plan does is we basically remove the limitations that are on the free plan. So there's no limit for the active users. You can do up to a million dollars per transaction. You can schedule payments in advance. You can do recurring payments in advance. We never are charging like hidden fees or transaction charges. We're speeding up the ACH processing time. So it's generally two-day turnaround time to get into your account. The only way that you would pay anything additional to this is if you are paying bills with Nickel on the accounts payable side and you're using a credit card. If you're paying bills via ACH, there's no fee for that. But basically, if you're paying bills with a credit card, there's a fee. It's at 2.9% or if you agree to eat some of It's that found credit within settings card on surcharge. the get paid tab. So you So can dictate like this I yourself. mentioned, by default, 100% of that 2.99% fee is to be paid for by your customer, but you have complete control here. So if you want to split that 50/50 with all your customers, you want to fully eat the costs, you can completely change this to whatever you'd like. So this is a global rule. You can actually override the global rule on an invoice level though as well. So if you have an invoice for one particular customer that you want to Split the cost 50/50 with them. You can go into the click onto the invoice, click on settings, and you can change that the fee right here. So it's going to override the global settings. So we'll have that be 50/50.
Billy: Gotcha.
Colton O'Farrell: But generating an invoice is very easy. You just go to, you're under the get paid set section here, go to new invoice, select your customer's name. Select myself, call the invoice what you need to. I'll call this 81825. For whatever amount, we'll do $1,000 one time. Mike Colton, please make the payment as soon as possible. If you need to attach any invoices, you can do so as well. And we'll also rename the invoice whatever is in this line right here. So I'm just going to drag that there, hit create. We're generating a secured payment link that's going to be sent to this email, or if you wanted to send it via SMS, you could do so. I'm going to send that out right now. I also copied this link here, so I'm going to open that up in a new tab just in case you were curious to see what it looked like before sending to your customer. But again, they're going to see that exact same thing that we had just shown. And if I go to the invoice.
Billy: You said I can set up the invoice to have my logo. Yep. Okay.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep. So this is that invoice I just generated. So it came through immediately. Same as kind of what we had shown you before. You can change all of that within settings. So you just go to account settings and you would change your logo right here and change your banner. It's going to have some size recommendations.
Billy: Is that the default one, what I'm looking at right now?
Colton O'Farrell: This is just for my demo perspective. So this is the default.
Billy: If I didn't have a logo uploaded, what would it show? Just nothing.
Colton O'Farrell: Yes, it wouldn't have a branded logo. It would have you walk through the setup requirements to set up your account before you'd most likely send that payment out anyways. Awesome. Another thing, it sounds like you already know about it, but the help center here, if you have any questions, you can send a message to our team. This will go to a live person that will answer. This will most likely usually be the best way to get in touch with support. I'm kind of more in the sales side and typically I'm doing back-to-back meetings, but I'm actually looking to transition to more of customer success and support, so I'm getting a little more involved there. But that is always going to be kind of the best place to go to to get immediate assistance. If you ever need somebody to help escalate things, I'm happy to do that for you as well. I did get, so are you able to get a letter of authenticity from your bank regarding this new business account that you set up?
Billy: I'm not even sure what that looks like. I can log in, you know, to the bank and check.
Colton O'Farrell: This might be something that you would personally have to request from them. I believe it's I don't think they would automatically just like have that sent up, but if this is somebody that you've already been doing your personal banking with, and you were just setting up that business account, you should be able to just call and ask for a letter of authenticity, letting them know that state, like when the account was created, its purpose, and then also any kind of history that they've had with you in terms of just your personal banking. But that will be really helpful for our team. I'm going to get more information via him and send this to you as a follow-up email, just so you have all the information you need. Also, link some of the resources of what I went through today, just in case you need to go back through any of it just for a refresher. But are there any other questions you have for me? I know we need to get this set up today, but any other questions you have for me about questions with Nickel, things that aren't unclear at the moment?
Billy: No, I mean, it looks like the perfect service, exactly what I'm looking for. I just like to get a set up.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, so I'll send a follow-up email. I'm gonna get the information I need from our engineering team. They will help me.
Billy: Okay, so are you still confident we can do this today?
Colton O'Farrell: I mean, that we can get this process? Yeah.
Billy: I mean, I'll call the bank and, you know, ask them over the phone if they could, you know, send it to me electronically and I can forward it to you.
Colton O'Farrell: We can get everything set up. today, as long as you are able to get everything our team needs in terms of a federal kind of regulations perspective, I'm going to clarify with him to make sure we get, and I'll send this to you via email, everything we need in order for you to create the account, get, well, not create the account, but get the payment method set up and send that invoice to your customer for payment. But yes, we should be able to get it completed today so long as we get everything that we need. And I'll send that email to you right after we get off this call here.
Billy: All right, I'll get on it.
Colton O'Farrell: Awesome, Billy. Well, let me know if you have anything that comes up in the meantime. If they say something like, you know, the letter of authenticity, but we still need to do like a, you know, we still need government issued ID, social security number, those things, you can always message the chat feature and say, Hey, can I call you so I can provide this information? I don't feel sensitive. I don't feel good about typing it up or sending it over electronically. Can I, you know, tell you over the phone? and our team would be more than happy to do that for you.
Billy: All right. Well, we're gonna get them on the phone with my bank right now.
Colton O'Farrell: Perfect. Well, I'll get that email crafted for.
Billy: You and send that over in just a moment.
Colton O'Farrell: Thank you, sir. We'll be in touch. It's my pleasure, Billy. Yeah, we'll be in touch. Yep. Bye-bye.
