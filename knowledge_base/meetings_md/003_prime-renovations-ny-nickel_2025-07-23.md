Colton O'Farrell: . . Hey, Jeff.
Jeff Streich: How's it going?
Colton O'Farrell: Going really well. How about yourself?
Jeff Streich: Not bad, not bad.
Colton O'Farrell: Awesome, awesome. Well, really appreciate you making the time today. I see you got your AI notetaker on here. Same here as well. I have a couple. I don't even, I have no fucking idea. We were like that at 1.2. We finally landed on this one called Circleback. Seems to be pretty nice, but very familiar with Otter.ai. Great tool as well.
Jeff Streich: There's too many tools.
Colton O'Farrell: I completely agree. It's hard to keep track of them all. Awesome. Well, Jeff, I really appreciate you taking the time to hop on this call with us today. So obviously you had received an email from my colleague Zach. Sounded like there was some interest there. Of course, we're going to be Sending you $50 via Nickel by like minute 10 here, just to show you how simple and easy it is to send or receive payments via Nickel. But would love to learn more about Prime Renovations, New York. I was going through looking at your website. Looks like you guys are on Procore today for your construction management software. Was looking into a little bit of your process, but was curious just to learn a little bit more about what's not found on your website and kind of what areas that you're dealing with.
Jeff Streich: And maybe some headache areas. I mean, we'd have to talk for four hours if we went over areas. I've been in business a long time. I've been growing slowly, and now I decided I'm getting too old to grow slowly. So now we want to just ramp up. This guy's called me four times today, so just excuse me one second.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, absolutely.
Jeff Streich: Nothing.
Colton O'Farrell: But, of course. Hello.
Jeff Streich: Who is it? I don't know what that is. I think you're funding from. I think this is like the third time you called me today, right? Something like that. Yeah, I have no interest. Thanks anyway.
Colton O'Farrell: Sorry. I'm sure you get a lot of those calls.
Jeff Streich: You have no idea.
Colton O'Farrell: Right?
Jeff Streich: So I'm looking at scale and I'm always looking. I'm old, right? So I don't know what we say I shit really, you know, I do, but I don't I know chat GBT to some degree, right? But everything seems to be getting easier, you know, like I'll be perfectly transparent with you. I just started using relay financial. You ever hear them?
Colton O'Farrell: Relay financial it's not one that I've heard of recently. How are you using them today? Love them banking banking.
Jeff Streich: Yeah, I'm not sure what you guys do, but like the payments using them is so easy.
Colton O'Farrell: Nice. How are you working with them today? Are you like using them for wire transfers? Are using them to like send invoices? What's kind of the setup you have?
Jeff Streich: Not invoices, but I know I can, but I don't. We use Procore to send invoices.
Colton O'Farrell: Okay.
Jeff Streich: What I liked about them And again, I don't know that much about Nickel, but what I like about them, whenever I start a new job, I could open up a new account. On my dashboard, I can have 20 different accounts, right? So let's say I get a job, 100 Park Avenue. All I have to do, create account, 100 Park Avenue. I have an ABA and routing number, I have a same difference, routing number and account number. My client said, why is money directly in? My favorite thing about them, I've same day ACH.
Colton O'Farrell: Okay.
Jeff Streich: I do that kind of month.
Colton O'Farrell: Do they charge you for ACH transfers? Nope. Nice.
Jeff Streich: And again, same day, same day's free, but I only get 10, then it goes, then it's one to one to two days. My wire transfers, five bucks.
Colton O'Farrell: Nice.
Jeff Streich: I literally just, no, I can't say I literally, I'm in the process of closing my TD bank that I've had for 20 years.
Colton O'Farrell: Wow.
Jeff Streich: So they really why it's 15 bucks. Every outgoing why is 15. For me to do ACH through them is a nightmare, you know? Can you.
Colton O'Farrell: Can you remind me, what is the name of that company?
Jeff Streich: That's relay Financial. Love them.
Colton O'Farrell: Financial. Yeah.
Jeff Streich: The bank. That's the software. And the bank is something called thread. They're pretty new. They're pretty new, but so, so easy. Now, I just spent 90 a month with them to get the top tier thing because I thought I was getting other benefits, which I'm really not getting, but I don't even care. It's just so freaking easy. It's so easy.
Colton O'Farrell: Well, that's the, you know, that's the goal. And if that's working really well for you, we love to hear that. Are there any challenges in terms of that invoice process when you're sending those invoices to customers via Procore? Can you kind of walk me through when they receive that? How are they paying you? What does that look like?
Jeff Streich: So most of the time it's pretty easy. It is confusing the invoices because generally speaking we use an invoice that is several pages because that's what the architects like and it makes us look good, but it's freaking confusing. It's stupid, you know? So sometimes we'll just send an invoice to a client and get paid pretty easily. Depending on the architect that we're working with, sometimes we got to send it, then we got to revise it, then we have to get it notarized, then we send it to the client, wait another two weeks.
Colton O'Farrell: Weeks.
Jeff Streich: But Procore, using Procore, you know, you just click a couple buttons and it makes this professionally looking invoice, which is nice.
Colton O'Farrell: Right. Yeah. Very cool.
Jeff Streich: Got it.
Colton O'Farrell: So you're, you're creating that in Procore, you're sending it out, but sometimes there's a delay with the customers paying that because of just how, you know, like dense, some maybe the invoice is just based on the architecture.
Jeff Streich: You want me to share my screen.
Colton O'Farrell: And show you one? Yeah, if you could, that'd be awesome, actually. Yeah, I would love to see what you guys are using.
Jeff Streich: Love Procore, little expensive by the way, the whole freaking system. And every time you want to add something, you got to pay more, but whatever.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, I know we have a lot of customers operating on Procore and they seem to really like it, especially on the general contractor side. of things.
Jeff Streich: It's. I mean, it makes you look good, quite frankly, you know, it really does. I wish I didn't have to pay so much. Like, I used to use build a trend. I don't know if you've heard of them.
Colton O'Farrell: I did in a previous, like, life at a different company, but I've heard of them since I've been at nickel.
Jeff Streich: So let's just go, for example, we'll go to this one. you know, when you tell an architect to use this, as long as they know pro core, they know you're like real. You know what I mean? Like this small guy isn't going to pay for this.
Colton O'Farrell: Right, exactly. No.
Jeff Streich: I'll tell you what, we do have problems with the invoicing from our subs. It's not so easy.
Colton O'Farrell: But like, invoicing for what?
Jeff Streich: Like when our subs invoice us.
Colton O'Farrell: You know, that's the accounts payable side of things.
Jeff Streich: Yeah, yeah.
Colton O'Farrell: Got it.
Jeff Streich: All right, let's just fix what this is a PDF. So you know what I'm talking about. Okay, so this is what they get, right? I mean, this page is easy, but if you really want to go into it, like current payment due 239, as you balance to finish. Blue dollar is, you know.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, pretty. Sometimes you scroll up just to that middle page. Most curious kind of a middle. Yep.
Jeff Streich: So that'll be all our trades, you know, allow our, you know, and then typically like a contractor, we'll just go 30. See, this was the deposit.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep.
Jeff Streich: Everything was just 30%.
Colton O'Farrell: So you send this as to the client to pay and then are you waiting for the client to pay you before you pay the subcontractors? Is that, is that kind of the goal?
Jeff Streich: I try to. I try to. yeah, that doesn't work always, but I tried.
Colton O'Farrell: What, what challenges do you have on that accounts payable side when it comes to paying your subcontractors? Any issues? Cash flow. Cash flow sucks sometimes.
Jeff Streich: Cash flow?
Colton O'Farrell: Of course. Yep.
Jeff Streich: Miserable.
Colton O'Farrell: And I imagine you're mostly paying them ACH and wire transfers. Are you doing anything else?
Jeff Streich: Only.
Colton O'Farrell: Only.
Jeff Streich: That makes no checks.
Colton O'Farrell: Do you, on the accounts receivable side, I mean, these are obviously large renovations you're doing. Do you ever have people that are paying via credit card or want to, or is it. Always ACH and wire transfers.
Jeff Streich: You know, strange, I probably have only heard like three people even ask if I take credit cards. Now that it's easier, if somebody asked, I'd probably say yes, but we got to charge you the whatever.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep.
Jeff Streich: But generally speak, you know, the clients are pretty freaking wealthy, you know, you.
Colton O'Farrell: Think they want the points at least, but yeah, exactly.
Jeff Streich: Right. Most of the time we just get money wired. I don't know how they have the cash just sitting around and all, but they do. Right. You know? Well, this is really helpful.
Colton O'Farrell: So, Jeff, thank you for showing me this. What I'm going to do now, we're kind of hitting that minute 10 mark. So I just want to make sure I show you what that accounts payable side looks like.
Jeff Streich: What I'm going to do.
Colton O'Farrell: I'm not in a rush. I enjoy learning as well. You know what I mean? Cool. If you're good on time and everything.
Jeff Streich: I am as well. Okay, cool. Awesome.
Colton O'Farrell: All right. Let me stop sharing. Cool. Well, what I'm going to do on my end, so I'm going to share my screen here in just a moment. What I'm going to do is I'm going to, you're going to receive an email from us at Nickel. So I'm going to show you the accounts payable side first, because I think that might be most interesting to you. So on the accounts payable side, I'm about to set you up as a vendor. So we're going to go ahead and go to Bill Pay right here, go to vendors, I'm going to go to a new vendor. And because I don't have all of your information, I'm going to ask you to fill that out if that's okay. So that's the email that you'll receive. so all I'm going to do is add your name and email in here, just like so. If you want to let me know once you get this, there we go. We're going to invite you, have you fill out your vendor information, and once that's complete, then I can send you that 50 payment.
Jeff Streich: So, I mean, your is your. I guess this is for any business, really, right? I mean.
Colton O'Farrell: We're purpose built for the construction material sector industry, but we have, like, we're, I mean, our total addressable market and all of the clients we have, we have over 10,000 companies using us for accounts receivable, accounts payable, or both. I mean, I speak with generally, like mostly general contractors, construction material industry companies, a lot of CPA firms, but sometimes I'm talking with lawyers, sometimes I'm talking with, like, IT people and tech companies. I mean, we have a pretty wide range of use cases that we cover it. We were actually a product-led growth company initially. So out of those 10,000 customers we had, like 95 of them self-served and signed up. And the primary reason why we have a lot of customers, if you look at any of our online reviews, especially on G2, that's kind of one of the gold standards for some online reviews. But we have like a 4.9 out of five rating primarily due to a lot of the benefits and services we provide completely for free to small businesses. So we allow them to do complete, unlimited ACH transactions. There's no charge there ever for any of our customers. And then we also give them a way for them to deal with the credit card surcharge. So a lot of states have different like compliance laws that credit card companies aren't able to, or when companies are issuing those credit cards, they can't really put that fee onto Their customer, even if the customer wants to pay that way. But how we do that, because we're not actually charging a credit card processing fee. We're charging like a nickel fee to process a credit card, slightly different verbiage there. But basically what it entails is that we're compliant in all 50 states and legal jurisdictions. So we give our customers complete control on how if they want to fully send that credit card surcharge to their customer, they want to split it or if they want to eat it. So Nice. Yeah.
Jeff Streich: So I'll give me, so this looks very similar to Relay. I'm going to show you, I'm going to share my screen.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, let me stop sharing quick. Yeah.
Jeff Streich: But what's interesting, I like the, I think I like the invoice thing where you still see how much you owe and that kind of stuff. You know what I mean? I'm assuming you sync to QuickBooks, right?
Colton O'Farrell: Absolutely. Yep. Are you also operating on QuickBooks Online?
Jeff Streich: Yes, so QuickBooks, QuickBooks, I hate QuickBooks, but most people do. I just hired a CFO. Right now I'm going to link my QuickBooks to my Procore, which just so the invoice goes from, it's so convoluted, I don't even know. The invoice that I put in Procore will go into QuickBooks, but I don't like using QuickBooks pay. I did for a little while, but they increased their pricing and the whole thing was, It took days and days for ACHs. I don't know.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep.
Jeff Streich: It seemed a little pain in the ass to me, really.
Colton O'Farrell: Absolutely. I mean, the nice thing I will say is that we do have a native integration with QuickBooks. So it's built out by our engineers. We have a lot of control, and it's like a real-time sync. So I think on average, it's like a one-second delay is all to get information from Nickel to QuickBooks or vice versa. So if we're using QuickBooks in this. Example, and we're getting the information from.
Jeff Streich: Nickel to QuickBooks, it would also get over to Procore as well, kind of using it as a bridge in that example. See all these accounts? So I could add an account, right? So like, just for an example, I just opened this one because I'm, no, not that one.
Colton O'Farrell: Sorry.
Jeff Streich: Did I just open this one because I just wired money in today, which didn't get there yet? But like, I mean, you go to the payees payments.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep.
Jeff Streich: You know, some missing payment information, but if I go pay elephant, which I have to, you know, as quick as make a payment, then see ACH, I have three remaining. As long as they do my three.
Colton O'Farrell: O'Clock, they'll get a 10 a month that they cap you at.
Jeff Streich: I have 10. I don't know why I don't have.
Colton O'Farrell: 10 free, and then you can do more, but they charge you.
Jeff Streich: Probably. I have no idea. You know, next day, no fee, five bucks for a wire. That's crazy to me. You know, checks I don't even bother with. And you pick whatever account you want to send it. That's it.
Colton O'Farrell: Nice.
Jeff Streich: See, I think they have like invoicing, but maybe they don't have it yet.
Colton O'Farrell: Interesting. Yeah, it looks like there's a lot, there's some similarities here with relay in with Nickel. I think we actually would beat them on the processing time and also on the free side of it. Just question, did you complete the vendor email that I sent you? No. Oh, if you want to just do that quickly, I will send that so you can see what that looks like.
Jeff Streich: Just bear with me.
Colton O'Farrell: No worries, take your time. All right.
Jeff Streich: I'll do a bit of checking. I gotta go back into relay. Hold on.
Colton O'Farrell: No worries.
Jeff Streich: Yeah, I look for. I need easy things. Like, I have to add somebody to my Google email today. I mean. Two days I'm working on it, you know? Right.
Colton O'Farrell: No, it's insane, especially with the AI stuff and all the integrations, LLMs. Yeah, it's all that's why I like we made Nickel to be very simple, straightforward, nothing that you don't need to see, only what's relevant to your business. And we frequently are complimented on just how easy it is to use. So I think you'll appreciate that aspect.
Jeff Streich: Almost done.
Colton O'Farrell: No worries.
Jeff Streich: Very slow these days. I play a lot of pickleball.
Colton O'Farrell: I'm exhausted, you know, you're doing pickleball, you said?
Jeff Streich: Oh, a lot of pickleball.
Colton O'Farrell: Nice. I I used to play a lot with some buddies in high school and then kind of fell off after I, you know, went to college and. recently, that's been nice. But I'm in Chicago, so some pretty nice running along the lake. But, yeah, I would love to get back into pickleball at some point. I don't know how you could have.
Jeff Streich: I don't know how you could have played and then stopped, to be honest.
Colton O'Farrell: I mean, we didn't have. The college I went to didn't have a very, like, I don't think they.
Jeff Streich: Had pickleball courts then.
Colton O'Farrell: They probably didn't. How long were you out of school for? So, I mean, I graduated, so I've been out of. School since 2019.
Jeff Streich: Yeah, no pickleball back then.
Colton O'Farrell: What's that?
Jeff Streich: What school?
Colton O'Farrell: University of Minnesota.
Jeff Streich: Nice and cold.
Colton O'Farrell: Very cold. Yep.
Jeff Streich: I've said some unlimited free ACH. Now, how long does your ACH take?
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, let me show you that quick. So I'm going to just cover the pricing element side that has all the information right here. so really, we have two plans with nickel. You can kind of ignore this far right one, but we have nickel core, and that's the completely free plan. We have nickel plus based on the restrictions with nickel core. It sounds like you would be most likely to use nickel plus because so this allow both plans allow for free unlimited ACH transactions. And there's, like I mentioned, no limit with them. However, on the free plan, we do cap the rate, the amount per ACH. So We do cap that at $25,000 per ACH transaction. It's not cumulative, meaning you could do 100 of those, you just cannot do one at $26,000. We also limit the free plan at three active users. You cannot schedule payments or do recurring payments on the free plan. However, all that's removed on Nickel Plus. So the Nickel Core is generally a two to three day turnaround time for ACH processing. We're still required to get it in by 4:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time with our sponsor bank cutoff times. But like I mentioned, the Nickel Plus plan would be most applicable to you. It sounds like based on kind of the volume that you're doing. But we either have monthly billing, so $45 monthly or $35 a month with a 20% discount on the annual plan. There are no other fees associated with, there's no like transaction costs or hidden fees here. The only way that you would be paying any additional costs on either of these plans are if you agree to eat the credit card surcharge on the accounts receivable
Jeff Streich: side. By no interest, no interest in either.
Colton O'Farrell: Exactly. And by default, it's set up 100% for your customer to pay for. So you wouldn't have to worry about that. But then again, if you were to do like accounts payable with us and pay bills via a credit card, that's the only way that you would see an additional rate there. But we actually speed up the ACH processing time. So it's generally same day to two day turnaround time. Still just got to get it in before 4:00 p.m. It could be same day though. Yes, absolutely. We just put the two-day on there. Like, it's generally same day, two-day, two two-day turnaround time. So we don't put same day on there just so people don't get upset if it's not always that same day, especially if they missed the cutoff. Very smart. Yeah. And then we bump up that. So we remove the limit on active users. You can have unlimited users. We bump up the transaction limit from $25,000 to $1,000,000 per ACH transaction. You can schedule which one? For the Nickel Plus?
Jeff Streich: For the Nickel Plus, you can do more than 25?
Colton O'Farrell: You can do a million dollars per ACH.
Jeff Streich: Do a million dollars ACH? I want to send that to myself one day. You know what I mean? Exactly.
Colton O'Farrell: That would be nice. So yeah, we got a lot of really cool features. You can schedule payments in advance. You can do recurring payments. We also have, so I'm just going to quickly show you the integration side of it with QuickBooks Online since you have that. Really simple. you just go to account settings, you go to integrations, you click this green link QuickBooks account button. That's going to bring you to QuickBooks page. You just sign in, select your company, chart of accounts, and then everything will flow into an accounts receivable perspective here, an accounts payable perspective here, and also on the integration side, if you do like a QuickBooks account, mine doesn't have one linked, but I do have a screenshot of what it would look like. So you just say prime renovations, New York City, it would have your QuickBooks number there. Underneath that, we also have this automation that you could toggle on if you'd like. I'm not sure if it would be recommended for you. What this would do is anytime an invoice is generated within QuickBooks, it sounds.
Jeff Streich: Like you're mostly doing it in Procore, but with- I don't even know yet.
Colton O'Farrell: I don't even know which one I'm- yeah, potentially it could be useful. But what this would do is anytime you generate an invoice in QuickBooks, it would just automatically send your customer via SMS or via email by Nickel. That way we remove that ACH processing fee or any of the, you know, fees that QuickBooks attaches on that. The only time it's, the caveat of when it's not good to do that is if you generated an invoice, but then you got to go back and like make revisions, modifications, add things, because your customer would get an email each time you do that. So if that's the case, we would recommend having that automation turned off. But what you would do, at least on the accounts receivable side, is you just come in here to get paid. All your invoices from QuickBooks Online would.
Jeff Streich: Flow directly into here. You just, although, you know, we'll never send an invoice through QuickBooks, that's for sure.
Colton O'Farrell: It'll always be from Procore. Right.
Jeff Streich: Yeah.
Colton O'Farrell: But we would be using Nickel, sorry, QuickBooks Online is kind of the bridge to get that in from Nickel QuickBooks.
Jeff Streich: To Procore based on kind of the workaround it sounded like. So using your, using Nickel, see, I envision using that for all my, all the trades, all my outgoing payments.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah. If you want to do, yeah, if you want to use us just for accounts payable, you can. You can use us for, I mean, with your subscription, you have access to anything you'd like within the platform. We have some customers who just do accounts payable. We have some who just do AR. We have some who do both. It's really just to equip you with the information that whatever makes the most sense for your business. But paying bills, same kind of workflow. I mean, all your bills will flow right into here. You just come to the far hand side where it says make a payment, and you'd go ahead and just select make a payment here. You select whether you want to use a credit card or if you want to use your bank with no fee. It gives you a timeframe of when that's going to be delivered. You just would hit review and pay. So, let's see, I'm going to go ahead and just double check here. Cool. So, let me just, and you received the $50 payment as well?
Jeff Streich: Who knows?
Colton O'Farrell: Let me just double check that. Oh, actually, let me try that. And if you have not. Second. Just gonna pop in here for a moment.
Jeff Streich: I mean, would it really hit my account already?
Colton O'Farrell: Let me just make sure I actually sent it because I couldn't remember if we got sidetracked when I was. I think I was showing you something else and I hadn't actually sent it yet. So let me just do that quickly. but there we go. The payment. I'm going to select that from our bank account here. So we have that time frame. So withdrawal today, it's gonna hit your account by tomorrow. Gonna hit review and pay. Just put a quick note here. Whoops.
Jeff Streich: So you guys really only Make money from the 35 bucks a month type of.
Colton O'Farrell: Right.
Jeff Streich: I mean, that's your.
Colton O'Farrell: And the credit card processing fees on accounts receivable. And I mean, we are already a. profitable company. So we've been around since 2022. Like I mentioned before, with that product-led growth, we had a ton of, like, we just cannot keep up with the amount of customers who are coming into us. And so we're trying to develop a lot of self-serve material and so that they can, you know, scale themselves and work with whatever plan makes the most sense for them. So I'm just gonna download that. I'll also send that to you via email, just so you have it. But here's that payment. PDF for you too.
Jeff Streich: Interesting.
Colton O'Farrell: But yeah, so just, I mean, your bills would flow right into here. You could just come in on the far right hand side, make a payment, you can do a new bill, just would add your vendor.
Jeff Streich: But the bills, like, I wouldn't do this, right? Because the bills would be in pro quo. I'm pro quo. So, I mean, basically, I'm just talking out loud now.
Colton O'Farrell: No, no, yeah, of course.
Jeff Streich: I have what's called a commitment to my car, right? For 100 grand, right? That goes in there, it goes to QuickBooks, and then I guess it goes from QuickBooks to Nickel, right? And then every time I make a payment through Nickel, let's say so let's say it says there's a balance of 100, 100,000, right? Pay 20,000. Obviously, that's doable, right?
Colton O'Farrell: Yep.
Jeff Streich: I paid the 20, and then after that, it goes back to QuickBooks to say it was paid.
Colton O'Farrell: Everything will be synced. Yes, everything will be real-time synced. All right. And I'm going to show you too. So, I mean, I'm not sure if you're going to use us for the accounts receivable side, but I'll just quickly show you that workflow in case you were interested. So again, all of your invoices would populate into here. You just come to this far right-hand side where it says request payment. You would either send that via email or via SMS to your customer. I'm going to generate just a quick invoice in here. You would never have to if you don't want to, but you do have that capability. So I'm just going to do this to quickly show you what it looks like from an email perspective. Can I add myself as a customer? Quickly before I do that, in the account settings, so obviously you're going to keep this as is, but this is where it's 100% global rule for your customer to pay that credit card fee, but you can adjust this at a global level to be whatever kind of percentage you would like. But then when you come into the.
Jeff Streich: Invoice side here- Literally, like can you charge 4% if you want?
Colton O'Farrell: Yep, if you want to charge 4%, you can. Yeah, we can do complete control.
Jeff Streich: I mean, I wouldn't be killing, but you know what I mean.
Colton O'Farrell: Exactly. So here's the just generating, let's do a new one. 2325. What are your general kind of invoice amounts or ranges? I know you're obviously doing 2000, let's say. How much is it?
Jeff Streich: 300,000.
Colton O'Farrell: 300,000.
Jeff Streich: Just for the sake of argument.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep.
Jeff Streich: It should be, sometimes it's not, but you know.
Colton O'Farrell: Awesome. And then all of your invoices, attachments, everything from Procore would flow directly into Nickel here. Because we're generating the invoice itself, I'm just going to attach one quickly. But when we go to advanced features here, so we can actually disable credit cards as an option, if you would like. You can also allow customers to edit the payment amounts if you like.
Jeff Streich: Never send that out to them ever.
Colton O'Farrell: You know what I mean? Yeah, exactly. They would love that, I'm sure. But this last option is where you would override that global setting. So even if we have that 100% for all of our customers to come in right here, this would override that global rule just for this individual invoice. So you also do have that kind of flexibility there. But I'm just going to go ahead and create here.
Jeff Streich: So I have a question.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, what's your question?
Jeff Streich: But what are they paying? You know what I mean? So you're getting that 2.99%, right? Your company. So if I reduce it, I'm paying half, they're paying half or whatever I want in between. And if I want to make it more, I get the difference in theory.
Colton O'Farrell: Oh, and sorry, just with the percentage. So the rate is always 2.99%, but you can determine how much of the 2.99% percentage-wise that you want to pay.
Jeff Streich: Yeah, I would keep that on. Okay, got it. Got it.
Colton O'Farrell: Cool. But yeah, this is gonna be sent via email. If we wanted to send it via SMS, we could. If you also were curious to look at what this looked like, I'll have to see what it looks like. Sending to your customer, you could also copy and paste this link in a new browser. I'll do that, but also gonna send that off. So here's what that just looks like copying and pasting into a new browser. So it's gonna show your name, it's gonna show your email, your logo, invoice name or number, the amount, and it's gonna give these two clear options to pay. Customer wants to pay via credit card, it marks at 2.99%. They want to pay via their bank and ACH, no fees there. They just need to enter their routing account number and simply hit pay and it'll be complete. What it looks like from the email perspective. So this is what your customer would receive. Very similar to what we just showed you, invoice is attached. They reply on that, you'll be CC'd on communication. And when they hit this pay now button, again, they're just going to be brought to the same screen again. But very slick, very nice. Do you ever do payment authorization polls from your customers where they have given you authorization to pull? Or is that anything that'd be relevant to you?
Jeff Streich: I don't even know what you're talking about.
Colton O'Farrell: So we have this feature set up within our Nickel Plus account. So when you're setting up a new customer, we would bring in all your customers, invoices, all that. But if you're setting up a new customer within Nickel, we can actually set this click this set up payment authorization request. So if I just selected, or if you click this set up payment authorization, so I'd have to add like a new customer here. But what your customer would receive would be an email that looks just like this. It would say that there's a payment authorization request from Prime Innovations, New York. If you wanted to add a memo or message, you could. We have some frequently asked questions with answers, but if that was too long and they didn't read it, We do have it on the second page here for them. This is letting them know that this is an authorization for Prime Renovations New York to pull from their account based on agreed upon criteria. So let's know that we're the payment processor, all their information is protected, we're SOC 2 compliant. They can revoke this authorization at any point and then it tells them that they can either pay via credit card or ACH. They would just go ahead and get started. If there was a transaction limit, it would be listed. If there was an expiration date, it would be listed. In this example, I have none. But they would simply just hit, click those to agree, hit next step, how they want to pay for that, review, authorize, and you'd be able to pull from their account as long as it meets that certain criteria. So maybe it would be helpful, not entirely sure.
Jeff Streich: Who knows, people in New York are.
Colton O'Farrell: A little, you know. Right. But the last thing I wanted to show you, not sure if it will be super helpful, but we do equip all of our customers with this payment portal. And I just wanted to point it out in case it was helpful. But all of our customers, in addition to sending these individualized invoices, getting paid by the customer, we also set up every customer with their own payment portal. So that's right here. Most of our customers will take this and embed it in their own website. It's completely customizable, so you can customize the background, the banner, the URL and domain. We can do whatever you'd like for that. But this kind of serves as either a backup place for customers to make a payment or like for some of our customers, it is a primary method. But they could come in here, just make any amount that they want, list the reason, go to make a payment, and then it's again, they could pay via card 2.99% or they could pay via ACH for free. So that's not bad. Yeah. I'm not sure if it'd be helpful for you, but it is something that you're able to access on day one if it is something that would be helpful.
Jeff Streich: Very nice. Very nice looking.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah. Do you have any so with the credit cards too, if that ever comes up, I just wanted to call out that we also handle all the PCI compliance. so you're only ever getting the net amount. We take care of all the fees. Like I mentioned, we're compliant in all 50 states and jurisdictions. We also protect everything with tokenization, encryption. We have built-in fraud protection, bank level security. All the money is always yours. We're simply the processor. So it's all being moved in FDIC insured accounts. And one really nice thing that a lot of customers like is that the way that Nickel is set up, We have like our sponsor bank, we have our own account. That is like a massive account where customers are pulling from. So there's no potential for fraud to impact our customers because we are essentially the blocker in between that. And that's another perk that a lot of customers really enjoy. But I'll stop there. What questions do we have?
Jeff Streich: I don't really have any. I'm going to run it. I'm going to run it by my CFO. I kind of like it. I like the I'm trying to think, why wouldn't I do it?
Colton O'Farrell: I mean, yeah, curious if there's any.
Jeff Streich: I'm not using the QuickBooks Pay because I hate them.
Colton O'Farrell: Right.
Jeff Streich: And I love, again, the ACH is from my bank is fine, but they still, I don't have them talking to each other, really.
Colton O'Farrell: Right.
Jeff Streich: I like, I think, is the, the more the invoicing, you know.
Colton O'Farrell: Absolutely.
Jeff Streich: Invoicing helps.
Colton O'Farrell: Well, you know, a lot of our customers, they will do like a test trial with some of their most like loyal customers to get a feel for it. Some of them are just sick and tired of everything that they have in place today and they love this and want to just rock and roll. We try to equip you with whatever makes the most sense to you. So what I'll do is I know you have that conversation with your CFO. I will send a recording video, like a pre-recorded video.
Jeff Streich: That's a good idea. I like it.
Colton O'Farrell: Workflows we covered, all this, our security page, our customer review page, anything else that would be helpful?
Jeff Streich: No, I can't see not to, I mean 35 bucks a month.
Colton O'Farrell: Right, yeah. And Jeff, I was curious, I saw, I didn't quite see how many customers you were working with and I saw kind of average invoice amount, but was curious, obviously it looks like you guys are a pretty large company. What are you guys doing in terms of like number of customers and- We.
Jeff Streich: Only so- We are boutique companies. So just for an example, like again, I've been doing this a long time. The wife has a good living. So I really wasn't trying to do anything.
Colton O'Farrell: Right?
Jeff Streich: Right. So we'll only do, we're probably now doing 10 to 15 projects a year. Most of those jobs now, and again, five years ago, we were doing a bathroom for like 25,000. Now we don't do that. So now we'll probably do each job seems to be averaging about 700,000.
Colton O'Farrell: You know, 700,000 and about 10 to 15 is probably revenue.
Jeff Streich: Yeah, but we're not doing 7 million yet, so that's a lie. So we're only doing like maybe 3 million a year.
Colton O'Farrell: 3 million a year ish.
Jeff Streich: Yeah, which is nothing. It's nothing. It's really not that. So I decided I got to get it to 10. So I just hired a whole sales thing, AI, blah, blah, blah. Hopefully that works.
Colton O'Farrell: That's exciting.
Jeff Streich: I am trying to scale to do at least at least 10 million.
Colton O'Farrell: Got it.
Jeff Streich: I can't do this forever. I just can't do it.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, and if you're looking to sell the business too in the near future, I mean, the growth is really important for that as well.
Jeff Streich: It's huge, right? I couldn't sell it now. It's worth nothing, you know? But I want to get to 10, because I want to play pitbull every day.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, exactly.
Jeff Streich: You gotta play with the quints. I get better and better. Like if I played you when you're a young guy, I'd probably kick your ass. You know what I mean?
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, you would. I I'm very rusty, so I'll be. I'll be honest with that. Jeff, I know we're about to get kicked off this Zoom call here. I know you have to talk with.
Jeff Streich: The CFO, and I'm happy to send me the recording. I don't. I think, you know, if you want.
Colton O'Farrell: To get back to me.
Jeff Streich: What's today?
Colton O'Farrell: Today is Wednesday. Do you want to set up a quick, like, 15-minute call check-in next Wednesday at this time?
Jeff Streich: Yeah, that'd be perfect. Cool. I will send that. I don't see.
Colton O'Farrell: I don't see not doing it. I don't see the point of not doing it. you know, yeah, we'd love to. And maybe by that time, too. So all you have to do is, you know, create your account, link a payment method. Once you do that, you're able to rock and roll, send payments, receive them.
Jeff Streich: You could trial it, test it out how you want. You could match. One of the big things I'm waiting for. And again, the CFO is new to my company. He's doing all the charted accounts for the QuickBooks thing. So until that, once that it's done.
Colton O'Farrell: Then I want, you know what I mean? Like, I don't even have it hooked up with Procore
Jeff Streich: yet, but. Yeah, yeah. Well, we'd be happy to help there as well too. Awesome. Next Wednesday, send me an invite.
Colton O'Farrell: Will do. And I'll send you that recap too with the demo video so you have that as well. Pleasure meeting you. Hope you have a great day and we'll talk soon. Thanks. Bye bye. Bye.
