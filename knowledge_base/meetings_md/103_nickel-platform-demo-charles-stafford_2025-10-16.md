Christian Sheerer: Charles.
Charles: Sorry, it looks like I had the sound off. How are you?
Christian Sheerer: Oh, you're good. How's it going? Good. Cool, cool. Doing well myself. I know you spoke with Zach. I typically we, I mean we saved like 30 minutes. Is that okay?
Charles: Oh yeah, yeah, that should be fine.
Christian Sheerer: Awesome. And typically start out by kind of, you know, asking a little bit more about how you guys currently run payments and why you thought this would be interesting to kind of learn more about with regards to nickel.
Charles: Well, you guys had reached out main reason. And two, we use, we use QuickBooks for all of our payment processing. Unless it flows through Zelle, you know, it'll go directly from Zelle to my, that customer's account to my account. But for the most part if we take any type of card it's running.
Christian Sheerer: Through QuickBooks and that's their. So walk me through that. You're creating an invoice in QuickBooks and then you send it out to them and then they'll sell you.
Charles: Some customers will sell me. Yes. Or for the most part, like I said, if it's a, if it's a card, we'll send them the invoice. It has a payment link on there. They click the payment link and they put their card information in there and we, we get the, the payment. What's nice about. And one of the reasons why I really haven't changed. QuickBooks gives us access to the, the funds like pretty, pretty quickly, like almost immediately. So but we pay a, you know, I think it's a one and a half percent charge on, on top of the transaction fee for that access. So I mean it's, you know, our average transaction is, I mean I probably could run it. It's you know, about four to five thousand dollars. So yeah, you know, the, that one and a half percent. Not you know. Yeah. The biggest problem that, you know, I would love to find a way to change is 9 times out of 10 what ends up with our business that we're mainly insurance based. So we're not insurance based, but a lot of our jobs come from insurance claims.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah.
Charles: So the insurance companies will either pay us directly and if that's the case, it's a check. We just deposit the check, you know, yada yada. But from time to time they will pay the homeowner directly. And so that's when we send the invoice and you know, we have to work on collections and, and then that's when the card comes into play and we, you know, get paid that way. What, what we don't like to have happen, because in many cases, what, what ultimately that is is they've gotten paid by the insurance company and they've deposited their check, so now they have cash on hand or cash in their account. And because we give them the ability to use a credit card, some customers have taken advantage of that and use their, like, you know, Amex and that, you know, we get hit with whatever that is. That's three and a half percent or whatever. It's ridiculous. So, so what I would love to be able to do, because, you know, QuickBooks doesn't offer that, but the ability to go ahead and, you know, include.
Christian Sheerer: A.
Charles: Processing fee in the event that it is like the likes of amex or what have you.
Christian Sheerer: So you guys don't pass it on?
Charles: No, because it's not, it's. It's very. I don't even know how to do it, to be honest with you. It's like QuickBooks. I don't even think it allows it or it doesn't have. The platform, doesn't have it.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. What are you guys doing? What are you guys doing every month? Number in terms of ACH and credit card. Monthly, Roughly.
Charles: I'm sorry, say that again.
Christian Sheerer: What are you guys doing, like, monthly in terms of ACH and credit card?
Charles: See here, I could probably. Give me just one second. Let me see if I can pull it up. Oh, my gosh.
Christian Sheerer: I mean, rough, Rough estimate is fine too.
Charles: I'm gonna just call it 50. 50,000.
Christian Sheerer: 50,000 across the business.
Charles: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, cool. And you think that's about 50, 50 credit card and, and people paying over Zel. Ach.
Charles: No, I, I would say. I mean, a good majority of that is the. I would say the vast majority of that is on the, on the card side.
Christian Sheerer: Okay.
Charles: So. So I'm just trying to find. Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: The specifics are not, not too serious. I was just kind of trying to break out in my head how I think we could save you quite a bit of money. So what we do is it's 2.99 and we pass it on to the customer by default. We have a way that you can actually pay the fee on the credit card if you want, but the default is to pass it on to the customer. And most companies obviously, like, opt to use that. The way that we can do that is because we are processing like we're as a service fee, processing the payment. So you don't have to add it as to one of your line items. Right. You can just have the link go out. It's a nickel link. Straight from a QuickBooks invoice that comes into nickel as soon as you link up your QuickBooks. You guys use QuickBooks online, I assume, right? Correct. Yep. Cool. And so you'd link up Nickel and QuickBooks Online, and then you're just sending out that link and they are able to pay in whatever way that they want, really. So they can pay with amex. They'll pay 2.99 on top, and they'll pay for that convenience of being able to use their credit card. The cash flow advantage that. That gives them what have you. Or if they don't want to pay that fee, they'll just pay the ACH straight up. And it'll, you know, be a lot easier for them because they don't have to hack like, you know, hound you down for Zelle stuff and, you know, you don't have to collect their account and routing number information, etc.
Charles: Yeah, I think. I think we tried this with another processor a while, probably three or four years ago, and it just didn't. It was. It didn't work. Let's just say that.
Christian Sheerer: What do you mean it didn't work?
Charles: This particular processor wasn't. They were newer and they were just having. They couldn't get their stuff straight. So I was just like, all right, enough of this. I'm done. So I'm just gonna stay with quickbook. So. Oh, let's see here. I'm just trying to find. Okay. It's not really a.
Christian Sheerer: What. What are you looking for?
Charles: I'm just trying to look for the payment details. Oh, here we go. Yeah, perfect. That's what I wanted. Okay, so. So last month, September, we did 29,000 in gross transactions and we had fees assessed of.
Christian Sheerer: Holy.
Charles: That's.
Christian Sheerer: See that?
Charles: I knew that I was getting freaking screwed. $1,399.48 fee percent aggregated fee percentage is roughly 4.74%.
Christian Sheerer: Wow.
Charles: We had two. Two Amex transactions that went through a totaled $10,325. So that's.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, that's why I brought that average up. Huh?
Charles: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. Well, I mean, our ACH is free. The credit card you can pass on to the customer. I'm very confident it will work. I don't know what other company you were dealing with that, you know, didn't. Obviously I'm going to sit here and tell you that the software is going to work, but I can explain why. The reason is because. So our founder came from Stanley Black and Decker. The other founder built out the payments for airbnb and they came over or knew each other and they figured out, okay, cool, there's this like swath of businesses who are in the built world who are sort of like industrial businesses who are not just software companies that need a payment solution too and be able to transfer a large amount of money without having to drive it in the truck to go to the bank and drop off a check. And so what we built our kind of payments infrastructure around which was like new and sort of first of its kind is the ability to move a large transaction of, you know, upwards of a million dollars per transaction with no fees on ACH and quickly and securely. So because of that we probably have like one of the highest, excuse me, security grades of softwares that move money. And also because of that, you know, we're able to do pretty well for people who do not as big transactions because you know, it's the same process. But we've invested the time to make sure that the security and the, and you know, the actual tech can move that much money directly linking up with the Federal Reserve, partner banks, et cetera. So the way like you guys would interact with it is like super simple. You'd come in, you'd, you'd log in and you just integrate your QuickBooks right away. So, so that once that happens, all the old open invoices in QuickBooks pull over and then you go and just, you hit, you know, request payment from somebody. So I'll do it from here, I'll just make a new one. But you know, usually you would just do this in QuickBooks, right? And it would come over here and you could just review it in nickel, just send it via the nickel link because they need to use that link. Another reason that's kind of a point of it too is it's a little bit more secure, is it's one link per payment and we settle each payment tied to that one link. We're not batching processing. You can do, you know, multiple invoices, send them at once. But on the back end when we're actually processing the payment, we're not, you know, batching all these invoices which has the risk of like commingling funds, causing errors because you know, you then have to reconcile it on the, on at the end of that when you're the payment software. So if I'm like saying the, the purpose, do you guys have usually recurring or just one time invoices for people? One time, right?
Charles: Most of the time it's just one time. We do have, you know, some of our repair jobs, you know, we take 50% up front and then the remaining balance at the end we're working on getting our servicing agreement in place so that we can do annual contracts. So that will be the one that you know, will change things a little bit, you know, from the standpoint of, you know, those invoices. Because you know, we may do, you know, two payments or, or spread it out over 12 months or something. You know what I mean? Yeah, but yeah, that, that's, I mean everything else is just pretty much a one time dare.
Christian Sheerer: Cool. So yeah, you can do both. You can have one timer recurring and then that here, that QuickBooks invoice that you created will just pop up here automatically and then you'll create this link and you'll send it out. And so what it'll look like on their end in terms of like making it simple for them to be able to pay out is you'll get, you could put your brand here, right. And they'll as. So now I'm the customer that I, I just made one as you and then now I'm, you know, Christian paying you out. I'll get 1, 800 water damage. Right. I'll get the logo, etc, have a new payment request. I'll go in and I'll just pay. And if I'm paying by card, I would get that fee assessed to me. Doesn't matter if I use Amex or anything else. And then if I want to pay by ACH and avoid the fee, I can just pay by ACH and put my ACH info in there.
Charles: Okay, that's, that's pretty transparent and nice that way. Okay. And then so, okay, so timing wise that, so that was the biggest issue that came into play because I mean unfortunately with the way our business is set up and, and, and the struggles that we have with regards to elections, you know, it's hard for us to wait. And that's why I like the instant settlement. Because it's like, hey, I mean, I got to pay bills and because you know, our payments are lumpy, it just, it's very, very helpful for us to get, get that payment in quickly.
Christian Sheerer: So how quickly do you get it.
Charles: If we do the instant transfer? Like it's, it's like five minutes.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah.
Charles: So like it's, it's literally like I hit, I'm, I'm out on the road, know, at a job site and I hit, you know, get it now. It says and lo and behold it's, it's in my account. You know, as soon As I click out of that window and pull up my, my bank of America account, it's pretty much there.
Christian Sheerer: That's through QuickBooks.
Charles: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: Okay. H. Okay. Well, I guess the decision is really, is that worth 1200 bucks a month or 1400 bucks a month?
Charles: Well, and that's. So I just, I just printed off this year's stuff so far. Check. I mean, like $9,500 so far this year of what we've paid, which to me, see, I mean, that just seems a lot.
Christian Sheerer: Like a lot. But I mean, it is.
Charles: I mean, that's, I mean, that's a.
Christian Sheerer: That's 10 grand just to move the.
Charles: Money, wages and stuff that I could be paying people, you know, that's the. So, okay, but then with you guys, how. What would be the time frame if we, you know.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, yeah. For ach, it's. I mean, you'll get notified that you'll. That it's been paid as soon as it has been paid, but it'll take two days, two business days usually to clear for credit card. It'll be one business day.
Charles: Okay. So when, like let's just say for instance, you know, we process a transaction today.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah.
Charles: Is that so? On the credit card side, it's. You said one business day. Is that tomorrow afternoon. It'll be in my account or it'll be in my account Monday.
Christian Sheerer: No, tomorrow.
Charles: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: And then if it was ach, it would be Monday.
Charles: Got it. Okay.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. I mean, that's the name of the game in like financial technology, right? Is making the payments as fast as possible. We're making steps towards getting there. But most companies who do what we do, if they do payroll, if they do moving money regardless, like two business, two business day. ACH is like the standard. Almost nobody does the ACH for free and nobody can like, work with the credit cards in the way that you can pass it on to the customer and, and you can really just eliminate that 9, 500 bucks a year or. Sorry. Yeah, 9, 500. And so because, yeah, that, I mean that the, the long term horizon is like same day is something that we want to do for sure.
Charles: I mean, if, if I'm, you know, understanding, you know, we would just put that in there, pass it in, pass it along to them. If they want to pay with the credit card, they, you know, they, they pay the fee and, you know, we get the full, the full balance of the, the transaction, which, I mean, yeah, I mean, because, I mean, yeah, we get nickel and dime left and right with everything else. So it's I mean this is, this is probably killing me, you know, I mean 10,000 bucks is a lot of, excuse my language.
Christian Sheerer: You're good, you're good. Yeah. That is a lot of money.
Charles: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: And so I mean the, the nice thing too here is like I've sold software before and I talked to people and I would tell them to get ready for like, you know, four weeks of implementation. You could really get an account started. You can run your first transaction today if you wanted to. So typically we would do in terms of like next steps when people are thinking that it'll be a good fit and that they might want to start rolling it out is, you know, I can give you a summary of like how you can, you know, get in well, a summary of our conversation then like kind of a walk through or I'll just link to the account where you can get your account set up. You set it up, put in banking information, etc so that, you know, we can actually send money to you and then link up your QuickBooks and then run a couple of transactions and then we can get back together after you run a couple of transactions and troubleshoot any kind of like, I don't expect there to be issues with the software, but maybe, you know, you need a refresher on some of the workflows and like where to click and what to do and what best practices are and then we can come back together and do that. And then after that you'll probably be like, well on your way to just say, you know, continue to use the software. It'll be, you know, second nature for you.
Charles: Got it. Okay, so the other quick question that I would have, but I mean, like I said, this is, I think this makes a ton of sense and I, I wish I would have, you know, focused on this sooner because yeah, I mean that, and that's kind of freaking dough. But so the, I, I was in banking before I bought this franchise and I, I sold interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives. So I was always, you know, trying to find ways of feet of financing essentially. And I'm very transparent with my customers for the most part as far as, you know, telling them, hey, you know, this is what we deal with on a, on a daily monthly, you know, weekly, daily monthly basis, especially with insurance companies and the lack of, you know, timely settlements on their end, etc. So what I, I will do from time to time, if it's a, you know, it's a, if it's a, a customer that I know is got.
Christian Sheerer: You.
Charles: Know, the financial means to, to do it, we will, you know, see what their thoughts are of paying us up front with a credit card and not assessing them a fee and allowing them to get, you know, whatever points or whatever they want and then they just pay themselves back once the, you know, the check comes and it clears, etc. So, so in that case we, you know, we eat the fee, which, you know, let's, if it's a, if it's a ten thousand dollar, you know, bill, it's not, you know, it's three hundred bucks or whatever, so. Or six. Is it something like that, six hundred dollars, something like that. Anyways, it's, it's, it's nominal at the end of the day. It's, it's not a situation where we, we have to go out and find a, somebody to buy our receivable and discount it, you know, by 40% and pay us, you know, 40 cent or 60 cents on the dollar for it or have a line of credit set up and tap into our line of credit which has a, you know, usage fee, etc. So if we can get the customer to do that, then we will. So is there a way to turn that off if that's the case in those situations?
Christian Sheerer: What, the fee? Yeah, yeah, you can always, you can always. On a per customer or per invoice basis. You can eat the fee if you want. Okay.
Charles: Yeah, I mean that's the only, that would be the only. Do that all the time. Time.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, people do that all the time. Got it.
Charles: Okay. Yeah, I mean, I'm, I mean I would definitely like to try to move forward with that and see what we can do to, you know, get that implemented.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, I mean, super simple. I mean, I would just say. Okay, so when, when do you, do you have some transactions that you would think are coming up soon?
Charles: I mean, we definitely have a few coming up. I mean there's, I've got like $45,000 in receivables right now.
Christian Sheerer: So.
Charles: We'Re just waiting, waiting on, you know, checks to come through. So some are coming, some, a few of them are coming to me, but most of them are coming to the customer. So whenever that happens, they get it and then they pay it.
Christian Sheerer: So. Okay, cool.
Charles: Cool. Yeah, the reason that I could probably.
Christian Sheerer: Oh yeah, go ahead.
Charles: I've got a small little job that I, I'm picking out or she's going to give me a deposit here in advance of it so she can secure the date because we've been relatively busy and I just don't want to have a situation where she's, you know, her job gets pushed aside because it is small and we lose her spot. So when customers give me a deposit, it secures that date no matter what. And if, you know, if I have to pick up more, you know, manpower as a result of that, then I. I just do it because, you know, because of the deposit. So.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, I got you. I hear you. Yeah, that's smart. So. Yeah, I mean, I think that. What. The reason I asked is because that maybe we run that one as, like, the first kind of, like, rollout one and a couple more after that, and then we can get back together after those have cleared. Do you think that would go out? When would that go out? Like tomorrow or next week?
Charles: It could. I mean, I could. I could. I mean, I need to send it out, like, today.
Christian Sheerer: Okay.
Charles: So. But I. I mean, but I could wait till tomorrow and just.
Christian Sheerer: You could start it today. I was just. Honestly, I was. I thought I would be a little bit too ambitious if I, you know, asked you to sign up today. But you could really do it. I mean, I've seen people get set up within an hour and. So did you want to. Yeah, you could send it out today, and then it would. And then do you want to get back together after that's been cleared? Like maybe sometime Monday or Tuesday? Tuesday or Wednesday?
Charles: Yeah, I mean, that would work. How so? Because I. I've got to run out here in just a few minutes. Okay. How quickly would it take to get things done? Because, I mean, I could do it when I get. Once I get back.
Christian Sheerer: Because I. Yeah, it's like. I mean, honestly, max, if you really are tinkering with it, like, max. Like two hours. So like an hour and a half. Like, and that is even a long time, you could do it much quicker than that.
Charles: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: It's literally just. You create an account, put your business info in so that we know it's. You put your bank account information in so that we know it's. You link up to QuickBooks, and then you can send out. And then that invoice, if you had already created it in QuickBooks, it'll just sync over to nickel, and you can send it out in the way that I showed you, or you just send out the payment link.
Charles: Okay. Yeah, let's. I mean, I think this is definitely worth. Worth looking into and seeing what we can do to, you know, get it implemented. And.
Christian Sheerer: I just.
Charles: I wish I would have looked at this sooner.
Christian Sheerer: All good. Yeah. I mean, so no time like the present, right? Whatever.
Charles: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: And do you. Do you. Do you want to set up some time for early next week just to get back together after you've made that first couple transactions?
Charles: Yeah, let's do. Let's do that. Like, Mondays are usually the busiest days for me, so. Okay. I would say it would be preferably, you know, the likes of Tuesday.
Christian Sheerer: All right. Does the same time work?
Charles: Yeah. Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: Cool. Yeah, let's do Tuesday at this time.
Charles: Okay. All right, perfect.
Christian Sheerer: Got it. I'll send that over, and then I have another call to hop on in a second, but I'll send over a recap of what we chatted about. And then when you get done from where you're. When you're. Where you're going, feel free. Take the time to sign up, send out that first invoice. We'll see it on our end. If there's any questions, hit me up. I can help out. Our support team is also available. And so, yeah, after that, we'll get back together on Tuesday.
Charles: Got it.
Christian Sheerer: Okay.
Charles: All right, perfect.
Christian Sheerer: Cool. Really nice to meet you.
Charles: Yeah, nice meeting you. And I appreciate it. Thank you.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. Really appreciate it. Yeah. Thanks for taking the time. I think. I think we're. I think we'll have a good, good little partnership here.
Charles: Yeah, No, I appreciate that. And, yeah, I mean, if I can save. Let me just see. I was going to save. I know you got to go, but I'm going to pull this up. Just copy. And that's a lot of dough.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah.
Charles: And I. I can only imagine, you know, what it's been over the last, you know, couple of years, so. Which, you know, doesn't make me happy because it's like, gosh, I mean, we're profitable, but, I mean, this would be even more profitable.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. Yeah, I know. I mean, we.
Charles: We.
Christian Sheerer: We've saved companies like, you know, 20. Upwards of a hundred thousand sometimes, too, and they don't even think about it.
Charles: Got it. Okay. All right, perfect.
Christian Sheerer: Cool. I sent that out. And I'll. I'll see you on Tuesday. But if anything comes up in between, then as you're getting set up, let me know and we can. We can troubleshoot it.
Charles: Okay, Sounds good.
Christian Sheerer: All right, Charles, you have a good one.
Charles: You, too. Thank you.
Christian Sheerer: Of course. Thank you.
Charles: Bye.
