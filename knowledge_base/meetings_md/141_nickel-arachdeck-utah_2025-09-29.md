Jacob Greenberg: Hey Jack, can you hear me? Hello. Hey there, how's it going? Good,
Jack Rodosky: how are you?
Jacob Greenberg: I'm doing good. Just getting my camera set up here. Awesome.
Jack Rodosky: Yeah, my camera kind of goes in and out sometimes, so I might pop out. But I'll be
Jacob Greenberg: here. Yeah. All good. All right, cool. I'm happy we can make some time to connect today. Yes,
Jack Rodosky: absolutely.
Jacob Greenberg: So I have 30 minutes on my calendar. Does that still work for you?
Jack Rodosky: Yeah, perfect.
Jacob Greenberg: Actually, I have 45 minutes here. Perfect. Okay, great. Yeah, so I reached out because about a month and a half ago now at the convention that you guys had in the Midwest, a couple of different people had started using Nickel on their own. And then one of the franchise owners, Ryan, gave a presentation about Nickel. And then we've just had a huge influx of Archadeck users coming in over the last month and a half. So I'm reaching out to anybody who attended or maybe didn't attend and didn't get the information. so that I could follow up with some more details and see if it might be a fit specifically for you guys and let you know kind of how we do what we do.
Jack Rodosky: Cool.
Jacob Greenberg: Typically, I just kind of start by like understanding more of what your current ARAB process is. And then I'll give you a quick demo of Nickel. And then we can talk about if it would make sense to fit into your current process.
Jack Rodosky: Yeah. So we just use QuickBooks. It's kind of the standard for Archadeck. And we haven't made any changes to it, honestly. So yeah, that's kind of where we're at, honestly. But
Jacob Greenberg: yeah,
Jack Rodosky: love to hear more. Yeah,
Jacob Greenberg: so currently you guys are sending out your invoices from QuickBooks and getting paid via QuickBooks Pay?
Jack Rodosky: Gotcha.
Jacob Greenberg: Would you say the majority of your, like, what is the split of the types of payments you're receiving? Is it mostly checks or ACH or credit card?
Jack Rodosky: It honestly, like, I'd say it depends on, like, the neighborhood. honestly like um like kind of like up in park city we definitely get more cash checks um and then then also just a lot of ach yeah i'd say those are kind of our main main ones
Jacob Greenberg: okay cool do you know off the top of your head your current rates on quickbooks i know that they're moving everybody to standardized rates but depending on like when you started using quickbooks it might be different right now. Yeah,
Jack Rodosky: no, I'm pretty sure we're on those standardized rates. They're
Jacob Greenberg: on like 1.75%, I think, per transaction.
Jack Rodosky: Yeah, that sounds right. I can check. Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, gotcha. And then can you estimate in like a given month how much money you're taking in via ACH roughly?
Jack Rodosky: Probably around... 30 30 probably on average probably around like 30 to 50 000 and now some weeks a lot or some months a lot more some a lot less
Jacob Greenberg: oh yeah okay cool sounds good all right yeah so this is a very straightforward use case i think like this is why architect users really love nickel is because most use quickbooks most are getting hit with the quickbooks fees in QuickBooks directly integrates with Nickel off the bat. So let me just walk you through this really quickly. How long have you had the Architecht franchise up there?
Jack Rodosky: This will be our third year. Nice.
Jacob Greenberg: Very cool. Do you have any co-owners or is it just you?
Jack Rodosky: Yeah, so it's me and my uncle actually. And he admittedly does a little bit more with... the uh like quickbooks and all that but he is babysitting his grandchildren so i'm uh holding down the fort this week nice
Jacob Greenberg: okay cool awesome yeah and if you guys have any questions as a team and want to come together and talk through implementation stuff i'm always available for you guys yeah
Jack Rodosky: i'm definitely going to take a bunch of notes and then i have a call with him uh this afternoon and then um i could reach back out you know this afternoon or tomorrow morning
Jacob Greenberg: All right, I'm just going to jump into and start showing you the platform. If you have any questions at any point, don't hesitate to interrupt me.
Jack Rodosky: Cool.
Jacob Greenberg: Here we go. Can you see my screen right here?
Jack Rodosky: Yep.
Jacob Greenberg: Awesome. All right, so this is the Nickel platform. So once you log in, you'll be able to access this page. This will be a summary of some of your recent transactions, but the transactions tab is really going to be an overview of everything you guys see. So one cool thing here is that it's actually a little easier to navigate and filter through than QuickBooks. So if you just want to have one tool to focus on all the cash flow of your business and then one tool to focus on the actual bookkeeping for accounting records sake, Nickel is really helpful for that for a lot of Archadeck users. Some people just use us to send out the invoices. Some people will use us just to visualize everything better and download reports. So all this is easily downloadable by CSV. If you need a CSV record. Before I hop too much into this, I'm just going to show you quickly on the account settings tab down here. Once you log in with Nickel, I'd go directly to here, upload your branding and, you know, your image and your banner and all this. So that's what your customers will see on the portal. But I'd link your QuickBooks account under this integration step. Once you do that, it takes about five to six minutes, depending on how much data you have, for the first sync to happen. but once that's complete everything else is immediate one-to-one so when you come to the transactions tab all of your historic or future invoices that you've already generated within quickbooks will automatically populate here anytime anything is sent from nickel and that transaction is completed it will automatically update in your quickbooks so there's no need to there's no extra step involved so from here you'll be able to see in basic information like the date the amount. what account it's going to and coming from, whether it's a receivable or a payable, invoice number or the purpose, and you can easily come in here and flag any transaction, reconcile that transaction, or add a note. For you, the transactions will be automatically reconciled because you use QuickBooks, so it's not too much to worry about, but it's really easy to filter by company, customer, purpose, invoice, etc. Now the invoices tab is where you guys will probably be living the most to save the most amount of money. I'm going to show you this little Easter egg really quickly before I pop in. This is just kind of a side thing that we'll offer here at Nickel. But once you create your account, which you can do at the end of this call for free, you'll be able to generate this portal. So it'll have your company name, it'll have your logo, it'll have your branding, and you can plug that directly on your website. And it's pretty customizable. So for example, I think these guys were the ones that I worked with most recently. They've just added like a payment step up here on the top of their screen. Okay. You click on it, you could go ahead and make a payment and it will move forward to, oh, this is their outdated one. It moves forward to like a custom screen. So like
Jack Rodosky: you'll
Jacob Greenberg: be able to ask unique questions and get unique information from customers. to be able to reconcile with your books. Now to create your invoice, this will typically be done from within QuickBooks the way you're doing it right now. So you'll add the line items within QuickBooks and it'll just generate and populate within Nickel. I'm just going to show you what it looks like to create one within Nickel so that I can walk you through the process and show you what the ultimate result looks like. And I'll send one to myself so I can open it up. Or is it you or your uncle is primarily sending out the invoices?
Jack Rodosky: uh primarily
Jacob Greenberg: him joshua so yeah his process really wouldn't change um for the creating of invoices all this will be automatically populated based on that invoice that's created within Circleback one thing is you guys can create recurring invoices typically architect users we work with don't have recurring invoices it's usually one time you'll have the invoice date and the due date with net terms. Do you guys have a typical net terms that you work with to collect payments for?
Jack Rodosky: Yeah, typically like are you asking like what's the breakdown or like yes it's usually 20% at our 25% of contract signed and then 20% when we get everything approved and then 20% when we get materials and then the rest. when we do a final walkthrough. Okay,
Jacob Greenberg: so you have four different payment stages.
Jack Rodosky: Yeah, and then also sometimes customers are like, can we do it blank way? And as long as we get enough money to buy materials beforehand, we'll do that. We're pretty flexible.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. I'm just putting these notes here to show you what it looks like to add these notes to the customer page but when you do create those invoices right now is it like you create four separate invoices for those four different payment stages and then you go into QuickBooks and reconcile them Okay, cool. A couple people use Nickel in a couple different ways. It's really customizable based on your preference for this workflow. Some people will continue to do that within Nickel. They'll continue to send out one individual transaction for deposit, one at the end for balance, whatever happens in between. And they'll just manually take note of what that transaction is. Some of our customers, however, will send out entire invoice for an entire project off the bat if you have it scoped out. and allow the customer to pay partially each of those installments. So it's really up to your preference. You can continue to do it the same way you do right now. Let's see. Inside this invoice, when you generate it within Nickel, it'll automatically attach the line item invoice that's generated by QuickBooks, so you don't need to worry about adding it. But you can also upload any other documents you want. So if you have like a net terms agreement, hey, you have to pay within 30 days, you have to pay within 60 days, you can add that here. If you have photos of the project and you're charging them at four different stages or you're using the same invoice and updating it throughout the different stages, you can add it into this portal. Just makes it really easy to consolidate communications around the project and around that individual transaction.
Jack Rodosky: People
Jacob Greenberg: use this to varying degrees. I just attached a sample invoice here. and on the advanced settings, you can enable the customer to edit the payment amount. So this is how some of our users who will send out the entire invoice up front,
Jack Rodosky: collect
Jacob Greenberg: 20% upon deposit, make that happen. So I've created the invoice. One thing I can do with a nickel is if I have that customer information, I could automatically charge that method on file. Or I could send out the payment link via email or via text message. So this is sending out the invoice. Do you guys collect your customer information in advance when you have these filling or is it just you send out the email and they fill it in? So
Jack Rodosky: we send it out and they fill it in.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, great. So this is always an option for bigger projects when you onboard new customers. We have like a really sleek flow for them to go through that process and provide it to you through Nickel so that you guys don't have to store it and deal with like PCI compliance and legal issues. We take care of all the security and compliance for you. Or you can just enter their cell phone or their email. send it out the way you've been sending it so far.
Jack Rodosky: So
Jacob Greenberg: I'm going to send out this to my email, ignore my messy inbox here. Make sure I send
Jack Rodosky: this through an
Jacob Greenberg: email. So I did. So the invoice will populate like this right here. My Wi-Fi's been weird today.
Jack Rodosky: And then when you're talking about how you can upload like an invoice, could you upload like multiple documents? Because you generally have like a proposal, like in contract and then like an invoice, if that makes sense.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, you absolutely can. So when multiple documents for that individual transaction
Jack Rodosky: or
Jacob Greenberg: one. you can so i've uploaded this one file i can continue to upload more stuff if i want to yeah
Jack Rodosky: just because like it'll be a lot of like uh you know we'll be talking about like you know material orders plus like the uh proposal so yeah cool that makes sense gotcha
Jacob Greenberg: me one second Thank you. It looks like my demo environment is having a hard time right now.
Jack Rodosky: Oh, good. Let's
Jacob Greenberg: see. Give me one second here, Jack. I'm just going to reboot this. Cool.
Jack Rodosky: Yeah, no worries. Hey,
Jacob Greenberg: Jack, sorry about that. No
Jack Rodosky: worries.
Jacob Greenberg: My demo environment is giving me a hard time, so what I'm doing is just getting some screenshots from a live, like, actual environment so that I can share it with you. Perfect.
Jack Rodosky: Cool.
Jacob Greenberg: But, yeah, so you will be able to upload. any amount of documentation per invoice that you want. And like I said, you'll be able to accept payments incrementally. So people can edit the exact amount. But the gist of this here, here, I'm trying to share my screen again. Here we go. Just so this here is that the email will come in looking like this. It will have your company name and your company logo here. Any of the attachments are also included in the email and they will be in the payment link as well. Then when you go ahead to select pay now, you'll be able to, it will pop up like this. Hold on one second. I'm just going to share my screen to this as well. Can you see this here? Yep.
Jack Rodosky: So once
Jacob Greenberg: you click on the link in the email and ignore these blue lines, it's just because we selected it to take the screenshot. It'll come to this invoice that'll have your branding and your logo here, who it's coming from, any of the notes that you wanted to include on this invoice. And beneath the payment amount here, it's actually going to show all of your historic transactions with that individual. So if you did send, if you do have a project that's $10,000. They're able to come into the invoice amount, edit it, and change it to $2,000 to pay that deposit.
Jack Rodosky: Then
Jacob Greenberg: it will update to $8,000 and they'll be able to see their historic transactions. And they'll be able to pay it incrementally over time. They also have the option here to do an express checkout with Apple Pay, pay by card, or pay by bank. So you can toggle this on or off. But the real big highlight of kind of like the nut that we're trying to crack here is by offering your customers the ability to pay however they want to pay. without it affecting your bottom line or time to deposit. So what we do here is you present to the customer that you're able to pay by bank for $10,000 for this one transaction, and it's completely free. Alternatively, if they did want to pay by card, it would be a 2.99% fee on the customer, and that will automatically reflect here in the total of that amount. So your Archadeck business doesn't have to pay credit card fees or ACH fees anymore. completely remove that. But you give the customer the option to pay. Most people say, hey, we don't charge credit card because we don't want to pay credit card. And we also don't want the customer to have to pay credit card. We found that 22% of the time, businesses that weren't charging credit card and then start to use nickel, 22% of the time, their customers prefer to pay in credit card just because it's like a cash flow advantage for them. They'll have longer than 30 days to pay at all. And most people have 2% to 3% cash back cards at this point anyway. So it kind of nullifies the additional fee but once that happens and once that payment is made we'll go back into the nickel environment really quickly wrong screen here sorry i have too many screens up
Jack Rodosky: i know what that's like
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, let's see. Here we go. Once that payment is made, that invoice will move from the active section here into the completed section here. And you'll be able to see the amount that's been charged to them and the amount that's actually been paid, see if it's been overdue or if it's been completed, and you can send out that request for payment. So one other thing that I like to highlight is if you have any unsent invoices, you created a bunch of invoices within QuickBooks, they'll auto populate here. Just filter for unsent invoices and you can select them all and just send them automatically. So if you have multiple at a time, you can shoot that out. And it makes it easier to track when it went out, if it's been paid, if it's been opened and track all the notifications around that invoice. You
Jack Rodosky: have
Jacob Greenberg: any questions about that process?
Jack Rodosky: No, I think you did a pretty good job of explaining it. Cool.
Jacob Greenberg: Do you think that this is something that would be easily implemented for you guys or have a positive impact? Yeah.
Jack Rodosky: I mean, like the, like everything on QuickBooks being able to like populate in there is definitely was a concern. And then obviously the lack of fees are definitely good, but like I definitely need to kind of talked about it with my co-worker a bit more but um yeah cool
Jacob Greenberg: um sweet the co-worker that you talk about it are they the are they like responsible for doing is it your owner yeah so it's
Jack Rodosky: like yeah so it's like my uncle we're like co-owners uh-huh and um yeah he sends primarily primarily sends out all the invoices i I do a lot more sales. Cool. But I did take a lot of good notes, so I'll be able to transfer some information, I think.
Jacob Greenberg: Nice. All right, cool. Yeah, I mean, for you guys, it seems pretty straightforward. You have a pretty easy process to adapt this to. It looks like if you are doing between $30,000 and $50,000 a month, you're paying at least $700 a month just in fees.
Jack Rodosky: I
Jacob Greenberg: suspect it's higher. And this can also just add some time savings and coordination for you. As far as paying bills, do you guys always pay bills in the same way? Do you have like sometimes credit cards, sometimes ACH? Yeah,
Jack Rodosky: I think it's all the same way. And again, I think it's probably a bit dated. But yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. Yeah, on the bill pay side, we... really just save a lot of time and organization. You can do a lot of customization. So if you guys do your franchise fees, you can auto pay your franchise fees on a certain date from within here. You can give managerial approval for any bills that are going out. So it's easier to manage. And yeah, it's completely free ACH or credit card, however you decide to pay. Cool. Cool. As far as connecting internally with your, what is I, what is your uncle's name? So that I have some
Jack Rodosky: Matt. Same last name.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay. Gotcha. When you and Matt connect, do you have like a timeline in mind I should be aware of for like when you think you'd want to roll this out?
Jack Rodosky: So, I mean, a lot of that is kind of up to him as far as like how he wants to kind of focus out the last part of the year because once it starts snowing out here we can't do a whole lot of building
Jacob Greenberg: so that's
Jack Rodosky: when we primarily would do a lot of like organizational changes or
Jacob Greenberg: okay changes
Jack Rodosky: and stuff like uh we're in like mainly production mode right now but um i will certainly have a better idea of that this afternoon and um i could shoot you an email then
Jacob Greenberg: yeah for sure as far as getting going i'll just let you off the bat. Here's the pricing stuff here.
Jack Rodosky: So
Jacob Greenberg: I'd recommend just signing up and getting going today, like creating the account. So it's in the back pocket. It's free to do so. When you guys are ready to start processing larger transactions, you can upgrade at any time. But really, the steps are create the account, sync your bank account, sync QuickBooks. In those three steps, which should probably take 10 minutes maximum. you'll be able to get going without any like hiccups or change in your process. And so all you guys are currently doing is QuickBooks Pay and sending out that invoice. So it really takes 10 minutes to get going. For Nickel Core, it's free to sign up. The difference between Nickel Core and Plus is it's a one day faster turnaround time for Nickel Plus, two days versus three days for Core, for ACH, and it's next day turnaround for credit card Nickel Plus, where it's two days for Core. And the big feature here is that if you're doing transactions that go greater than $25,000 per transaction, you're going to want to be on Nickel Plus eventually. That's capped for Nickel Core at that $25,000. But besides that, they're relatively similar. You can schedule payments in advance and do recurring payments with Nickel Plus as well. For getting set up and for tinkering around and for having a conversation with your uncle, it's definitely helpful to have the information in front of you and see what it looks like. And there's no cost to do that. So my recommendation would be signing up today to get it to move forward. Otherwise, I'm happy to. Set a reminder on my calendar for us to just check in, see how it's going. And if you or your uncle have any follow-up questions, I can just save time to answer them.
Jack Rodosky: Cool.
Jacob Greenberg: Yep. So let me throw a reminder on my calendar for, it's going to say two weeks from now, but that is Columbus Day. How about October the 14th? Does that make sense for us to reconnect?
Jack Rodosky: Yep. I had a 4 p.m. Mountain time meeting that day, but anytime before that, I'll be good. All right,
Jacob Greenberg: cool.
Jack Rodosky: That's because you're East Coast, right? Yeah, I'm
Jacob Greenberg: East. I always have to Google it, even though I do it every day. It's
Jack Rodosky: two hours ahead, so I don't think that would affect you at all.
Jacob Greenberg: Let's do 2 p.m. your time then. Would that be all right?
Jack Rodosky: Perfect.
Jacob Greenberg: Awesome. All right. I'm going to send out that invite now. All right.
Jack Rodosky: All
Jacob Greenberg: right, cool. Great.
Jack Rodosky: Thank you.
Jacob Greenberg: Happy we connected today. Yeah. You have any more questions before I hop off here?
Jack Rodosky: I do not. Thank you.
Jacob Greenberg: You got it. All right. I'll send out that invite for two weeks from now. And if you create an account in the meantime, feel free to reach out. Also happy to save that time. You could add Matt to the call and I could walk them through it once more if you'd like.
Jack Rodosky: Cool. All
Jacob Greenberg: right. Cool. Talk to you.
Jack Rodosky: Yep. Have a good one.
Jacob Greenberg: Bye.
Jack Rodosky: Bye.
