Abbas: Thank you. How are you, Colton?
Colton O'Farrell: I'm doing really well. Did you also have a chance to speak with, my colleague Jacob by chance, or is this the first time you've spoken with someone from Nickel?
Abbas: Actually, somehow I had it at 10:00 and I missed it.
Colton O'Farrell: Jesus. We noticed there was, two meetings that came in. I just wanted to make sure you didn't also have a meeting with my colleague. If if you haven't, no worries. That's, you know, we've figured that out on our end. I just wanted to make sure, you haven't spoken with anyone yet.
Abbas: Sure. There was a lot of conflict here today at my meeting. There was 12 meeting with assigned for me, and I see a lot of conflict. Can I get you on hold for a second? Let me just let the people know that I cannot join the other meeting.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah. Yeah. Of course.
Abbas: Alright. I'm all yours.
Colton O'Farrell: Awesome. And I'm I'm pronouncing your name correctly. It's Abbas?
Abbas: Abbas. Yes.
Colton O'Farrell: Awesome. Well, like I said, really nice to meet you. I did see a note in here that you were looking to discuss, like, processes processing fees and rebate percentages. Curious. Are have you created a Nickel account? Are you actively, using Nickel yet?
Abbas: No. We haven't.
Colton O'Farrell: You have not yet?
Abbas: Okay. No. But I do have different companies that I'm working with, but I'm just, you know, reviewing what's out there to see who's offering the best, and we'll take it from there.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah. Absolutely. Well, I'm just curious, Abbas, how did you find out about Nickel? What brought you here? What do you know about us so far? If you were to, like, rate your knowledge from one scale one to 10, kinda where would you self assess yourself?
Abbas: I think, online, I was just browsing about the services and your name came up and then I reached out.
Colton O'Farrell: Awesome. So you you haven't done too much digging on on what we're able to do and provide?
Abbas: None at all, honestly. No. No worries. That's what we set up this meeting.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah. Yeah. No. Exactly. So I'm I'm helpful to fill in the gaps there. It is helpful to know what you're doing today from so you're looking it looks like to use us from an accounts receivable perspective or kind of investigating that aspect?
Abbas: Accounts receivable, accounts payable.
Colton O'Farrell: Oh, for both. Okay. Cool. Yeah. And what are you doing today then? What what's your ERP? Are you operating on QuickBooks Online?
Abbas: QuickBooks Online.
Colton O'Farrell: Okay. Awesome. We have a native integration, so that makes it very easy.
Abbas: I saw that. Yeah.
Colton O'Farrell: What what does that process look like for you today? So are you generating the invoice within QuickBooks online, sending that off to your customer? They're paying it. You're doing, an ACH, like, transaction?
Abbas: We are mostly, actually accounts payable that we are looking for and some accounts receivable. But, mostly, it's account about, payable. We have about 1 to 1 and a half million dollars in invoices that we pay our vendors that right now we're using currently at Emilio, and we wanna see what other companies are offering right now.
Colton O'Farrell: What so you said you're using, Mello today for for AP? And then what was the the volume that you're doing with them?
Abbas: 1 and a 1 and half million a month.
Colton O'Farrell: 1 and a half million per month?
Abbas: Yes.
Colton O'Farrell: Got it. And what is that rate that Melius offer you offering you today?
Abbas: Two and a half and ninety days ninety days and a 90% discount that they are right now advertising.
Colton O'Farrell: What what was the percentage rate? It was
Abbas: One half percent.
Colton O'Farrell: 2.5%?
Abbas: Mhmm. Sorry. One moment. Sure.
Colton O'Farrell: And what, so, you know, you're working with Mello. Is it the additional fees that are associated with that? Besides that 2.5%, what what else are they charging you for doing the AP with them?
Abbas: That's it. They don't there is no other fee for us.
Colton O'Farrell: And then you said a ninety day float compared to, like, a forty to five day float?
Abbas: Sure. And then the rebate that we get.
Colton O'Farrell: And what is that rebate?
Abbas: I have a different company that are that are offering the different rebate, and we are trying to see what is the best and who is offering the best and the return rebate that we would like to, you know, make a decision and move forward with one company.
Colton O'Farrell: And what is the, like, the best the offer you've gotten for the return rebate yet?
Abbas: Unfortunately, we don't disclose that. You can send me your offer, and then we review all of them. We make decision. Who is the best for our company and we move forward?
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah. I'm happy. So just to to clarify, I'm not entirely sure what we offer from the rebate aspect. I did reach out to the team, so I'll let you know. But regarding the the volume you're doing, you know, we absolutely are able to, I've already pinged leadership just letting them know what you're doing and what your, your situation is with Melio, but that information is kind of required just for me to be able to get because they're likely gonna ask what you're doing from a a rebate perspective. We we do take it on a case by case basis. Like I mentioned before, though, you do have the volume that we are absolutely willing to negotiate the rates. Happy to answer any other specific questions you have besides those pieces. I can walk you through the platform. I can explain kind of the some of the pricing models, our security compliance elements. I did wanna point out are you familiar with g two? The outline.
Abbas: Go ahead. No. Go ahead. Explain it to me.
Colton O'Farrell: Yes. So g two, it's more in kind of in the tech and software software space. But if you look up Nickel, you will find, so it's like an online verified review site. It's like the gold standard, when it comes to software solutions. You will see on there that Nickel was branded ranked as the number one easiest payments platform to use. Believe we have, like, a 4.9 out of five rating on there. We have over 10,000 customers who are using us for accounts payable, accounts receivable, or both. A part of the comp those customers actually come from Mello or bill.com or some of these other solutions. And, Mello had changed their pricing model, so it sounds like you've probably been working with them, I would imagine. So, like, around a few years, five years or so?
Abbas: No. It's not actually that long. The a year ago.
Colton O'Farrell: Oh, just a year ago. Okay. Well, interesting. They actually they they, you know, must cut you a nice deal when it came to the accounts payable
Abbas: and things. Mhmm. Yeah. We were grandfather of those deals that
Colton O'Farrell: I gotcha. Yeah. Most customers do not have that set up with them. And, therefore, we have a lot of people who come to us specifically around the free ACH. Are you doing anything when it comes to ACH transactions today?
Abbas: Everything everything is ACH. We don't send check. Everything is ACH.
Colton O'Farrell: For accounts payable, you're not paying via credit card?
Abbas: Yeah. We pay for a credit card. Yes.
Colton O'Farrell: Oh, okay. So so I was just, on our end, it's it's either ACH or it's or it's credit card transactions?
Abbas: Sure. Yeah. ACH and credit card. We pay it with the credit card.
Colton O'Farrell: I got it. So you're not doing, like, an ACH trans like, transfer to your bank or, via, like No.
Abbas: We use credit card and then we ACH it to our like, basically, repay our vendors that they do not accept credit card, then we pay them with the Amelio, and they wire the money on our behalf, and we pay with the credit card. And our fee for the transaction is 2 and a half, and I'm looking for the better return on the rebate, which are everybody's becoming very aggressive. I can see everybody is providing a diff aggressive pricing on the return rebate to earn the account. So if you wanna talk to executive and see what they can offer to me and email it to me, I'll be happy to, you know, consider that and to set up another meeting. But, basically, this is the business that we have. I'm looking for the different company to provide different solution with the better fees and rebate that we can switch.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah. Of course. No. That makes sense. Did you also want to, like, do a walk through of the of the platform? I'm happy to do that now, explain those aspects. I also have, like, a prerecorded video I can send to you.
Abbas: A walk through. No. Until no. Until we don't have the deal, I don't wanna spend more time. If you could just talk to the executive and finalize the numbers and get back to me. And if it was something that it was on for us, it was okay to move forward, and then we get the training, and we get to spend those timing.
Colton O'Farrell: Okay. Yeah. Of course. Did you were you able to share how many companies you were talking with or, like, how many offers you're looking at, like, or reviewing?
Abbas: I have 12 meeting. It's all about that today. Office set up it for me.
Colton O'Farrell: Got it. So you're review reviewing 12 providers for this?
Abbas: I believe just for today, I don't see anything tomorrow. I I give them my whole day today to finalize this, and I believe there are 12 different company that I'm talking to them and and, you know, see who offering a better rate.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah. Of course. And, you know, that rate is top of mind. What I would really stress though is if you look on the reviews for a lot of these providers, you will see that it is very hard to get support and assistance there. That's one thing that we really pride ourselves with and have a lot of customers who come to us. I would poke around on those providers that you're talking with on g two. That particularly, you cannot hide bad reviews. And if you look up Mello or you look up some of these other providers there, it would be interesting to see what what their g two reviews compare with Nickel. Like I mentioned, we are the easiest payments platform to use and ranked by them, really high reviews. I need to do some research, and dig in within the team to see what we're able to put together for a potential solution. I'll email that over to you. If it's of interest and you'd like to have another conversation, more than willing to do that. I'll also share that demo video just so you can have it and review on your own but, yeah, appreciate your time, Abbas. Looking forward to, connecting.
Abbas: I'm looking forward to your email and the information. I will take it from there.
Colton O'Farrell: That sounds great. Well, appreciate
Abbas: your time. Thank you. Appreciate as well. Looking forward to doing some business with you guys.
Colton O'Farrell: Likewise. Bye bye.
Abbas: Thank you. Bye bye.
