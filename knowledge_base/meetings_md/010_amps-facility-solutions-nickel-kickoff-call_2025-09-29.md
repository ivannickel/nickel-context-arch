Colton O'Farrell: Hello, Diane. Hi.
Diane Fenimore: How's
Colton O'Farrell: it going today?
Diane Fenimore: Good. Can you hear me
Colton O'Farrell: okay? I sure can. Yep. I got your volume coming in all right. How about on your end? Can you hear me all right? Yeah,
Diane Fenimore: perfect. Awesome. Well,
Colton O'Farrell: Diane, I just want to thank you so much for making some time today to meet with me. I know that you guys have been utilizing the solution from the transactions I've reviewed, which looks awesome. I know I spoke with James a couple weeks ago, and he told me that you would be the main person interacting with the system. Just wanted to ask what insight you have into Nickel. Have you been utilizing the solution much so far? And I guess what kind of immediate questions do you have?
Diane Fenimore: So unfortunately, I guess I never accepted to join the team.
Colton O'Farrell: So
Diane Fenimore: I have not. I messaged him this morning, but I guess he's tied up today. So I haven't actually looked at it yet. Yeah,
Colton O'Farrell: let's get that solved then.
Diane Fenimore: Okay. Perfect.
Colton O'Farrell: So I'm going to get you. I do have to, so I can. Okay. Yeah, because the
Diane Fenimore: link expired when I tried to do it, you know.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep. No worries. I'm sending you a new link with the same permissions that you had. So you should just get that in a moment here.
Diane Fenimore: Okay.
Colton O'Farrell: I think I heard it.
Diane Fenimore: Yeah, it came
Colton O'Farrell: in.
Diane Fenimore: I joined the team. Okay. Okay. So I create my own password then on this, I guess? Yep,
Colton O'Farrell: you'll follow through with the steps and complete what you need to do to set up your account. Okay. Okay,
Diane Fenimore: looks like I'm
Colton O'Farrell: in. Awesome. Do you want to try logging in for me? Just make sure that you can get into the platform, okay? Okay.
Diane Fenimore: You mean like sign out and re-log in?
Colton O'Farrell: Are you signed in right now to the platform? I'm signed
Diane Fenimore: in right now, yeah. Perfect.
Colton O'Farrell: You want to go ahead and hit on the Zoom here. There's the green share button at the bottom. If you want to share your screen and just be logged into the platform, I think that'd be a great place to kind of walk through some things.
Diane Fenimore: Do what now? On the Zoom,
Colton O'Farrell: I can do a share? Is that what you're saying? Yep. So if you're on Zoom, you go to the very bottom with all the tabs. There's a big green button that says share. If you click that, then you can click on the window that you want to share. Oh,
Diane Fenimore: okay. Nickel right here. Share. Perfect.
Colton O'Farrell: Okay.
Diane Fenimore: It's
Colton O'Farrell: loading for me. Awesome. Okay. I can see this all right. Let's first pop in and I'm going to get, I have some annotation tools. Here they are. Awesome. So first we'll go to this account settings there. Okay.
Diane Fenimore: I need to touch it.
Colton O'Farrell: If
Diane Fenimore: you want
Colton O'Farrell: to just click in there. Okay.
Diane Fenimore: And
Colton O'Farrell: if you scroll down, yep. So this looks all good. I believe James set all of this up. Yep. If you want to click this get paid tab for me. Okay.
Diane Fenimore: And then
Colton O'Farrell: by, so by default, Nickel has it set up so that when you send an invoice to your customers, if they want to pay for that via credit card, they're going to pay
Diane Fenimore: that
Colton O'Farrell: 2.99%
Diane Fenimore: fee. We
Colton O'Farrell: want that default rules set up and kept that way. It looks like.
Diane Fenimore: Yeah, I think he's, let's see how much credit cards you want to pass on. Oh, a hundred percent. Okay. Do
Colton O'Farrell: you ever, Diane, ever have customers who make partial payments with you guys? Do you allow for partial payments? that's what that last field there that says edit payment amount so allow your customers to edit your requested payment amount to short pay or make multiple payments is that something that you guys ever do or do most people usually pay in full
Diane Fenimore: um they're going to be paying in fulls my understanding
Colton O'Farrell: okay cool
Diane Fenimore: James has pretty much been doing all of this. James did all of this. I think he is going to push it over to me. But I work part-time for him right now. So I think that's why he wanted me to just get real familiar because then once it will be real easy. Because right now we're just using it to pay the vendors, obviously.
Colton O'Farrell: On the AP side, right?
Diane Fenimore: Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I'm a vendor too in here.
Colton O'Farrell: So has he paid you via Nickel yet? Say
Diane Fenimore: that
Colton O'Farrell: again? Has he paid you via Nickel yet? He did. Yeah, and it flew
Diane Fenimore: through fine. Perfect.
Colton O'Farrell: That's so awesome to hear. Well,
Diane Fenimore: if
Colton O'Farrell: you want to scroll up on this page, then it looks like everything's set up there correctly.
Diane Fenimore: We
Colton O'Farrell: will go to the members tab.
Diane Fenimore: Okay.
Colton O'Farrell: Which you're on there. So we have you set up. Perfect. Administrator. Everything looks good there.
Diane Fenimore: Oh, good. Okay. Yeah. He said he had done that. And then Sherrick is his son. Yeah. Okay. Perfect.
Colton O'Farrell: Okay.
Diane Fenimore: Awesome.
Colton O'Farrell: And then right now, so if you want to click the plans tab, this
Diane Fenimore: might
Colton O'Farrell: be more of a James thing, but just wanted to let you know, if you scroll down just a
Diane Fenimore: little
Colton O'Farrell: bit, you're
Diane Fenimore: going
Colton O'Farrell: to
Diane Fenimore: be currently
Colton O'Farrell: on the Nickel core plan, which is the free version with us. I have some notes. Let me check those.
Diane Fenimore: Oh, here it is. I was going to say, I printed the one page flyer out yesterday.
Colton O'Farrell: Oh, awesome. That's awesome.
Diane Fenimore: So I figured that's the one we were using. Yeah.
Colton O'Farrell: So you've reviewed that one page flyer?
Diane Fenimore: Oh, for sure. Yes. And I went and you had sent like some tutorials or YouTube videos. So I looked at those as well.
Colton O'Farrell: Oh, awesome. So you're really educated and ahead of the curve.
Diane Fenimore: Yeah, I wanted to, that way I knew. Yeah. Yeah,
Colton O'Farrell: perfect. Well, now that you've seen the videos, you've logged into the platform and you have access, you'll be able to kind of test out some of the things that you've seen. It sounds like you're you mostly are familiar with the the plans, but if basically showing you this, so if at any point you guys need to upgrade from the free version to the plus
Diane Fenimore: version,
Colton O'Farrell: whether that's invoice size, recurring invoice, if you're looking to do debit authorizations, you can come to here into account settings
Diane Fenimore: and
Colton O'Farrell: try for 14 days. We give all customers a two-week free trial of that. If for whatever reason it's more than you need or you guys are fine with the core plan, you can always revert back. uh but
Diane Fenimore: basically
Colton O'Farrell: what that Nickel plus version does is it removes any of the limitations that you have on the free plan we
Diane Fenimore: access
Colton O'Farrell: ach faster we bump up your limits and just some more kind of advanced functionality there um yeah
Diane Fenimore: that's right because i did see what is oh 25 000 limit yeah that should be fine i don't think we're transactions
Colton O'Farrell: and that's unlimited so you can do a thousand of those you just cannot do one at twenty six thousand dollars on this right
Diane Fenimore: basically
Colton O'Farrell: okay
Diane Fenimore: yeah the only thing is maybe yeah if he if he wants more than three of us on here that would be obviously then that would kick it up too so um
Colton O'Farrell: let's see are you guys expecting yeah i'm trying to think i spoke with them um on september 16 with james just reviewing some of the notes here i know you're waiting on some prime uh contracts from like the uh counts receivable side so it looks like
Diane Fenimore: maybe
Colton O'Farrell: in play but later on
Diane Fenimore: for sure Okay,
Colton O'Farrell: cool. That looks good there. Let's go ahead and click on the notifications tab now. Okay.
Diane Fenimore: And
Colton O'Farrell: if you want to click this arrow down for me.
Diane Fenimore: Oh, okay. And
Colton O'Farrell: then we're going to scroll down to the bottom. So right now, so we don't have anyone in this contact email. And these are all different. aspects so sounds like james is going to at least be notified for those um if there's any kind of issue you know relevant to like there's a refund if there's payout you know per those specific
Diane Fenimore: oh okay yeah
Colton O'Farrell: if you want to be added to on there for any of those as well i'd recommend adding your email address but this uh this one right here this contact email
Diane Fenimore: anytime
Colton O'Farrell: a payment link is sent out and this is more on the accounts receivable side you could list somebody to essentially yourself or james so that you're seeing on the communication i would get it and you just be cc'd
Diane Fenimore: any
Colton O'Farrell: of these are things that uh you would like visibility into or relevance um i would go ahead and just add your email address to these as well okay
Diane Fenimore: yeah i'll check with him on that like you said if it's strictly for ar we aren't even using that yet so But probably he will do that.
Colton O'Farrell: Right. Exactly. I'm
Diane Fenimore: just making some notes.
Colton O'Farrell: No,
Diane Fenimore: no worries. Okay.
Colton O'Farrell: That's much appreciated.
Diane Fenimore: Awesome.
Colton O'Farrell: So those are the ones that are most relevant to you. But
Diane Fenimore: yes, we'd like
Colton O'Farrell: to have a conversation with James about what would be helpful
Diane Fenimore: for you
Colton O'Farrell: to have on here. But otherwise, we'll scroll up to the top.
Diane Fenimore: Okay. Yeah, it looks like he pretty much did most of it, which is fine.
Colton O'Farrell: No worries. Let's go ahead and click on. the security tab quick
Diane Fenimore: so you
Colton O'Farrell: guys don't have two-factor often authentication
Diane Fenimore: enabled
Colton O'Farrell: uh would recommend turning that on so this one would be specific for your account basically what this is going to do is it's just going to send a code either to your email or to your phone when you
Diane Fenimore: log
Colton O'Farrell: in and then you just type that in essentially so um something you might want to enable but
Diane Fenimore: All right.
Colton O'Farrell: And then the last one, integrations. So you guys aren't operating with, you're operating on Zoho Books. Is that correct?
Diane Fenimore: Yeah. And there's
Colton O'Farrell: no QuickBooks running in the background? No. Got it. So, okay. Yeah, this tab won't be really relevant for us right now, but possibly in the future. But if you want to go ahead and go to the bill pay now for me. Okay.
Diane Fenimore: perfect
Colton O'Farrell: so this is the so this bill pay is the accounts payable section the get paid that's the account receivable uh okay so if you need to let's go ahead and click on your vendors right there yeah
Diane Fenimore: i was kind of curious about this okay so there he's got them okay
Colton O'Farrell: so there's yourself as well i see in
Diane Fenimore: there yeah and
Colton O'Farrell: it looks like we have Let's
Diane Fenimore: see if there's more. I would have thought there was more. Yeah, there is. Okay.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah. Looks to be about 11 of them in there. If
Diane Fenimore: you
Colton O'Farrell: need to add another vendor, it's very easy to do. So you would just go click that new vendor button there. And we'll go ahead and just add myself as like a, so you can have it to test if you'd like to. So you can go ahead and click the new vendor.
Diane Fenimore: Where's the new vendor? Right
Colton O'Farrell: on this part here. Oh, sorry, right this button right there.
Diane Fenimore: Oh, is that like the more? No, I think because this is in the way. Is that why? Possibly
Colton O'Farrell: could be. So on this vendors page on the top
Diane Fenimore: right,
Colton O'Farrell: there's a like a maroon button that says new vendor with a plus sign. Okay.
Diane Fenimore: Yeah, I think I can't get. Let's see. Hold on. Let me look. Can I move this? Let's move this. Oh, there it is. It was hiding behind the video chat.
Colton O'Farrell: It happens to me all the time. Okay,
Diane Fenimore: there we go. So
Colton O'Farrell: we're going to just do like myself. So what we're going to do is we're going to go click this. So this is what you would do to enter, add a new vendor. So you're
Diane Fenimore: likely,
Colton O'Farrell: unless you have their payment information, we're always going to select this no option that says ask the vendor to fill it out.
Diane Fenimore: Yeah. Okay.
Colton O'Farrell: I want to just go ahead and select that. We'll add myself just as like a dummy test version if needed for you. The
Diane Fenimore: no ask vendor?
Colton O'Farrell: Yep.
Diane Fenimore: Okay. And
Colton O'Farrell: then you're going to type here, just type in Colton. So Colton.
Diane Fenimore: And then
Colton O'Farrell: just put in parentheses like Nickel demo or Nickel test. Oh, sorry, for in the vendor name box. Oh, okay.
Diane Fenimore: Okay. Perfect.
Colton O'Farrell: And then for email address, you can put Colton, Colton, at. Get nickel.com. Okay.
Diane Fenimore: And
Colton O'Farrell: then we're just going to scroll down to, Oh, actually you want to hit enter for me.
Diane Fenimore: Oh,
Colton O'Farrell: there we go. Now we'll hit this invite button.
Diane Fenimore: The screen. Okay.
Colton O'Farrell: Request
Diane Fenimore: your vendor to log into the bank. Sure. Payments vendor successful and require. We only, only allow ACH payment, prevent them adding a check delivery message. Okay. So I think he might be doing that. I would think, trying to think when he sent it to me, you know, what it required.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah. So it looks like you've already filled that out. So actually, let's stop sharing button just for me, just for a moment. I know you have a little bit of familiarity with what the screen looks like. Okay.
Diane Fenimore: I
Colton O'Farrell: can actually probably. Oh
Diane Fenimore: yeah.
Colton O'Farrell: awesome all right so i'm going to go ahead and share my screen whoops Let's see. And can you see my screen okay?
Diane Fenimore: Let me make it full sense. Ah, there we go. Yes. Perfect.
Colton O'Farrell: So this is the email that you just sent me. So
Diane Fenimore: we're
Colton O'Farrell: setting up for any of your vendors. You've likely already filled this out yourself before, but it's basically just going to say, yep, here we're looking to set you up as a vendor so that we can pay you via Nickel. There's those
Diane Fenimore: free
Colton O'Farrell: questions with answers. So. basically letting them know that we have bank level security, built-in fraud protection, we're audited quarterly, we're protecting all of their information, and we're always moving funds through FDIC insured accounts. But basically, I just go to fill out vendor details. There's those frequently asked questions and answers again, if they didn't read that on the first page. So this would be like, you know, me filling out my information here. I don't actually even have to fill out this information to be. added is a vendor within your account so you can still see that i'm in there you can still do like create a um a bill to be sent to me at any point
Diane Fenimore: but
Colton O'Farrell: i have not added like my address or payment details it's not gonna like let you submit that but
Diane Fenimore: okay we
Colton O'Farrell: can but essentially that's just adding me to your account so that in case you want to try to do any kind of test transactions you'll be able to do that
Diane Fenimore: but go ahead
Colton O'Farrell: and stop sharing for just a moment Awesome. Perfect. So it looks like that was working right. Awesome. Let's go ahead and click on.
Diane Fenimore: Mm hmm. Let me find
Colton O'Farrell: my annotate again. Here it is. Let's go ahead and click on the bills tab right there. Oops. Oh,
Diane Fenimore: okay. and
Colton O'Farrell: then we're going to go for uh let's click the queued for payment
Diane Fenimore: um let me move this queued for payment okay so
Colton O'Farrell: currently don't have any queued for payment but let's click that paid in full i bet we have some completed there yeah
Diane Fenimore: because we just did a bunch perfect awesome
Colton O'Farrell: so when do the next uh bills need to be paid essentially when when are you expecting to have to do your first bills through Nickel diane
Diane Fenimore: i'm not sure if he'll have me do it in october or november but yeah usually it's mid-month so once a month is when i think he's doing these so
Colton O'Farrell: awesome okay cool that makes sense
Diane Fenimore: See if we go to all, that'll just show us everything. Yeah.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep. Yeah,
Diane Fenimore: because you see, he just paid the August. So I think he's doing it, you know, in between.
Colton O'Farrell: Awesome. Well, hey, everything looks set up on my end. Your account looks good to go. Let me just ask, are there any other questions that you have for me or particular, like, scenarios that you might experience? Happy to, like, shed some more light or if you just have questions about Nickel. It looks like you have everything set up in here correctly. And if you don't have to make payments, at least until maybe middle of October or starting in
Diane Fenimore: December,
Colton O'Farrell: unfortunately, it won't be too many for us to kind of test through. But it looks like the ones that you have done and received yourself, sounds like those have all worked well. So
Diane Fenimore: let me ask you this. In order to pay somebody, so let's just say like myself, do you have to create the bill first? first and then pay it yes
Colton O'Farrell: so when you go to create a bill it's going to first ask you who you want to pay who that bill is to so you're going to select the value
Diane Fenimore: i'm going to go in here that way i can see it okay
Colton O'Farrell: so you're going to select the vendor typically you want to have the the vendor created first and then you go to create the bill this is to yourself you just enter the payment amount in here Reason
Diane Fenimore: for payment.
Colton O'Farrell: And then if you have any PDFs or attachments that you want to add, you can just drag and drop those. You'd click make a payment. The next thing it's going to ask you is do you want to make this from your bank account or do you want to make this with a credit card? If you pay bills with a. direct or with a bank or ACH direct deposit sort of situation. Yeah.
Diane Fenimore: Let's say I'm going to go into it.
Colton O'Farrell: I'll
Diane Fenimore: cancel. Yeah,
Colton O'Farrell: exactly. You just,
Diane Fenimore: yep.
Colton O'Farrell: So you just select the payment method. So if you get
Diane Fenimore: this dropdown
Colton O'Farrell: arrow, I'm not sure if you guys have a credit card added.
Diane Fenimore: No, it looks like that's the only thing he's got. That's the only option he has. I
Colton O'Farrell: got
Diane Fenimore: you.
Colton O'Farrell: If you scroll down to the bottom, it basically just tells you what that, that timeframe.
Diane Fenimore: Right. Okay. Let's
Colton O'Farrell: cancel.
Diane Fenimore: Okay. Cool. Okay. That's looks very easy. Oh, I got to get rid of the open balance now. Let me get rid of that bill. He'll be like Diane Weiser bell in here. And
Colton O'Farrell: you can just click it. You can just, you can just click into it. And then there's that delete button.
Diane Fenimore: Oh, perfect. Okay.
Colton O'Farrell: Cause
Diane Fenimore: I'm, I'm learning Zoho books. I don't know if you're familiar with Zoho, but I'm a QuickBooks girl. So.
Colton O'Farrell: So
Diane Fenimore: to learn Zoho has been a little challenging for me. Yeah. Curious,
Colton O'Farrell: what's been kind of the most challenging aspect from Zoho? Or just curious, we have a lot of customers who use QuickBooks, less that use Zoho, but we do have some. Just curious what your experience has been with them. I
Diane Fenimore: think, well, something I ran into last weekend that kind of continued this weekend is if you're in the middle of like a reconciliation and you want to make a change. Even if it's not like cleared, it won't let you do it. So I had to literally delete the reconciliation I had started and go back, which was kind of annoying. And the other thing is because this looks easy as far as you put in the bill and then you pay it. Well, you have to do two steps. So enter the bill and then enter the payment. So I have found a workaround that you can do it. And it's like kind of in the same screen, you know. But that was kind of challenging and, you know, just like learning the program in general, you know. So, but yeah, slowly I'm getting used to it. That's great
Colton O'Farrell: to hear. It sounds like, you know, you've done a lot of research with Nickel and seemed trained up on everything. Seems like you, this will be a lot easier for you to use than Zoho, at least it sounds like. So don't have to add this
Diane Fenimore: to
Colton O'Farrell: your bucket list of things to learn here. But didn't call out, Diana, I'm not sure if you've already tried this yet, but if you go ahead and click that Help Center box.
Diane Fenimore: OK. And
Colton O'Farrell: you hit this messages tab. OK. This is how you can speak with the Nickel team directly. So you just send us a message that would go to myself and the customer success team. It goes to our engineers, goes to our customer support team. You can always reach out to me via email as we've been communicating. I am in a lot of back-to-back meetings sometimes. So I always try to get to my emails within 24 hours. But if you're looking for an immediate response, this is where I'd reach out to do that. We generally are getting to somebody from the team will be responding to you within 10 minutes.
Diane Fenimore: Within
Colton O'Farrell: kind of normal business hours, we do have people that are monitoring outside of business hours, but within business hours, generally about a 10 minute response time to talk to a human. So
Diane Fenimore: yeah, I had to use that for Zoho a couple of times when I was setting stuff up for him. Perfect.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah. So it'll be the same kind of workflow with us. And hopefully, yeah, it's just a quicker response time than maybe some of the other companies that you when you've had to request support. But yeah, this is all I have for you, though, Diane. I want to thank you again for us making time to just kind of review your account, get you trained up. I'm really excited for you to complete those first bill payments next month.
Diane Fenimore: Yeah.
Colton O'Farrell: We can, you know, if there's anything that comes up in the meantime. feel free to reach out to our team but uh looks like you're all trained up and ready to go so okay
Diane Fenimore: yeah i mean it looks very um very user friendly which is great now if i want to delete you out of here do i just just
Colton O'Farrell: click on it and
Diane Fenimore: oh there you go delete okay i'll just delete you out of there that way okay perfect yep wow yeah no this looks very simple and you know what this gives me some information that i've been waiting on as far as with these vendors because it's been kind of hard getting there. contact information and that kind of stuff so if i look in like this one here you know at least i've got their their address you know
Colton O'Farrell: so
Diane Fenimore: you can see
Colton O'Farrell: through the you can see their active bills if there's any unpaid so right
Diane Fenimore: yeah that's great okay now it looks very user friendly i appreciate the quick training session because that way i'll be ready to go when he wants me to be absolutely
Colton O'Farrell: Well, it was a pleasure speaking with you today. I hope you have a wonderful rest of your week. And yeah, we'll be supporting you along the way. If any questions come up, feel free to reach out to us, though. All
Diane Fenimore: right. Sounds good. Thanks, Colton.
Colton O'Farrell: Have a good day.
Diane Fenimore: You
Colton O'Farrell: too.
