Christian Sheerer: And straight from you, what made you want to spend your morning talking with a salesperson?
Tiffany Smith: That's a good question. So basically we're using QuickBooks online for processing payments, the accounting stuff. And we've been using Intuit QuickBooks. But unfortunately, our volume has increased tremendously in the last six months or so. And that we can't keep up with the ACH fee. So we were looking for something that was doing free ACH. We don't mind the credit card fee because we are charging that to our clients. So it's just the ACH fee that we're trying to eliminate from QuickBooks from Intuit with QuickBooks.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, your volume went up. What was the change? Both was the actual change and why did it happen, do you think?
Tiffany Smith: Well, we're growing, we're expanding. The company has expanded to for new markets across the United States. So we went from just Alliance New York. We now have another company called Trusthouse. So now we have Trusthouse New York, and then we have Alliance and Trusthouse New Jersey. We're also in Florida, and now we're extending to Connecticut. So it's just been a lot of volume that's been coming in across the board. So my department, we process all the payments and do all the billing, so that's That's pretty much what happened in the last six months. I will just give me one second. Let me pull up my report so I could tell you how much more we increased. So as of August, the ACH volume was 1. For 76 million.
Christian Sheerer: Up until August.
Tiffany Smith: Yeah, that was the last reporting from August. Previously we were at 600 to 800,000. So it pretty much doubled.
Christian Sheerer: Oh, well, I mean, it's a problem that you got to pay the fees on that, but that's a good problem.
Tiffany Smith: Yeah, it is. It's a great problem to have.
Christian Sheerer: And are you guys paying like 1% on that?
Tiffany Smith: Yeah, we're paying 1% but a max of $8 per transaction.
Christian Sheerer: Okay. Yeah, because 1% is like what, like $11,000 of that? And then so if it's like max of... And so how many, you know, what are the actual like average transactions like in terms of dollar figure?
Tiffany Smith: It can be 500 all the way to 20, 50,000.
Christian Sheerer: Okay. Okay. Yeah, we have no issue. It's just sort of good to get a range for us. And when you say, you're passing on those fees on credit card. How does that process work? Are you just like adding another line item to the invoice or your invoice or.
Tiffany Smith: Yeah, we have a, we, we, the system that we use for invoicing, they have automatic, we, we charge 3%, an automatic 3% being charged to the client. So it's automatically calculated on the invoices.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, so you don't, it's not, it's not that sometimes when I talk to people, they, they're saying that, you know, They send out an invoice and then somebody comes back and they say, I want to pay with credit card. And then they have to like edit the invoice and then add it up.
Tiffany Smith: It's just, oh no. So basically when a client, when we have a new client, they sign a agreement, client service agreement. And then with that there's a credit card authorization form or ACH form. So from the jump when the client starts services, we know whether or not they're paying with credit card or ACH.
Christian Sheerer: I hear you. Okay, yeah, that makes a lot of sense. Okay. And is it usually people, you know, recurrently paying or is it just one, let's say, one off?
Tiffany Smith: We have both. So majority of our clients are long term. So we have weekly billing that they're paying weekly. And then we also have, you know, the clients that only come in for one week of services or. So it's, it's a combination of both, but majority of them are on a weekly or recurrent basis.
Christian Sheerer: So yeah, okay, so you're okay, so the billing is weekly, sorry.
Tiffany Smith: Yeah, everyone we're billing as we speak right now, every Wednesday.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, cool. So there's a mix of like just sending one invoice for a big project and then the, sorry, speaking of projects, there's like a construction going on on the main road next to our office. So they're like banging stuff into the floor. And it shakes. I'm like, are we in an earthquake? Are we gonna fall into the middle of the ground? We might.
Tiffany Smith: Right.
Christian Sheerer: Man-made earthquake. Okay, so some people are just getting paid one in or, sorry, getting sent one invoice and then others are on some recurring basis for different types of work.
Tiffany Smith: Yeah, something I do wanna highlight is that we process payment, we don't send a payment link. So we have authorizations from the clients to do a keyed in transaction. So yeah, so basically we are the ones that are putting in the credit card information.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, awesome. And we do both. So up to you.
Tiffany Smith: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: And you can port over that. So you're still going to use QuickBooks Online, right?
Tiffany Smith: Yes.
Christian Sheerer: Awesome. And yeah, we would just be replacing that bit. So QuickBooks Online, really good ERP accounting system. That's their bread and butter. That's what they do. And they just figured, hey, we'll make 1% of every transaction that people want to do and make it right there and force you guys to use it. People will like Alliance Home Care and whatever. But that's not something that they're primarily focused on. I'm sure it's a lot of revenue for their business. And so we map up into QuickBooks Online for their ERP, and then we can push data back and forth, automatically sync it so you can still continue to create your invoices in QuickBooks and then come over to Nickel and just hit send. And it's just going to take maybe like a couple of, you know, upfront minutes really of communication with your customers of like, hey, you're going to get 2.99% rather than three when you pay via credit card here. It's going to be more advantageous for us. We're going to be able to grow quicker, do more home care for you, whatever. And, thereafter once they pay it through Nickel or you're just payment authorizing for them, right? They don't even have to think about it, I guess.
Tiffany Smith: Yeah, because just to jump in, a majority of our clients are elderly. So I don't know if you look into what we do, but we are a home care provider. So none of them are going to use the payment link. Let me be transparent with you. We try to get into it. Maybe once we had one client that the daughter click the link to make the payment. But what happens is that we know this. So that's why it's, we have the authorization from them for us. So basically what we do every Wednesday is we charge, we, we generate the invoice, we charge them right away, and we send them the invoice with a credit card receipt. So there's no probably, like, every once in a while, we'll probably use the payment link to send it to them, but everything is done. On our side and then we just send them a copy of it.
Christian Sheerer: Brilliant. Okay. Okay. So let's just, yeah, let's, I'm very clear on how, and I mean, we'll transition to this part of the conversation. Part of what we do is also accounts payable. So if you have vendors that you regularly pay, sort of the idea behind Nickel is, right, we really went deep on the payments, I guess, infrastructure or like architecture is sort of how I describe it. And then we laid over that deep payments architecture. That we've spent a lot of time thinking about. Our founder came from Stanley Black & Decker, and our other founder came from Airbnb, and he helped build the payment system over at Airbnb. So they've spent a lot of time thinking about payments, whereas the Intuit QuickBooks payments is just like a particular add-on. And so we sort of take the perspective that if we had one place that we could offer to businesses for pretty fast turnaround times, pretty cheap on the fees, and then just kind of have all of the data live in one spot, accounts payable and accounts receivable, then we're going to be able to solve a lot of problems. Like maybe usually we say we spend, we save people around, I mean, in your case, like around probably around seven, ten thousand dollars a year, as well as a couple hours every month just by making that kind of foolproof.
Tiffany Smith: I don't know how much we're going to use the Pebble side because right now we're using Ramp and I know the AP, the person who does the AP, she loves Ramp, so it's kind of hard.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, Ramp's great. Ramp's great, yeah. I think the difference between us and Ramp and why it might make sense just from understanding what you guys do as a business is, We're built for those large transactions. If you tried to put $50,000 through Ramp, they'd be like, what's going on? They'd have to get your owner to authorize it, all that stuff. And so we go up to $1,000,000 per transaction. You don't really think about it. And so then because we're doing that large scale type of transaction very often with a bunch of companies of ours, or customers of ours, then we can offer that ACH for free pretty quickly.
Tiffany Smith: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: And so when you come in into Nickel, this is what you'll see from the first bit and you just go into account settings and you link your QuickBooks account.
Tiffany Smith: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: As soon as you do that, all the open invoices are just going to pull over from QuickBooks so that you can just go in quickly and go to get paid, which is what we call accounts receivable here. And send them over like right away, right?
Tiffany Smith: Okay. I do have a question with that. How does funding work? Is there next day funding after payments are processed or what is the process with that?
Christian Sheerer: Oh, like what's the turnaround time?
Tiffany Smith: Yeah. Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: So depends on the payment method. So on this invoice here, I'm charging the payment method that I have on file. I'll add their customer payment method. I'll add their card or their bank account information and you can upload that authorization document. For new customers, you can also send an authorization document through Nickel so that they have it ready to go because obviously they need to be able to consent to you taking it out.
Tiffany Smith: Right.
Christian Sheerer: And if it's a credit card, it's a one day turnaround time. On ACH, it's two day turnaround time and those are business days.
Tiffany Smith: Do businesses. Okay.
Christian Sheerer: You'll get a notification right away that it's been paid or that the process is underway. And you'll also get a notification when it clears and comes into the account. And you also will get a notification.
Tiffany Smith: If.
Christian Sheerer: They'Re insufficient funds or like the payment failed or something like that.
Tiffany Smith: Right. I was going to ask you that. How long does that take? Is it within the two days or it could be later?
Christian Sheerer: Oh, no, that's more instant.
Tiffany Smith: For ACH or for?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, yeah. The notification that, hey, this is ready to go and they've paid you, that's more instant than when it actually clears is because that has to route through our banking partner, Federal Reserve, et cetera, and then go back into your account. So the notifications are like, at the time that the transaction is made, right? And then the actual money, you know, plus green in your bank account plus in QuickBooks Online, that's two business days.
Tiffany Smith: Okay. And then what happens when there's a return? Because, you know, for instance, ACH sometimes returns if there's insufficient fund or the account number is incorrect or something like that, like how soon Do we know?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. So I'll show you kind of the notifications that we can have. So merchant is going to be you. Payment failed. That'll be, I don't know exactly the timeline on returns/refunds. I would assume it's probably quicker than the turnaround time if it's failing, right? We wouldn't take money from an account that has insufficient funds. The payment would just fail. But let me take that away as homework for you to put that into an email for you because I honestly, it doesn't come up too much. So I don't know off the top of my head.
Tiffany Smith: Yeah, it comes up. We probably have one or two a month that it happens to. And right now, the issue into it is that Intuit has next-day funding for ACH. So we don't get notified until like a week later that it failed. So I just wanted to know like what was the timeline with that.
Christian Sheerer: Okay.
Tiffany Smith: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: No, no, no. I'll pull that together for sure.
Tiffany Smith: Okay. Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: I don't know off the top. I don't want to spitball and give you a wrong answer.
Tiffany Smith: Right, wrong answer.
Christian Sheerer: But all of these notifications happen at the time that the payment happens. Like payment happens. Or except for this one, right? That's like when- It's probably- sorry, except for this one, that's when it's been sent and kind of cleared in the bank account.
Tiffany Smith: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: The customers will also get one.
Tiffany Smith: Yeah, we're probably going to turn that off because we don't want to, I guess, bombard them because they're already going to get an email from us. A lot of clients, we're very- We have very particular clients because you'll find that we have a list of a lot of exceptions. Like some clients want mail, mail, they don't want any email. Again, because we're dealing with the older generation, so they have their way of doing stuff. So yeah, we usually, the same thing we did with QuickBooks, we turned off the notification because they were getting alarmed and we were getting calls like, Hey, you already sent me an invoice and a receipt. Why am I getting another email?
Christian Sheerer: Things like that.
Tiffany Smith: Oh yeah, you can always toggle these off. Yeah. Okay.
Christian Sheerer: Or some of them off, some of them on.
Tiffany Smith: Okay. So everything is fully customizable, which is good. Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: Is it just you on your team who's handling this stuff or you have a couple other people who would be users?
Tiffany Smith: Yeah, we have four in total, including me. Four?
Christian Sheerer: Awesome. Okay. Yeah, you could just add them in if you want to be the administrator, which has full access, invite more managers that can just transfer funds or another member who can just see stuff. You can add everybody in here. Depending on how you guys have permission set up in your team, Yeah, that way.
Tiffany Smith: Yeah, I do have a question. How does billing work for you guys? It like, do we get like a statement at the end of the Sorry, I got a message that just threw me off. Do we get a statement by the at the end of the month or is it like daily? How does it work?
Christian Sheerer: Oh, billing for us.
Tiffany Smith: Yes. Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: End of the month, but it's only $35 a month.
Tiffany Smith: Okay. No, I'm talking about like the credit card fees and stuff. Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: So credit card fees. Okay. Yeah. So we could talk about this too. So let me, I'll walk you through sending an invoice with a credit card authorization. And we'll cover all that. The credit card fees are defaulted to pass to the customer. Without adding a line item or doing anything else and without tripping over any kind of surcharging laws in any state, right? Because we're the merchant, we're like a service provider that's handling the payment so we can charge that 2.99% fee onto the customer without you having to do any math to add that to your invoice, right?
Tiffany Smith: What if we don't want to do that? We want to leave it as it is right now where It's already on the client's invoice and it's included in the total. Can you turn that off? Oh, okay.
Christian Sheerer: Well, I'll show you.
Tiffany Smith: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, I'll show you. So if I send like a, you know, deposit number for whatever the number is like, and I can do recurring every week. I mean, that's going to be a lot of money every week, but every month, every quarter, every year, this is for my customer that I'm sending this out to. Or I'll just do that one time so you can set up either way. The invoice documents that you may have got created by QuickBooks will automatically populate here or you can add new documents if there's, I don't know, proof of work stuff that you want to add, anything you want to add, you can send over here. And then we're going to charge the payment method on file, add the customer payment method. It'll show that there's just a 2.99% fee. Put in their details and then pay it out. I'll show you what it looks like on the link just to show you what the line items together will look like. I'll send this link to myself and one sec. And so this is what a customer will see if they use that link and it'll help demonstrate what it looks like when they're just paying by card. So it'll just be those fees added to the payment amount.
Tiffany Smith: To the payment. Okay, got it. Okay.
Christian Sheerer: And for each of those customers, you could always come in and say, Hey, I got a new customer. How many Christians do I have in here when we have 13? And I'll set up the payment authorization and either you can enter it if you have it already, maybe you guys have a big bank of them, right?
Tiffany Smith: Right.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, cool. And then if a new customer comes in and you want to add it through Nickel, you can add it this way and you can request it from them or enter it in yourself. And set up the type of terms of that type of authorization. So like if there's a max amount that you want to say, hey, we're only going to take at max 20,000 out of your account at one time, we're going to set expiration date to never or to four years.
Tiffany Smith: Right. Okay.
Christian Sheerer: Or whatever. Or you could set no transaction limit and then you just got to give them Hey, debit authorization up to.
Tiffany Smith: Question regarding that.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, go ahead.
Tiffany Smith: Do we have to send that message to the customer? Because I saw like there's like, can you go back? I saw like you put like a message in.
Christian Sheerer: Now I gotta make 14. Yeah, so memo is required. Is there a reason you wouldn't add a message there?
Tiffany Smith: Because we don't want to send it to the customer.
Christian Sheerer: Oh, well, I mean, yeah, you could always enter their payment information if you have it.
Tiffany Smith: Oh, okay. So I don't have, oh, so that's a request. Okay. Yeah, if we already have it, because it's already a part of the contract that they signed. So 90% of the time we're going to have it. Okay. So we don't have to do the request from the customer. Okay, I got it. Because I think I didn't see that part where it says request for the customer. Okay.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, yeah, either or. You have that's why I mentioned, oh, you guys might have a bank of this information already. Like you might have a bank of information. Yeah, exactly. Exactly.
Tiffany Smith: Okay, got it. Okay, so how does it work with QuickBooks? So if I connect the QuickBooks account, all of the invoices that are open are going to be, I guess, automatically updated when I sign into Nicole?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, exactly. So I'll give you an example on bills, for example. So just like a quick switch in our heads, right? This is like vendor bills that are coming in, right? But same process for invoices for your customers. This icon here with the little QuickBooks guy is pulling that information from QuickBooks and all I have to do and Nicole is go in and make that payment, right? The invoice already came in for the bill amount, et cetera, and I just have to review it and pay it out, right? The same thing for invoices on customer side. So just imagine, imagine this one here that I'm highlighting came in from QuickBooks, it'll have a little QuickBooks icon and you just have to go in and request the payment or charge the payment method on file.
Tiffany Smith: Okay. Is there like a send back to QuickBooks? Does it update QuickBooks?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, yeah, it goes back and forth. It's what we call like a 360 integration in this world is like 360 means information comes in and goes back to the other, you know, it's right.
Tiffany Smith: Okay. Yeah, because that's one of the biggest thing. We just want to make sure that when we process of payment in Nicole, it automatically updates quickly.
Christian Sheerer: Oh yeah, it'll be the same time. I mean, a few seconds lags out and it's like another minute. But that's the yeah, that's, yeah, it's a couple seconds exactly.
Tiffany Smith: Okay. Yeah. And then for account setup and stuff. So right now with QuickBooks we have it's set up. Does it matter who's the admin in QuickBooks? Because right now, basically the CEO is the admin and then we're all users. It's a pain because when we have to make calls, there's an issue. We have to get him on the phone. So it's, does it matter if it's I'm the admin and it's connected to the QuickBooks account or does he have to be the owner, the main owner of the account?
Christian Sheerer: Actually a good question. I think as long as you can, link the. So when I link this, I'm going to show you what. What it opens up to. It opens up to a new window. So I just have to make sure that I can log in here.
Tiffany Smith: Okay. Maybe I should try because I have an account already. Yeah. Let me try.
Christian Sheerer: You have a nickel account already?
Tiffany Smith: Yeah, I signed up yesterday.
Christian Sheerer: Awesome. Okay.
Tiffany Smith: Yeah. Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: If you want to try now, that might. That's probably a good. Use of the end of our time just so we can troubleshoot that live.
Tiffany Smith: It looks like it worked.
Christian Sheerer: Cool, you want me to, you wanna, you wanna show me just so I can, we don't have to do anything. Yeah, I just wanna, I can like direct you where you would like send one out.
Tiffany Smith: Yeah, I just have to join the meeting on my computer because I have it on my phone. Just give me one second. Okay. I don't know how to get rid of this.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, cool. Yeah, you can always add your branding logo, stuff like that.
Tiffany Smith: Yeah, but it looks like it's there.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, cool. And if you go in and go in and get paid for me on the left. Far left?
Tiffany Smith: I'm sorry.
Christian Sheerer: Oh, no, you're good. Yeah, you'll just have to set up payments for this to see yeah, exactly.
Tiffany Smith: Cool.
Christian Sheerer: Then they'll start to sync over.
Tiffany Smith: Oh, great. That was easy enough.
Christian Sheerer: So yeah, I wouldn't do it now unless you're ready, but maybe we could do it in between now and when we get back together. That's sort of what we do is like we have you guys run a couple of transactions, but you would just request the payment there, right? So it's all pulling over.
Tiffany Smith: Oh, no, I just wanted to click on it to see what happens.
Christian Sheerer: Oh, yeah, you're good, you're good. But yeah, you would just request the payment there and like typically what we do. So yeah, it looks like everything ported over like correctly. And the previously completed ones aren't going to pull in because they're already done. Yeah, but the completed ones ones from now and into the future you'll see on that completed tab right there okay.
Tiffany Smith: Got it so that's one step so the credit card fee is 299 not 2.9 because I thought that's a 2.9.
Christian Sheerer: On yeah 2.9 if you guys are using a credit card to pay your vendors 2.99 for the customers to pay.
Tiffany Smith: You okay and then the HCH is completely free -uhuh. Okay. I think. I think I have everything I need. I just need. I guess whenever we meet again, we're gonna test. I just want to check to make sure that it's automatically updated in QuickBooks as we do payments.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, let's do this. Let's schedule some time, maybe, I think, like a week from now, because it'll give you enough time to have a couple of those payments go through and actually get fully ACH processed, credit card processed, et cetera. And you can run a couple of those transactions in between now and then, and then we can troubleshoot. And I have my homework for you to get to you by the end of the day today. And we can troubleshoot any things that come up. As well as just make sure that you're all set up and comfortable. Right. And answer any questions live then. And then thereafter, we can plan out if there's anything else that you wanted to chat through, maybe on the accounts payable side. I know you guys are using Ramp, but we can schedule that time then.
Tiffany Smith: Yeah. I do have a question. I guess I have to set up. Any. I lost my talk. The bank account. I guess I have to, like, connect the bank account to. To this so we can get paid through that. Like, if there's, like, a batch that needs to be paid to us.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, of course. Yeah, yeah.
Tiffany Smith: Okay. Just to confirm, are you guys integrated with. Because right now we're using a flag star, but we're switching to ocean first soon.
Christian Sheerer: It should be any bank. Yeah, any bank should be fine, frankly.
Tiffany Smith: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: That's based in the US.
Tiffany Smith: Yeah, they're all based in, I think, based in New York. Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: No, we work with a variety of banks. I mean, we work directly with the Federal Reserve, which obviously works with all the banks.
Tiffany Smith: Right.
Christian Sheerer: And so, yeah, so yeah. I I haven't found a bank that we didn't run into, but, yeah, it should. It should be.
Tiffany Smith: Should be totally fine. Okay. All right. I think I have everything I need to. To give feedback. We'll be in touch. I'll try to. I'll play with it some more. And if any question comes up, I'll email you.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, please do. I'll send you an email so you have my contact there. And let's schedule some time for.
Tiffany Smith: Do you want to try for next week? Yeah, let's do next Wednesday, because Wednesday is our billing day, so if I have a. I may have a transaction that we can do in real time. Yeah. Cool.
Christian Sheerer: Do you want to do it a little bit later? So, like, now rather than. Are you on the. You're on the East Coast, right?
Tiffany Smith: Yeah, I'm in New York. Oh, cool.
Christian Sheerer: We're in Brooklyn.
Tiffany Smith: Oh, great. Yeah, I'm in Queens right now, but our office is in Manhattan.
Christian Sheerer: Beautiful.
Tiffany Smith: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: So you want to do 11 30?
Tiffany Smith: Yeah, that's fine.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, cool. I'll send that over for you and then I'll give a recap of what we chatted about today plus the bit about the return processing timeline and...
Tiffany Smith: Right. Oh, and also can you find out if there's like a chargeback, not chargeback, return fee? Because I know right now Intuit charges $30 for a return.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, I got you.
Tiffany Smith: Okay, thank you.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, no problem. It was wonderful to meet you.
Tiffany Smith: Thanks. We'll catch up.
Christian Sheerer: It really was. But yeah, you have a good weekend. And yeah, if anything comes up, feel free to email me. If any tech stuff comes up, support is always available as well. And so, yeah, anything that I can put my head together around, I will.
Tiffany Smith: I do have a question because we haven't heard of Nickel before. So it's like one of those things where we did a ChatGPT. Question and it came up. Like, is it a new company? How long has it been in, in business?
Christian Sheerer: About three years.
Tiffany Smith: Okay. So it's pretty new. Okay. Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. We've really started to explode this year. That's when I joined a couple months ago, actually. I joined a larger, much larger tech company, and I was excited about this. And, and, I mean, I'm, like, excited about the product. I think it's, like, pretty into it.
Tiffany Smith: Yeah, it's great. It seems very. Great so far. Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: And, and, and we, you know, like, being early, we've been around for a while. We have, you know, thousands of customers, people used to spending a lot of money through the platform, but still being early, like, we, we value all that feedback. So, like, we can move pretty quickly. It's only a 10-person team, and so we can literally share feedback that comes in right away. And, and, and if it, you know, fits our priorities and we need to get it fixed, like, we get it fixed right away.
Tiffany Smith: Yeah, it's the same when I started at Alliance seven plus years ago. It was a pretty small company and now we're like big. I don't even know half of the team anymore but I get it. Yeah. Well, thank you for your time. Have a good day. I'll talk to you next week.
Christian Sheerer: Okay. During the week.
Tiffany Smith: All right. Thank you.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, awesome. Yeah, yeah. Feel free to reach out whenever.
