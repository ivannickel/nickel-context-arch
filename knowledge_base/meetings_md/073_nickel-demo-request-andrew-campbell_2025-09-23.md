Christian Sheerer: Andrew, what's up? How's it going?
Interpreter-Andrew Campbell: Good. How are you, sir?
Christian Sheerer: Doing well.
Interpreter-Andrew Campbell: Let me change my mic. All right. Hear me pretty good?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. Can you? Great. Can you hear me okay?
Interpreter-Andrew Campbell: Yep, I can hear you fine. Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: Cool. So we have 30 minutes. That still work for you? I guess 28 now.
Interpreter-Andrew Campbell: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, cool.
Interpreter-Andrew Campbell: I don't feel need that much, but yeah, go for you.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, I don't think so either. It's super, super simple to kind of walk through, just bucket out time. So at the beginning, I can learn a little bit more about what you're doing. Like, and I assume you have some clients you're doing like, interpreting stuff for.
Interpreter-Andrew Campbell: Correct.
Christian Sheerer: And I know you wanted to speak to us about payments because that's what we do, but typically what I like to do is I kind of get a sketch of what you guys are doing for payments currently, like, where you think that's falling short and. Well, I hope it's falling short because why else would you be talking to, like a sales guy? And then I can give you a background on what nickel does and we can go deep on the platform. It's super simple and kind of like, you know, really easy to pick up. So again, don't need that much time there. And then if it's all good, we can kind of get a game plan going of how we get you to get activated and start, you know, transacting and sending out invoices and stuff. But fill me in on. On what your payments looks like and how that fits into the larger business you're running.
Interpreter-Andrew Campbell: Okay. So when it comes to payments, generally speaking, what I've been doing or what I need. So number one, it's company of one. So there is no employees. There might be an occasional subcontractor.
Christian Sheerer: Is it a sole proprietorship?
Interpreter-Andrew Campbell: No, it's an llc.
Christian Sheerer: Okay. But now as a sole proprietor.
Interpreter-Andrew Campbell: Llc. Sole member. Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: Okay. Okay, cool, cool, cool, cool. Yeah, for some regulatory reasons, we. We don't support sole proprietors. So I just want to make sure I wasn't going to waste the rest of your time. So it's all. Yeah, yeah.
Interpreter-Andrew Campbell: So, yeah, I mean, I. Like I said, that's all I know as far as how I'm listed with the state and the federal government is that I'm an llc, sole member, which I can change in the future, but as of right now, it's just a sole member.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, cool.
Interpreter-Andrew Campbell: And so like I mentioned, I'm trying to figure out a way to use ACH to pay myself and then subcontractors in the future, as well as for payments to some of the services that I use, whether it be, you know, for my Internet or my insurance or. I'm trying to think of some other ones. You know, some things are annual, some are monthly, but just to kind of streamline, not having to write checks for those who don't want checks, but they either want ACH or some other form of non credit card payment.
Christian Sheerer: Got you. Yeah. And how do you currently do it when you, you just mostly checks now?
Interpreter-Andrew Campbell: Yeah, for the few that I have, I'll just write a check. There's a few. I do the direct bank draft, but those are few and far between. I just, I don't feel as comfortable doing it that way.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, it takes a lot of time. Both of those take a lot of time. Yeah. Cool. And how do you. How in the same way for when you get paid?
Interpreter-Andrew Campbell: Yeah, for the most part, I always push for direct deposit of some type. Not everybody can do it, but I always push for it.
Christian Sheerer: Is it through some platform or you're just, you're just sending account routing number over email or something like that.
Interpreter-Andrew Campbell: So it depends on the agency. So I work since I just became an LLC two, three months ago. I work for agencies that use like Bill, AP or they're huge enough that they already have it set up. All they have to do is give them the routing and account number and they do the rest. So I don't actually know what company they use, but the biggest one has been Bill.
Christian Sheerer: Okay. And so are you now as your own business owner, hoping to branch out into having direct clients where you'll send them an invoice and they'll pay you in some way?
Interpreter-Andrew Campbell: Correct.
Christian Sheerer: Beautiful. Okay, so we can set it up that way. Do you have like an accounting software already?
Interpreter-Andrew Campbell: Oh, I, I use Waze. As I be got to this point, I'm not as happy with Waze and I use an accountant as well, so.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, cool. The reason I ask is just because 90% of our customers use like QuickBooks online pretty cheap and we link up to them directly. But like it sounds like there might not be too much of a burden in terms of like the amount of transactions that you'll have so that you can kind of connect it to wherever you want. Because we can always, you know, allow for you to. Well, it is auto allowed. It's not like I have to turn on permissions for you, but it's. You can always download, you know, a CSV of the TR of the transactions that happen through nickel and then you Upload it and are doing accounting that way. The integration with QuickBooks Online just makes it super real time pass back and forth so you don't have to do that. I mean it's two clicks, download, upload. But that's why I go into that. So cool. I mean it's pretty simple. The, the story behind nickel, as I like show you the platform, I'll pull it up now, is that we were, and this isn't a deterrent for, for, because you know all types of businesses use nickel. But we were built for like industrial payments. So like our, our kind of idea was there's not really any software platform that's helping to kind of ameliorate all the pains of kind of having to use checks back and forth. And you know, the built world industries are stuck in the 20th century and you know, they're driving checks of $300,000 back and forth between their office and the bank and maybe going home with them, sitting them, sitting with them in trucks. And you know, you have to talk to somebody and say, hey, give me your account routing number and I'm going to store it on file somewhere because like this like security issue as well as just like a time inefficiency issue. And our founder came from Black and Decker and Stanley and was like hey, you know, if we built this out and our other co founder came from Airbnb and they're like hey, if we built this out for these large transactions up to a million dollars, then a lot of people like yourself who are doing different types of business can benefit from that too because you know, we'll have the free ach and do it in a secure and quick way. So anybody that you know has like a business to business transaction or like a person a business transaction, I think that like we can handle and it's all happening through like one secure payment link every time that you send an invoice. So if I'm, if I'm going into nickel and I want to say, hey, I'm going to send an invoice to whoever, I'll go in and I'll create a new invoice and I have all my customer information stored. And the information that we store is really not too much. It's just like their email and once they've put in their bank account stuff, you know, we'll store it so that you don't have to hold it in, you know, a spreadsheet or you don't have to go back and forth with them and delay the actual time it takes you to get paid because you have to ask them for account routing, whatever, and you'll send them an invoice for interpreting solutions of whatever amount, whether it's one time. If you have like a recurring basis where, I don't know, you're running trainings for people I can imagine.
Interpreter-Andrew Campbell: I mean, no, but it's something I've been thinking about, so I'm glad.
Christian Sheerer: Cool. Yeah, yeah. So one time more recurring, you can set that up that way, it's just a little bit different. But we'll do the one time for now. You'll set the date when it gets sent out to them. Like here's what that invoice is for. And then you can also just toggle the due date to be on the same day or in 30 days into the future. Yeah, yeah, go ahead.
Interpreter-Andrew Campbell: When it comes to the due date, is there any option just to set it for 30 days out? Like is there just a way to just one click that?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah.
Interpreter-Andrew Campbell: Maybe.
Christian Sheerer: You mean like always on the.
Interpreter-Andrew Campbell: Yeah, like automated. So if I put 9 23, the default is 10 23.
Christian Sheerer: Not currently, but I think that's something like that's, that's well taken, honestly feedback. But no, it would just be on the per invoice basis. Yeah. And then also, I mean you can have sort of a conversation with your customers. Like if you forget one time, it's not like the invoice is going to delete itself past the due date. It'll just come in as overdue. So if you forget one time to like set it up to be the 30 days in the future, they will still have that invoice link live. So like what it does is and you can upload a document that you know is the invoice or proof of work, whatever upload you want to put. And so this link gets created for that one invoice. So you know, we avoid, you know, commingling of funds where some processors batch process and they just say here's all the money that Andrew received on today. And then they try to retroactively tie it to a particular invoice and that creates some issues. We just have one link, one invoice and I'll send it out. So I sent this to my customer Christian as Degr Distribution, which is my fake company that I have for, for nickel to show people and I can send it via phone or you know, email and I'll send the link and one sec, I'll pull it up, what that looks like for the customer.
Interpreter-Andrew Campbell: And.
Christian Sheerer: I'll see this payment Request on or the customer will see it. So now I'm not Andrew anymore. I'm Andrew's customer. And I get this link and I open it up and I can just pay however I want.
Interpreter-Andrew Campbell: Okay. I like that where they see the extra fee for using a card because right now I have to do it the opposite. I tell them it'll be an extra fee, then I add that to my invoice and a little bit more, because by time I do that processing fee, since it's on a percentage, I end up losing even more money. So, yeah, I like this.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, exactly. And the reason it's set up to automatically move to the customer, you can absorb it if you want, but it's set to automatically. They pay the 2.99% if they're paying with a card. And you can split it if you want. You could do 70, 30 if you want, whatever. But yeah, this is the most. Let's not think about it. If they want to pay by card. Here you go. We find that it's like pretty easy that they will pay the way that they want to if they have all the options presented to them. Yeah, exactly. And so you don't have to add it as an invoice. The reason we're able to do that is because, like, we're processing, processing this payment as like a service and. And so we don't trip over any wires. In terms of surcharging laws, some states you're not allowed to surcharge. Right. And add an extra line item for the amount to overcome that fee. But because we're handling the payment, we can do that for you. Cool. Yeah. And then once it's paid out, it'll get reflected back here. So in terms of like, accounting and tracking these transactions, you'll have all of them, real time assessed here, completed when it gets cleared. It's one business day for a card, two business days for an ach. And I can go in to the receivables and download the CSV. I can go into the payables and download the CSV and see the full details about it. Purpose, the actual, you know, breakdown of how the transaction was initiated, when it was sent all these IDs. Right. Just in case, you know, anything comes up and is contested down the line or something. And the same thing for bill pay. When you're paying your vendors or your contractors, who or whoever, you can store all of those vendors and it can go into a particular vendor, create a bill for them and send one out. Or I can just have all my bills and view it this way and just make a payment or make multiple payments at once.
Interpreter-Andrew Campbell: So question. Could I use this option to make a payout from the company to myself?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, if it's a separate. Separate account.
Interpreter-Andrew Campbell: Yeah. Yeah, definitely separate account. So I have a business account and then I pay myself, obviously, but through the business.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah.
Interpreter-Andrew Campbell: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: I mean, I'll just say we. We don't do withholding. Like, we're. We're, you know.
Interpreter-Andrew Campbell: No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah. It. It's just that part of my business stays the same as it always has been. I'm responsible for the estimated tax and all that stuff.
Christian Sheerer: Cool. Yeah, I just like to make that clear because some people use us for, like, contractor payroll, but we're not really designed as, like, a tool. So just. Yeah, just to set expectations there.
Interpreter-Andrew Campbell: Because it would be the same thing with my subcontractors. I would just pay them. If I get to a certain amount, I give them a 1099 and we're done. But I'm covering any of their taxes.
Christian Sheerer: And we deal with a lot of, like, building contractors. Right. So, like, you know, by the end of the year, have 1099 available in nickel to make that's one step a little bit easier for you as well. But. But yeah, I just like to set expectations, like, you know, just so. Just so people don't come back and ask, like, hey, why aren't you withholding on this? You know, but, yeah, simple as that.
Interpreter-Andrew Campbell: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: And there's a couple of other, like, you know, fancier things, but I think we've. That is, like. It's funny. I worked at a software company before. This is what I do for a living, is try to help people use software. And I was at another place where it's like, you know, it's different function. It was payroll. It was a whole other thing. And I would have to. You know, we spend, like, a lot of time going through the platform because it was dense. And there's other bells and whistles that we can talk about. If you had, you know, approvals that you wanted to make, but it doesn't seem like, you know, we're at that stage yet. And so we really have gone through, I think, a majority of the workflows, unless there's one that you. Is percolating in your head that you have questions about.
Interpreter-Andrew Campbell: So I noticed you referred to, when I ask for a payment as an invoice. So does this program allow you to send estimates just kind of like you were saying about, with approvals like, is that what you're talking about for approvals or something?
Christian Sheerer: Oh, no, I'm talking about approvals in terms of like, if you had, maybe you had an assistant or like an accountant who's helping you and you wanted them to go into the platform, but you don't want them to be able to actually approve sending money out.
Interpreter-Andrew Campbell: Oh, okay, gotcha.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, that's what I mean by approval. So, yeah, the reason I got into that is because, like, some businesses who are using us and they have like an AP or an AR team using Nickel and they, the AR team or AP team is like able to set up things, but they're not able to actually authorize money going out. That's where an approval workflow would happen.
Interpreter-Andrew Campbell: And then. Does this software have any types of API or any other interface with invoicing programs?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, QuickBooks is the, is the one that we API directly into. Yeah, I mean, I, I honestly not because they pay me or anything, but just because I just know 90. That's not a direct stat. That's proved in my head, but it's like, that's the one. That's why they're the biggest company that are the best ERP, QuickBooks Online for small businesses. That's the one that we API into because it's like super fruitful for us. That was like the first one that we built. We'll probably build out more, but they'll probably be other versions of QuickBooks too. That's the best one that like, you know, creates invoices, it syncs up into Nickel directly. You can send them out and then it'll, you know, get reconciled and reconcile itself within QuickBooks as well. Um, yeah, we don't API integrate into Waze. I actually haven't heard of Waze except for the driving app. So I was like a little bit confused.
Interpreter-Andrew Campbell: But no, Wave. Not Wave.
Christian Sheerer: Wave. Wave. Wa. Oh, okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah, they're new. Oh, yeah. Okay. I ran into them a little bit at my previous company, but no. Okay. Yeah, no, we don't API into them, but that quick download upload of the CSV can accomplish the same goals. Yeah. Cool. Yeah. Anything else that you think would help you feel more comfortable?
Interpreter-Andrew Campbell: So what. Just one last question. So from what you've described, what of that is available in the free version? And then what would be the upgrades to the. That lowest tier of paid. I can't remember what I read.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, I got you. So on free versus Nickel plus, and I'll just say vast majority of people end up just Signing up for nickel plus anyway is three business day turnaround on ACH for free, two business day on ACH for plus, two business day turnaround on card payments and next business day free. So two business day for free on card payments next business day for Plus. And the main reason is 25. The main reason people go up to plus is because they have a, in a transaction that's above 25,000 per. So that, that's the limit on, on Core. And then also you can have unlimited users, meaning like unlimited amounts of people in your company who are like members or you know, you know, interacting with the system. There's only three allowed on Core and you can't do recurring payments in Core as well.
Interpreter-Andrew Campbell: You can or you cannot?
Christian Sheerer: You cannot. So yeah, that's the, that's another difference that's, I think so I guess the ones that would be most relevant to you unless you're doing, you know, a transaction above $25,000 is the turnaround times on ACH and card as well as like scheduling recurring payment.
Interpreter-Andrew Campbell: Oh, aside from that, I, that answers all my basic questions. And then from what you recall, is there any different levels to QuickBooks Online or just that's what they have and you can use as much or as little as you want?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, more of the latter. There are different levels of QuickBooks. Like there's QuickBooks Desktop, which is called QuickBooks Enterprise Now. Too expensive. And it's like you pretty much need somebody who's like dedicated to building that stuff out. I wouldn't, I wouldn't go. And they don't even really try to sell it anymore at QuickBooks because it's not, they're transitioning. Pretty much everybody trying to get them to use online. It's, it's better for them, better for the customer, whatever. Yeah, the only thing there is like once you, when you get that set up, they're going to try to get you to use their payments tool, right. Which will charge you like 1% on ACH, plus like a couple cents or dollars on each one. And so we're replacing that tool, not the ERP, right. So like you just have the ERP, you're creating invoices through QuickBooks Online, and then you just come nickel to send out those payment links so that they can get paid out and you avoid that 1% fee on the ACH and stuff like that. But some people, you know, get confused because they're like, oh, there's a payment link in QuickBooks, like, let me just use that. And, and it's Just less advantageous for them.
Interpreter-Andrew Campbell: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: But I'm pretty sure it's like 15 bucks a month. QuickBooks Online.
Interpreter-Andrew Campbell: Yeah, I've been thinking about, like I said, as time has gone by, I'm not as happy with wave as I was in the past. And although my accountant, for whatever reason, doesn't really like QuickBooks, which I think she doesn't like, that whole integration for.
Christian Sheerer: Accountants, I don't think anybody likes, like, any of their payments really. Like, like, it's just, you know. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Like, it's the best one. And I, I mean, I had a conversation 15 minutes yesterday that was just like a full complaints about QuickBooks. And I'm like, I hear you, but, like, what else are you gonna do? It's sort of like nobody likes their bank, right? Like, nobody. You know, like, we actually, I mean, we have pretty good reviews. Like, everybody's rated us five star on all the review sites, but, like, you know, still, right? It's, it's, it's. Nobody likes to work. Right. Yeah, yeah.
Interpreter-Andrew Campbell: No, that's all I got for you, Kristen. Thank you.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, cool. And so, yeah, the game plan that I typically run through is I'll send you a recap. I have a couple calls right after this, but after I get off those, I just corral all the notes that I've had with those people and I'll recap this up for you. Give us an email thread that we can kind of go back and forth on. If any questions come up as you get set up, it's just get nickel.com set up as a business, right? And put in your details. You can start to run transit. You could honestly, again, at the previous place that I was talking about where I, you know, help people get set up on software is like, I would tell them, hey, you need four weeks to get ready with nickel. You could do it in like an hour and a half, really. And today you could start sending out invoices or bill payment transactions if you wanted to. It's like, that's real, no joke. And, and so then after that, I offer some time to check in after those first run of transactions gets made so we can troubleshoot anything. Not to say that the, you know, software is going to crap out. It's just more like, hey, I know we talked about this one particular workflow when we first met, but I just need a refresher on this and I now I want to do a recurring payment. Can you walk me through that? And then pretty much after that, everybody's like, smooth, Gravy train is running and, and, and then you'll be fully good to go. So happy to do that. If you have some transactions that you're planning on running this week or the next, I'm happy to set aside some time for us maybe like 15 minutes to do that. But also that, I mean, that's no pressure. I think it's like yours, frankly, is like, is like a very simple use case and if you don't rely on me, then I have.
Interpreter-Andrew Campbell: Yeah, I was going to say things pretty straightforward. I kind of like what you mentioned about if I run into a snag to try and set something up through email.
Christian Sheerer: Cool, yeah, let's do that.
Interpreter-Andrew Campbell: Because my, you know, case and how much I'm going to be doing per week is fairly small because like I said, most of the agencies, they want to use their own system. So as I grow the business, then I think I'll get more use out of this and then again would think more about upgrading the plan and work from there.
Christian Sheerer: Awesome. Yeah, and you can do that directly in the app too. And support is always available too. So if you have a tech question, if you asked me, I'd probably. And you can still. But I'd probably still direct you to support. So like, you know, just know that that's a resource in your back pocket. We have a good help center too that'll walk you through a lot of stuff that you can peruse as those come up. And so, yeah, so let's do that. I'll give you kind of full breakdown over email. We'll have that thread open and yeah, if anything comes up, hit my line. And if not. Yeah, I think you should be good to go.
Interpreter-Andrew Campbell: Yep, perfect.
Christian Sheerer: Awesome.
Interpreter-Andrew Campbell: Nice to meet you.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, it was wonderful to meet you. Yeah, you have a good one. And yeah, always available. So let me know whenever.
Interpreter-Andrew Campbell: Okay, that's good. Thank you.
Christian Sheerer: Cool. Thank you. Have a good one.
Interpreter-Andrew Campbell: Bye.
