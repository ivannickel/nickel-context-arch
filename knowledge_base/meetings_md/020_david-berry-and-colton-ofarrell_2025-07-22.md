Colton O'Farrell: Doing really well here. Can't complain. Just getting set up. It looks like I'm all good. Awesome. Well, David, really appreciate you making some time today to hop on this call. Generally just want to give you a quick overview of typically how these go. So just want to learn more about you, Camino Engineering, what got you to find Nickel and what got you to hop on this call. Once I understand a little bit more about your business, what you're looking for in a solution, I'm happy to show you the platform, tailor it to your use cases, Then we'll wrap up with discussing which plan is a good fit for you and those next steps. But how does that sound?
David Berry: No, I think that is great. I'm just logging back into Nickel here real quick so I have it up. So we are a brand new business. We LLC'd in March, but really just started getting up and running about a week ago.
Colton O'Farrell: Congratulations.
David Berry: Thank you. Yeah, I'm excited for it. So right now we're small mom and pop. We got our first invoice. It was only for about a thousand, 1300. So we have right now a handful of small invoices that we're expecting coming in for about 50,000. we're working on some big contracts down the road, hopefully in September, one of them that we're looking at, if we can snag it's about 2 million.
Colton O'Farrell: Wow, that's awesome.
David Berry: Yeah, so right now we're just getting our feet wet with some other industries that we know we're business to business as we're trying to land some of the bigger ones. So as I'm setting a lot of this stuff up to answer one of your other questions, we, I went through QuickBooks. I have Wells Fargo. I was looking at platforms and Wells Fargo seemed a bit expensive for what they were doing. I had originally planned on going through QuickBooks. I felt their credit card rates weren't too bad. The ACH 1% I wasn't thrilled with, I didn't think, you know, 1% and I saw before historically they topped out at like 15, 20 bucks. And so that's what I had planned on doing. And then I started reading the terms as I was preparing my first invoice and saw that the 1% is no longer capped. Yeah.
Colton O'Farrell: There's all kinds of different agreements and setups that I've noticed. So some have caps, some do not, some are 1%, some are two, like it's just Kind of all over the place, but definitely not what you're looking to pay for just to get money into your bank account.
David Berry: Right, exactly. So I figured, you know, if I end up getting a two, $3 million contract, I don't want to pay $30,000 for the privilege of collecting my money.
Colton O'Farrell: Exactly.
David Berry: So I started Googling, went through some Reddit posts, went on a couple different sites. I checked out Zoho, Stripe, Bill.com, none of them really seemed much better than the other. And then I came across a Reddit post where somebody strongly recommended you guys. So then I did, some review searches for you went through, read your terms and services and figured this is exactly what I need and need now. So I signed up for the zero dollar one as I'm experimenting getting that first invoice out because again, it's, $30,000. Once we start seeing some of the bigger orders come in, then I planned on upgrading to the subscription basically. Because I'm hoping to get invoices larger than $25,000.
Colton O'Farrell: Right, exactly. Well, no, you're really way ahead of the curve. I saw you created your account yesterday. You linked your payment method. So your account's good to go. You just need to start sending or receiving those Invoices, it sounds like you're mostly going to be using us for accounts receivable.
David Berry: Yes, I figured I would also set up bill pay at least for my the landlord for our lease. Yeah, that seems like a good way to de-utilize that. Most of my other stuff have, you know, ways to set up automatic billing, but for him it's, I need to send him an ACH and this seems like a better way to do it than trying to go through my bank. So I do plan on doing that. I had one kind of major question once we get to that point on what I've done so far. Yeah.
Colton O'Farrell: I mean, if you want to go ahead and ask it, I mean, I think you're well ahead of the kind of curve here. We got plenty of time. So, okay.
David Berry: So, I set up the QuickBooks and I didn't want to use their invoicing because I didn't want to get paid all those fees. I linked QuickBooks, I see the little QB, I created my invoice, I have it shown as sent on 721-25, but then when I go into my QuickBooks, it shows that it was drafted but not sent. How do I verify that it's been sent and received?
Colton O'Farrell: So you did connect your QuickBooks account with Nickel?
David Berry: Yes.
Colton O'Farrell: So you saw all your customers, your accounts receivable, everything flew in there correctly?
David Berry: Yes.
Colton O'Farrell: So I'm going to go ahead, just share my screen quick just for this. So you would likely see something here that just says like your QuickBooks account. Do you also see this automatic payment link that's right underneath?
David Berry: No, let me see. Let me go back into QuickBooks. So is that through Nickel that you're using?
Colton O'Farrell: Yes, this would be, so this is what it would look like. I don't actually have it in my demo account to show, so that's why I have a screenshot. But like in account settings here, you'd go to integrations. And once you link your QuickBooks account, you should see that option that shows up right below it there where there's a toggable field to automatically send a Nickel payment link when an invoice is created
David Berry: from QuickBooks. Okay, so that is not toggled right now. So go ahead and toggle that.
Colton O'Farrell: So yeah, and I'll explain that just because for some businesses it makes sense, for others it does not. So what this will do is this really ensures that you don't even have to come into Nickel to send payments. If that is toggled on, what that's going to do is anytime an invoice is generated in QuickBooks Online, it's going to be automatically sent to your customer. Where it's not good to have that toggled on, is if once you generate an invoice, you have to go in, make revisions, make modifications, or mess with that invoice, because each time you would do that, your customer would get an email. But if you are just creating it, it's a one and done, ready to send, that automation, I would highly recommend turning it on. And then you would just, it would be sent automatically. You would come in here to your transactions. You'd be able to see everything that's been sent from a receivables payable side. You can also see the status on an individual invoice level here. And it would tell you when it was sent via Nickel.
David Berry: Can I share my screen? Yeah, I just wanna make sure that this sent, let me, yeah, please do. Let me share my screen. But when I go into like transactions, there's nothing here.
Colton O'Farrell: Okay, can you go to Get Paid? Yes. So yes, we can see that that invoice was sent yesterday on 721. So the reason it's not in your transactions is it hasn't been completed yet. It was sent to your customer. So if you click on that invoice, let's see.
David Berry: Yep.
Colton O'Farrell: So you got your QuickBooks file, everything attached properly. Yeah, it was sent if you exit out of that, pull out of it. Yeah, you can see just far right side that it was sent on 721. if you need to send a reminder, you can also hit that infinity arrow symbol and that would send a reminder to your customer. But from what I can see here, it looks like it was sent properly.
David Berry: Okay. So for, is this still sharing? Can you see my QuickBooks now?
Colton O'Farrell: Yep.
David Berry: Okay. So let me see, because I'm still new to QuickBooks too, so I'm still kind of, Let me go dashboard. So maybe this has changed, but when?
Colton O'Farrell: Dan, it should be a real-time sync because we do have a native integration with QuickBooks Online. Our engineering team has quite a lot of control on the fields and things that are sunk back and forth. We generally see that. So let's see opened.
David Berry: It doesn't highlight the scent or viewed. That's why I just wanted to make sure I was doing what I was doing right.
Colton O'Farrell: Can you go back to Nickel for a moment and go to your account settings?
David Berry: Yes.
Colton O'Farrell: Integrations. Yep. That's good. Then can you go to your get paid section? Sorry, within the account settings. There you go. And then scroll just a little bit, Payment Methods Linked. Okay, interesting. Well, one thing I wanted to point out is if you do ever have questions or need assistance that help center within Nickel right above or right below account settings, that does go to a real person, go to our team for tickets to be created. They usually are responding immediately to those. But I will double check. I know. So I believe the main reason that it's not been completely sent is the team still has some verification that they just need to do on their end for their account. That's what I'm understanding the blocker would be because typically it would just automatically be sent. But I will connect with the team just to make sure that everything is populating correctly. Because from what I can see so far, you shouldn't have any issues. But I believe it's because it's your first transaction. the compliance and regulatory team just has to make sure that they're completing their processes for that.
David Berry: Okay. So once that gets figured out, I don't know how familiar you are with QuickBooks, but I can come in here, create invoice, and then it should link, because I keep getting this and I don't want to set up ACH credit card or PayPal through Them. So do I just keep hitting cancel every time or just uncheck these, say confirm and continue?
Colton O'Farrell: Yes. So we are the ones who's doing the payment processing. So yes, you would have those unchecked and just hit confirm and continue because Nickel is the one who's going to be sending that on your behalf.
David Berry: Okay.
Colton O'Farrell: And with the automation toggled on, anytime an invoice is created within QuickBooks, it will just automatically be sent to your customer.
David Berry: Okay, so I don't need to do like customer payment options, anything like that.
Colton O'Farrell: That's all going to be handled outside of QuickBooks here, but whatever is done within Nickel, so when your customer completes that payment, it's all going to show up within QuickBooks Online as well. So that one-to-one reconciliation.
David Berry: So there's nothing in here that I need to do to make sure that the nickel stuff is going through properly.
Colton O'Farrell: Correct, yep. Do you have within QuickBooks here something that like the integration element for nickel or is that just all outside from-.
David Berry: Yes, so because, let me, without saving, let's see. There was, maybe it's in my settings. because I did see for integration somewhere now. I don't know where I saw it because I, again, new to all of this, so I was playing around a lot with it and I saw for integration. Let me see if this. No. Oh. I did see on there that it integrated with nickel. It was the only. It had nickel, and then it had, like, my banks that I've connected. But I just wanted to make sure that I did it right.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, it looks like you've done everything right on your end. I just sent a quick.
David Berry: My integrations, nickel.
Colton O'Farrell: Awesome. Okay, and then Integrations Overview. Can you click the three dots? Oh, let's see. Okay, cool. And then you want to just hit Launch? That's going to open you up to the Nickel page.
David Berry: Yeah.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah. So it looks like you have everything set up correctly on your side. I just sent a quick note to the team of the compliance and regulatory team there just to get some insight, but they should be able to review that and get it corrected right away so that it's you won't experience this delay in the future. Like I mentioned, it's just with your first sending of invoice, the team just has to make sure they're covering their basis and specific processes.
David Berry: Okay, yeah, and I'm good with that. I just want to make sure that I have what is set up right and that the person who I sent the invoice to is getting it.
Colton O'Farrell: No, absolutely. Thank you for reaching out and trying to get confirmation on that. Also, like I said, I would highly recommend too if you do have any questions to utilize that help center tab within Nickel. It's gonna go to a real person. Our team is, we're really known for our customer support and being really on it. So they will get you quick responses and I'm also somebody that you can reach out to if you're not getting the support you need. I can help escalate anything internally.
David Berry: Okay. I guess last question. I did the invoice through Nickel. It seems pretty simple and intuitive for me. Do you guys recommend doing it through QuickBooks or doing it through Nickel? Is it one half dozen the other?
Colton O'Farrell: So we would recommend doing everything through Nickel. And the reason for that is because we're never going to charge you ACH fees. Whereas if you do it through QuickBooks, you have to pay that 1% fee. There's no real way around it. That's where Nickel is. like subbing in as the payment processor. I did want to show you two. So for, if you wanted to stop sharing for just a moment.
David Berry: Yeah. So when I create a new invoice, it's better to do a new invoice through Nickel instead of doing a new invoice in here because of that potential for that fee.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, sorry, I might have confused you. You can still create all of your invoices and QuickBooks online. You're just going to have them sent via Nickel and we'll automatically send them with that If that field is toggled below the integrations, which it is for your case, anytime you create an invoice, it's just automatically going to be sent via Nickel. If you don't have that automation turned on, that's where you'd come in a Nickel to send those off.
David Berry: Okay. So right now, I technically I can go into QuickBooks, create my invoice. When I send it, it will send it through Nickel, not through QuickBooks, so I'm not getting charged those fees.
Colton O'Farrell: Correct. Yep.
David Berry: Okay. So I, it was one of those, I guess if there was something on here, like kind of my, my two cents, if there was something because you have all this payment stuff up here that it, I'm hesitant. So if there was something that I could see that showed that it was going to go through that way, I don't know how you guys would do that, but it's just one of those, I want to make sure that I'm sending it out right. Okay, stop sharing.
Colton O'Farrell: Thanks. Cool. Well, I just wanted to show you a couple other aspects too, since newer to the Nickel platform. So wanted to let you know by default, if your customers do want to pay via credit card, obviously we give them that option to either pay via ACH or credit card. However, by default, automatically 100% of that surcharge is going to be paid for by your customer. if for whatever reason though, this is a global rule. If you wanted to adjust this to be 50/50, 25/75, or you eat the cost fully, you do have that control. So just wanted to call out that piece of it. This is a global rule. Like I said, you can go on an individual invoice and adjust that though. So for example, we'll open up this one here. If you go to settings, we have some toggable features that you can adjust. So if you didn't want any credit card payments, you could turn that off. But this bottom field here, if you select this, this will override whatever the global surcharge rule is. So it's at 100% by default, but if you wanted to split this one, this particular invoice with this customer, you would do it like so. And then another piece that a lot of our customers find helpful is no matter if you're set up with Nickel Core or Nickel Plus, we give everyone access to their own merchant payment link. So that can be found right here. Most of our customers will take this link and they'll embed it in their own website. And it kind of serves as a one stop shop for customers to make a payment or as a backup method. So your customer would just enter their amount, what the reason for, so we'll just do $1 test here. But what they'll see is they can pay by card or they can pay via ACH for free. But most, like I said, most of our customers will just take that link and they'll embed it in their own website. You can go into account settings here and adjust the banner. You can add your branded logo, name, all that information. The only thing we can't do for the embedded payment portal is we cannot do a custom URL unless you're on a Nickel Plus plan. But if you're on the paid subscription, that is also some additional customization that we can do for you. Any questions with that piece of it?
David Berry: No, not at all. For the Nickel Plus versus the Nickel Pro, like I said, right now the zero makes sense for me until I get those invoices in and then I'll upgrade. I guess one of the biggest things for me is I saw that there's no hard transaction limit for under the Plus, but then I think I saw that it's a million dollars max. Yeah.
Colton O'Farrell: So if it is larger payments like that, we can do kind of one-off basis, but generally the limit is $1 million per transaction. But again, that's not cumulative, so you could do as many of those as you would need. I understand you have some potential contracts that are like $2 million per invoice. So in that event, you either, we could discuss with the team what it would look like on sending that versus if we had to do two separate payments. That's generally how a lot of customers will meet those kind of thresholds.
David Berry: And that's something I could talk to the customer about. It's just I, most of my stuff is going to be government contracts related. So not getting paid directly from as a prime yet. So once we get to that point, I know exactly what to do, but as a sub, I know a lot of these guys want to kind of get everything out because as soon as they do, then they can invoice the government.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep.
David Berry: That's one of those. I can talk to them, see if that's a problem. So I guess my question is, as we're going along and hopefully growing, what's kind of the difference between Nickel Plus and Nickel Pro?
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, happy to explain that. So Nickel Core, I think, is a great plan for you right now until you grow and are getting some of those bigger contracts. The main kind of differences between Nickel Core and Nickel Plus are going to be the active users. So on Nickel Core, you can only have three versus on the Plus Plan, it's unlimited. The transaction limit is $25,000 per ACH transaction on Nickel Core. That's not cumulative again, so you can do 100 of those. You just cannot do one at $26,000. On the Plus Plan, we bump it up to $1,000,000. The other limitations are you cannot do scheduling payments or recurring payments in advance. on Nickel Core. That's only on Nickel Plus. So if you have recurring invoices on a weekly, monthly, quarterly, or yearly basis, you would need a Nickel Plus subscription to be sending those. The other kind of main differences are that on Nickel Core, we generally see a two to three day turnaround time for the ACH to be processed and put into your bank account. We are still required to meet the bank cutoff times of 4:00 PM Eastern Standard Time. So as long as it's done before then, it's generally a two to three day turnaround time. On Nickel Plus, we speed that up. So it's either same day to two day turnaround times, so long as you meet the cutoff date. But otherwise, it's generally you're going to have all of the same functionality you have in core, plus some additional features and limitations or removed limitations.
David Berry: Okay. What's for like the Nickel Pro? Is that something I should be thinking about long term or is that just.
Colton O'Farrell: Kind of I, it's very, we only have like two customers on Nickel core and, or sorry, on Nickel Pro and that's the, they're like doing like $150 million invoices, like very one-off kind of particular. So we have that listed there for some of like the Fortune 500 companies or for working with them, but generally most of our customers are kind of on these two plans. I actually told them we should remove that just because it can Make things a little confusing, but Generally, Nickel Plus meets the vast majority of needs even for $50 million revenue companies.
David Berry: I hope to get past that someday, but we're nowhere near that.
Colton O'Farrell: We're nowhere near starting out. But David, I had to ask you, where did you get the name from?
David Berry: Star Wars.
Colton O'Farrell: I'm a huge Star Wars fan, so I was curious. Have you seen the new Andor?
David Berry: Oh, yes. I. There is nothing I haven't seen. I am. I have read every book, every Canon book on the timeline.
Colton O'Farrell: I'm so cool.
David Berry: Big, big, big fan. But my. My partner is as well. And we're trying to think of a name. I found out that Camino was not trademarked. It's. It's.
Colton O'Farrell: Wow.
David Berry: Open source name. There's a town in Russia named Camino. It's a surname in Japan. There was an emperor named Camino in Japan. So I went on to the on the patents rights to check to see if there was anything and there was a variety of different types of Caminos that were Trademarked, but Not the word Camino itself or Camino engineering. So I'm like if I don't have to worry about the mouse coming down on me. I'm like what better name for an engineering company.
Colton O'Farrell: That's, no, it's, it's incredible. Best, best engineering name I've seen in a long time.
David Berry: So very good job.
Colton O'Farrell: I mean, I am very biased with the Star Wars, of course, but great name.
David Berry: So, yeah, no, I, I love it. And it's funny because people always ask me, where did you come up with that? And I'm like, Star Wars. And for people that know me, they're like, oh, yeah, yeah, that, that, that makes sense. So. But it's, it's not. copyrighted by Disney. So I'm like, we will take it.
Colton O'Farrell: One moment.
David Berry: But, yeah, I'm waiting for the next show. It's just. It's. It's weird not having anything to watch right now.
Colton O'Farrell: I know. I've been playing a lot of, like, Star Wars Battlefront, too.
David Berry: I'm playing Outlaws right now, and.
Colton O'Farrell: Oh, yeah.
David Berry: Yeah.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah.
David Berry: Good. I haven't started on it yet, but, yeah, for. For being an open world, it's. It's a lot of fun. It's. It's. I've been really enjoying it.
Colton O'Farrell: That's awesome. Yeah. It's definitely on my list to check out. I played, you know, what is it? Fall or. Jedi Survivor.
David Berry: Yeah, I love those. I really enjoyed both of those games. Yep.
Colton O'Farrell: Or I play Star Wars: the Old Republic too. Yeah, I'm with all the games. So, David, I'm not getting quite the answer I was looking for with the, like, looking into the account. It says that the customer hasn't paid yet, so it won't show up as a transaction on your side, but it looks like it was successfully sent and received to them. I'm gonna do some more investigation just to get you an answer on that. But like I mentioned after this first initial transaction, shouldn't run into any of these challenges in the future. I do however have another call that I have to hop to, but if you have any other questions that come up, please let me know. Otherwise, I'll send you some resources as well as like a recorded demo video too in case your co-founder wants to give that a look. But based off the conversation we've had, I think Nickel Core could completely meet your needs with where you're at now. And then as you guys grow at Communo Engineering, you can self-serve and upgrade to the Plus Plan yourself within account settings. We give all customers a 14-day free trial for that. If you decide that after the 14 days that maybe it's not what you were looking for or need, you can always revert back to the Core Plan. Otherwise, you would just roll over to either $45 monthly subscription or $35 a month on an annual subscription.
David Berry: Perfect.
Colton O'Farrell: Pleasure meeting you. Like I said, I will be kind of the main point of contact if you have any questions or concerns, but I'll get you an email before end of day today just to confirm everything that we've discussed and really looking forward to having you as a customer and saving you some money, especially when it comes to the ACH processing. No, perfect and thank you for your time.
David Berry: I really appreciate it.
Colton O'Farrell: Absolutely, David, it was a pleasure and.
David Berry: We'Ll be speaking soon, okay? Okay, sounds good. Bye bye. Bye.
