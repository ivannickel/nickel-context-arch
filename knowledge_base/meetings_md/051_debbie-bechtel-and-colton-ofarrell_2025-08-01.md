Debbie Bechtel: . Good morning.
Colton O'Farrell: Good morning, Debbie. How's it going?
Debbie Bechtel: Good, thank you.
Colton O'Farrell: Awesome. Well, so glad you could jump on today. Just introduce myself. My name is Colton. I work on the sales team here at Nickel. Obviously got your request. I saw that you were mostly looking Looks like to using Nickel for previously scheduled and authorized ACH debit and just pull from your clients accounts. I would love to learn a little bit more about Master Pay USA, what you guys have in place today, kind of how you found Nickel and any challenges you're focusing on right now. I will then show you Nickel, we'll tailor it to your specific use cases, and then we'll kind of wrap up discussing whether it's a good fit and which plan would best support your business.
Debbie Bechtel: Okay, we are, I'm looking to replace our current billing platform. We are collecting our clients billing on a monthly basis using a system called First ACH.
Colton O'Farrell: First ACH.
Debbie Bechtel: And so as part of our, you know, we're a payroll company, but we handle the ACH processing for our clients payroll through our software. We just don't do the billing through the software because it tended The fees that they charged just didn't really seem to be necessary. And so we had gone out and found First GCH, we had been using them for a number of years. I believe they've gone through an acquisition. They recently came to me and said they're sunsetting that product. It is a bit antiquated. It does what it needs to do though. So it's okay. We work around some of the state of the art 1995 stuff going on there, but it gets the job done. at a price that makes sense.
Colton O'Farrell: Debbie, just to clarify, you guys aren't operating as an ISP by chance, are you? Like an independent service vendor?
Debbie Bechtel: I'm not familiar with that term, so I don't think, explain to me what that means.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, so third party, so ISP or third party processor too, it can mean that, like, the merchant is not setting up with Nickel directly and they're using a portal. So it's if you are handling like payment processing for your clients. So would you be operating more as kind of like a CPA or more as like an ISV?
Debbie Bechtel: I would say more like a CPA, but really not specifically. We are specialized in that we do the our business, what our revenue is generated by process providing payroll processing. services. So, you know, we're kind of the equivalent to the ADP or paychecks on a very small level. However, I'm not looking to Nickel to handle the ACH processing for our clients' employees' wages. That's handled through my software. What I'm looking for is a billing solution for us to automate the collection of our fees that we charge our clients for the services that we provide.
Colton O'Farrell: Perfect. And most of them are recurring, it sounds like today.
Debbie Bechtel: They are recurring. They're relatively stable, although they do vary because we bill based on the number of employees that they pay in any given month. So, you know, there's kind of a.
Colton O'Farrell: Set fee that, you know, so they're more dynamic.
Debbie Bechtel: More dynamic. Yeah, monthly. Right, exactly. So, you know, it might, some clients are always the same. You know, we charge them, you know, $230 every month. Boom, More done. like a subscription model, but then there might be an ongoing, you know, a one off, oh, well there was a fee for a returned item or there was a fee for this or you increased and you had more people, this, their headcount was higher. So as a result, you know, it goes up incrementally. So we will go in and it could vary on any given month by a small amount. Or we have a few clients who might prepay us and so they'll pay us once a year or a larger sum of money and then, and then-.
Colton O'Farrell: You- collect whatever else. whatever else is due after that if it doesn't cover the balance.
Debbie Bechtel: Yep. So, you know, our average volume is about $18,000 a month and that represents about 60 transactions a month. So that's what we're doing in terms of volume. So the average ticket somewhere between three and $400.
Colton O'Farrell: And how were these clients paying you today? Is it mostly ACH, is it mostly credit card, a mix, checks?
Debbie Bechtel: It's 99% ACH. We have one or two that might pay by credit card because because we've had to send them an invoice and we've had too many NSF's with them, you know, for whatever reason. So we move them off of the ACH for that reason to give them control. And so, but the vast majority of them, we are doing it, we're initiating the ACH debit. So when we're collecting all of our initial setup documentation, we're getting their void check because we're using that for the payroll as well as for the billing. And we're getting their authorization to do an ongoing recurring Debit to their account. So I don't want a scenario where I have to send them an invoice and then rely on them to say, okay, it's okay to pay because I've already gotten their authorization to process.
Colton O'Farrell: Can I ask about that authorization? Is that a paper-based form? Is it something that you had set up with your previous payment processor? What does that look like?
Debbie Bechtel: We've been using that. We have a couple of things. We have a paper-based form that we collect their wet signature on that says we can use the signature for things like like generating checks and putting it on tax returns and billing, et cetera. And then we've also been supplementing that with the form that First ACH provides and just keep that on file with them in the event that we're ever asked for that documentation, which we never really have been, but we keep them on record.
Colton O'Farrell: And the reason I asked is we are able to honor previously agreed upon payment authorizations. However, we do have a compliance and regulatory team. So like the one kind of caveat is that it potentially could slow down payments just because the team has to make do their due diligence to make sure, you know, it's not like generative AI or like related to fraud. So we can migrate those over to the auto, like the payment authorization form that we have within our own company because, you know, obviously that's pre vetted that would enable for just the fastest form of payment processing. I think paper based forms with wet signatures should be okay if it's ACH, the first ACH was the platform you mentioned? I believe that should be fine, but just the one caveat there is it could potentially slow down payments a little bit. So, I mean, if we migrated them to using the Nickel payment authorization form, we could ensure that the payments are as fast as they could be. So just one cap there. What other questions do you have for me that I could answer for you?
Debbie Bechtel: So we would then, so it sounds like you could accommodate what we need where we're initiating the debit, we're not having to have the client go in. We tried to make it as easy as possible because they are having to fill out all of the other paperwork. So we try to streamline and have them do it within one process. I don't want to have to go and say, okay, now this is the process to approve payroll and this is the process to approve billing. This is the process. I'd like to make it as easy and kind of a one-stop thing. So our implementation and onboarding process, Both obviously, I want to make it as invisible and seamless for existing clients, but also for new clients when we're bringing them on board. Do they have to do something specific with Nickel or is that something that we can handle based on what we collect from them in terms of authorization?
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, if you already have an authorization, like I said, we can honor that, but I'm happy to just set you up as like a customer in our demo account here and send you what that payment authorization form will look like. so I think might be kind of the best place to start since it sounds like that's oh, and before I guess I do that, I was curious, how did you find out about Nickel? Was it just Google searching? Was it a client recommendation?
Debbie Bechtel: It was Google searching because when first ACH came, when they're at the company that acquired them or has been doing them, they, they reached out to us and said, hey, we're sunsetting this product as of the 31st of of October. And so we're going to move you on to this other product. And that other solution came at a significantly higher expense.
Colton O'Farrell: What was that? Was it like a one to two percent fee on ACH processing or was it like just a flat rate? What were they charging you for that?
Debbie Bechtel: It was a per transaction plus percent on top. So, and they, you know, basically we were playing before we were paying a flat monthly fee Plus a per transaction charge, but there was no percentage. So it was just a fat, basically a flat monthly processing fee and then a per transaction fee. So they were layering on top of that, they were increasing the transaction fee and layering a percentage on top of it. Even negotiating that down, it was still considerably more than what we're paying today. And so that prompted me to say it, you know, ACH really shouldn't have the same kind of Right. Pricing model that credit card processing does. Absolutely. So I just decided it was time to go out to market and see, you know, what the most practical thing was going to be for us moving forward.
Colton O'Farrell: You know, that makes perfect sense to me and it's a story I hear very often. So, you know, that completely checks out and thanks for sharing kind of what exists today and really how you found us. So, Debbie, what I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead and share my screen quick. So I have just logged If you into want the to Nickel just let me know if platform. you can see this okay?
Debbie Bechtel: Yes, I can. Awesome.
Colton O'Farrell: So yeah, this is the Nickel platform here. What I'm going to do is I'm going to add you as a customer on my side and I'm going to send you a payment authorization form just so you can see what it looks like and how that would work for setting it up for your clients if you're moving that over to Nickel. But what I'm going to do is just go to oh, and also are you on QuickBooks Online Cool. by chance So as just well? I'll Yes, quickly we kind are. of walk through that first and then we'll go to the payment authorization. So we have a really sweet integration with QuickBooks. You just go to account settings here, go to integrations, click this green link QuickBooks account button. That would prompt you to a pop-up window to sign into your QuickBooks account. You would sign in, select your company, chart of accounts. Once you do that, you would get, since this is a demo account, I'm not actually It connected, would list Master but I do Pay have a USA screenshot and have your QuickBooks of what that would look like. number there. We also have this ability to turn on automation for any time an invoice is generated within QuickBooks Online. Nickel can automatically send it to your customers. Where it's not good to do that is if you're going to be generating an invoice and have to make edits or modifications to that, because once you generate it, that email would be sent to your customer. If you go in and make changes, they'd get another email. invoiCes So if that you are require generating modifications or changes, we would just recommend having that turned off. You would then, if you have that turned off in this scenario, what you would do is, so you have the connection, we're going to bring in all of your customers, all of your bills on the accounts payable side, all of your invoices on the accounts receivable side. You would just, if you don't have the payment debit authorization, which I know you do for the majority of your customers, you would just come into the far right-hand side where it says payment requests. you'd click request payment, it's sent either via email or via SMS. We'd send a secure payment link they could access via email or SMS. They would be prompted to pay either via ACH with no fees for you or your customer, or they could pay via credit card if they were looking for like a 45 day float or credit card points, because we do have customers that pay that, but essentially they will have the options and you will not be responsible for any of Credit the card surcharging. So by default, 100% of that is to be paid for by your customer, if that's how they want to pay. That is a global rule that you actually have complete control over. So if you do have a specific agreement with clients where you'd split that 50/50, you would just come in here, change the global rule to be whatever percentage you'd like. Like I mentioned, you could change this to be anything you want. We have some customers who completely pay for that for their customers, but 99, I'd say the majority of them are just keeping the default as is. But what I'm going to do is I'm going to set you up as a customer here. So I'm going to go to new customer. I am going to go ahead and grab your details. I'm going to add the your name. I'm going to grab your email here. And then I'm going to go ahead and click this setup payment authorization so you can see what it would look like. So we are going to have limited permissions. So the full permissions mean there would be no limit, there would be no expiration date. You just automatically be able to pull from their account. I'm going to set it up with limited permissions for you. So we're going to have it max transactions just be a dollar and we'll have that expire. Oops.
Debbie Bechtel: Let's see.
Colton O'Farrell: I'm just going to turn crank this back a little bit. So by default, it generally will go to be about a year, but you can change this as needed. So I'm just going to have it be closer to this date here. So we don't have one just sitting out there with you, but we'll have it expire tomorrow. So I'm going to go ahead and just put a little memo in here. All right, so we're going to go ahead and send this request. If I had your information, I could enter it myself, but in this event, obviously I do not. So I'm just going to go ahead and send you that email so you can see what your customer will receive. And if you want to just let me know when you receive it, and then and I also have like a sample one too, so you won't have to share your screen or anything, but let me know when you get that. You got it.
Debbie Bechtel: Cool.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, so what you'll see there is you'll see that little memo notice that I had. You also see some frequently asked questions and answers, but if it's too long and your customers are not reading that and they click the complete authorization form, they would again, we have it on the second page here. So it's letting them know that this authorization would be for Master Pay USA to automatically pull from their account based on agreed upon like invoice criteria. Nickel is the payment processor. We're SOC 2 compliant. We protect all of their information. All of their money is moved through FDIC insured accounts. We handle all PCI compliance. So you would only have to worry about you'd only get the net amount. We'd handle all kind of Any fees if there's credit card payments, we tell them that we accept ACH with no fee, or they can use a credit or debit card for a 2.99% fee. They would simply go to get started. They would click on the transaction limit or no limit, the expiration date or no expiration date, and that they've agreed to the terms and services. Once they do that, they just say how they're going to pay that for that, whether by card with the fee or by ACH for free. And they would simply authorize that payment and you'd be able to pull from their But account that's automatically. what it would look like in your case. So that would be for just being able to auto pull from their accounts. We can also set up recurring invoices. And since you're with QuickBooks Online, we don't have to do, you don't ever have to generate any kind of invoices directly within Nickel. You are able to do that if you'd like, and you can go to recurring. The one kind of caveat here is this would be great for your customers that have more static charges because this would be so, for example, we're gonna go ahead and do create an invoice here. Just gonna grab here. I'll just send it so you can see what it looked like on your end. We'll call this. Let's go. 140 608. Let's go. 801 25. You said, like, 250 was a. was kind of like a common amount for some of these recurring customers?
Debbie Bechtel: Sure. Cool.
Colton O'Farrell: So yeah, we'll change this from one time to be recurring. We can set that up to be every month, every week, every quarter, every year. We'll do every month. And I'm just gonna send, and I will cancel this after the meeting as well, after the demo, so you don't have to worry about that. And I'll delete you as a customer in here, but just so you can see what your customers will see. Hi, Debbie. Please make the payment as soon as possible. And when we're connected with QuickBooks, we automatically bring all your attachments invoices directly into Nickel because I'm generating this myself. I just grabbed a sample invoice from the internet, but just to show you that that will automatically attach. So I'm going to go ahead and create that. We're going to send this secure payment link right here. That's going to be sent to your email, so you'll get that in I'm just a gonna go moment. ahead and just But open while it I'm up in a new sending tab so that, you can take a peek why, while you wait for that to come. But what you'll see is it will say my name, my email, like our company branded logo, the invoice number, the amount, and the options to pay for that. This is also letting them know that this is a recurring payment and you'll be charged on the same day of every month. And again, if they want to pay by card, there is that 2.99% fee. Or if they pay by their bank in ACH, just No fee there, but this is what it would look like on kind of the recurring side. And if you have that payment authorization, as long as it falls underneath the criteria of the payment transaction limit, you would just automatically be able to pull from their account.
Debbie Bechtel: Okay, so this essentially wouldn't be an invoice. It would just be a receipt for them. We would just indicate to them, we're going to debit your account on X.
Colton O'Farrell: Date for this amount. Exactly, exactly. But this is in the event just kind of walking you through what more of kind of what customers would see. you're Maybe getting them set up. you're You don't have working the payment with authorization a new client. form set up yet. This is kind of what that workflow would look like.
Debbie Bechtel: Okay. Cool.
Colton O'Farrell: Any questions with that? Does that make sense?
Debbie Bechtel: It does make sense. We don't usually do our invoicing through QuickBooks, so we may or may not start to do that. We use it for our accounting and reconciliation, but not necessarily for Booksman.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, yeah, you don't have to, you, and you can always come in here, too, for any of the invoices you send off. So if they, if they were pulled in from QuickBooks, they would have like a little QuickBooks, like symbol there. But if they're not, they're from something else or just generated within nickel. I mean, you can come in here and Mark any of them as paid if they were paid elsewhere. And you're looking, whatever is done in nickel will reflect in QuickBooks So online. there's about a Whatever one second is done in difference QuickBooks in change there.
Debbie Bechtel: Online will Okay. reflect in nickel. And it's a And native then integration. if we're doing, what is your turnaround time from when we debit the client's account until it's funded in our account?
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, let me go ahead and pop up the pricing just to kind of walk through the plans. I'm sure you've got to look at that a little bit, but just to kind of explain a little bit more of that. So really we have two main plans with Nickel. We have our Nickel Core Plan or our Nickel in our Nickel Plus Plan. Nickel Core is the completely free plan, no subscription costs. There are some limitations with it, mainly being you only can have three active users on the account. We only allow for $25,000 per ACH transaction, not cumulative, meaning you can do 100 of those, just cannot do one at $26,000. You also get access to a customer payment portal, which I'll show you after this. Some limitations, though, are that you cannot do scheduling payments in advance, recurring payments or the auto debit. Those are only features that are available in Plus. On the free plan, it's generally a two to three day turnaround time for ACH processing. As long as you get it in before the cutoff time of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time of our banking partner. On the Nickel Plus plan, you get everything I just mentioned on Nickel Core, plus some additional features. We also speed up the ACH processing, so it's generally same day to as two long day as turnaround you meet that time. deadline, you get unlimited users, there's no hard transaction limit. So you could do ACH payments up to a million dollars if you wanted to. You can schedule payments in advance, you can do recurring payments in advance, you can do the auto debit from your customers. And what the pricing looks like for that is it's either $45 monthly or it is $35 a month. There's no transaction costs, ACH is always free with us. The only way that you would pay something here is if your customers pay via credit card and you agreed to eat some of the credit card surcharge or if you're paying bills via Nickel on the accounts payable side with the credit card. Those are the only ways that you would have to pay anything with us. Something else I wanted to call out within the Nickel platform as well is we do have this referral bonus. So if you're on Nickel Plus, it's on an annual subscription, it's But if you $420 refer a year. two businesses on a nickel, so you'll have your own referral link here that would pay for nickel plus for an entire year plus give you 80 bucks in addition to your pocket. So the demo account I have right now, this is more for just like a business owner. I do have like just an accountant view as well. If you will have clients that you'd be managing through nickel, but essentially what you do is you would have this additional tab here that says client. You could invite any of your clients right here. You would just enter their name. business EIN address and you can manage and have viewer access to your clients via Nickel. So that's more on kind of like the accountant view if you were registering.
Debbie Bechtel: That's more if we were doing bookkeeping or we were doing accounts payable and receivable for our clients, correct?
Colton O'Farrell: I'm sorry?
Debbie Bechtel: That would be more if we're providing accounts payable and/or receivable services.
Colton O'Farrell: Exactly, exactly, yep. So yeah, so that was the pricing plans kind of option. You do have the ability to upgrade at any point within, It's to self-serve essentially. You just come into account settings, come to plans. We give all customers a 14-day free trial of Plus. If you decide it's more than you need and Nickel Core meets your needs, you're always able to revert back to the free plan. You also can completely customize the, you know, your company, your background, your logo. It will be on all of the invoices, all of the payment receipts. The thing I was going to show you lastly was the payment portal. So this is a banner for what will appear in the payment portal that can be found right here on the get paid accounts receivable side. So this payment portal here, typically our customers will take this and embed it in their website. So this is for all of our customers, even on the Nickel Core plan. A lot of time, but if you are on Nickel Plus, we can also make this a custom URL and domain. Besides that, any customer can customize this however they'd like. A lot of our customers use this as kind of a one-stop shop for a customer to make a payment or as a backup method if the primary method is not working. But anyone could come in here, they could make a payment either via card or via ACH with their bank. So some people find this helpful, some don't use it. It's just up to you if this is something that would be useful for your business.
Debbie Bechtel: Okay.
Colton O'Farrell: And regarding our security and data protection information, because I know that's top of mind for a lot of customers and clients that I speak with. I've kind of said some of this information before, but just to repeat, so your funds are always yours, always. We are simply the processor. We're always moving money through FDIC insured accounts. Nickel is the one who's on the front line, so we're moving money from our own account. So it is very, very unlikely that a customer of ours would be hit by fraud before like Nickel, because Nickel is on the front lines. We're moving money from Mark from your customer's account to ours, our account to yours, just so we can speed up the payment processing. We are PCI compliant in all 50 states and with credit card surcharging, we are SOC 2 compliant. We protect all your information with encryption and tokenization. And that's what you'll notice with that secure payment link. I have over 10,000 customers using us today on accounts receivable, accounts payable, or doing both with us. But just to let you know, your information will always be protected. If you stopped working with us, you can delete your account, you can delete all of your information. We do not retain any of that on file. Any questions with that?
Debbie Bechtel: Not with that specifically. I think one question that came up is in the event that we you do, I mentioned to you we've got a handful of clients, one in particular, I'm thinking of right now that we are doing ACH for because we've had NSF issues with them. What kind of fees are associated when there is an NSF or the account was blocked or something like that? We've had various returns that happen periodically. So what are your return fees and how are those handled?
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, I'm happy to get more information on that. I'll let you know, like typically we do not have much of a problem with that. If it's something pretty sporadically, you'll be notified in the transactions tab from a receivable, payables, refunds, returns and chargebacks aspect. If it was something that was like a reoccurring problem, Nickel most likely just would not work with that customer or allow them to use the product that they're just consistently failing that and, you know, having chargebacks. So I'll get more information on that just because it's not a problem I run into too often. But I will get more specific information from the team on what that looks like.
Debbie Bechtel: Okay. And so if, you know, I was going in there and playing with it, how would I, you know, once I get the account set up, how would we set up our new accounts and kind of begin migrating them so that we could begin collecting the fees through Nickel as opposed to through our current platform?
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, so all you need to do, Debbie, is create your account, Then you come into your settings and you simply need to link a payment method. Once you've done that, you are good to start sending and receiving payments via Nickel. You can come into the integrations to bring everything in that's in QuickBooks Online. They'll bring in all your customers, all your invoices, everything. Also, if you have information in other systems or First ACH, you are able to download that as a CSV. You can get that sent to our team. They'll get it all uploaded for you. Some of our customers will do, they kind of like have a two soft different approaches. rollout They'll and start either testing do it with a few of their clients, kind of get their thoughts on what they think. Others are just like, you know, I love what I see. I'm ready to rock and roll. Let's do the integration, bring everything over and just start using Nickel. It's really up to you on how you would best like to use Nickel. I'm here to educate you and support you on what would be best for your business. Something else to just call out is we are really well known for our support and actually being able to talk to a human. So we also have, I mean, you can of course contact me and you have my email and contact information, but we also have the help center and live support right in here. So you can send a message to our team. This will get a ticket created, sent to the correct team. We're generally seeing response times of 30 minutes to an hour, unlike the later end of getting responses for same day processing. It's generally about four days, sorry, For same day processing, it's about four hours to get that into your account for the processing. So once it's made to being received, especially on credit card side, we can process those extremely fast. But any questions with that information, I know we're running up here on time and I will unfortunately get kicked from this meeting shortly. But I just want to make sure you have all your questions answered and you feel confident in using Nickel and that it can support your business.
Debbie Bechtel: I think that I just kind of want to walk through, maybe it'll be easier for me to just work with the account that I've set up.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah.
Debbie Bechtel: I just gonna walk through, you know, if I'm setting up a new client, you know, what is that gonna look like? Am I gonna be able to do that and set up their billing, you know, so that it's running smoothly?
Colton O'Farrell: Let me just show that quick. So you just come in, you would have this clients tab right here. You just go to new client, you'd add their name. the EIN, their company address, owner, once that's complete, it's going to make me fill this in, otherwise I can't complete, but you just fill in the owner information.
Debbie Bechtel: And then I have their account information, so can I set up all their bank account information, schedule their invoices?
Colton O'Farrell: Yep, of course. So this is exactly that. So I just went to my, so I went from my client account to go to the actual account, and then you would have access to the information in here. Like I mentioned, this one is just like a new accounting field that I sent up. So there's nothing really in here. But this is, you would have access in the viewer like ownership there.
Debbie Bechtel: Okay. Looks good. I will get in there and play with it and see if it'll work for us. And I guess the trial period will give me an opportunity to test it out and see. It sounds like the plus is the one that'll work for us because it allows us to do this.
Colton O'Farrell: Exactly. Exactly. and the one thing I would call out is sometimes there can be just a slight delay with that first payment because we do of course, like because of federal know your customer laws, anti-money laundering regulations, and like the Bank Secrecy Act, we do have to do some due diligence and compliance regulatory work. But so I want to take, if there is any kind of delay with any kind of first payment, it is simply usually just that first payment. So we get all the information we need. And then the timelines that I had shared previously with you would be most what to expect in the future.
Debbie Bechtel: Okay. And one thing we didn't really touch on is reporting. I would imagine there are some reports I can pull where I can get a report of all the transactions that have happened for a certain client or all the transactions that have happened within a certain date range or something. Yep.
Colton O'Farrell: And you can download all of that as like a you can download all of that as well. and CSVs of any of your clients of their transactions reports as well. What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna send you an email with some resources. So I have like a six, seven minute demo video kind of walking through most of the workflows we covered. If you wanna send that to Emily or anyone else at the team, I'll send you our security page information, the pricing page, and then also our link on G2 where you can see what other customers have said about working with Nickel. If you have any other questions that come up, feel free to reach out to me or in the help center there. But you should have everything that you need to utilize Nickel to the best of what makes the most sense for your business. And if you have any questions, I'm here to just support and help as needed. Okay, sounds good.
Debbie Bechtel: Thank you for your time.
Colton O'Farrell: It was a pleasure, Debbie. Well, I owe you an email, but if anything comes up, you just let me know.
Debbie Bechtel: Sounds good.
Colton O'Farrell: All right, bye-bye.
Debbie Bechtel: Have a wonderful day and weekend.
Colton O'Farrell: You too.
Debbie Bechtel: Bye-bye. Thank you.
