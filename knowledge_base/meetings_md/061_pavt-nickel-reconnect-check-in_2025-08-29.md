Christopher Sneed: Time later today or maybe, maybe even just Tuesday of next week because today's Friday and today, you don't like to work late on a Friday. But Andrew didn't even have time to go through the other thing yet. But right now he's on a conference call that I have to rejoin in a second.
Christian Sheerer: I appreciate the, yeah, no worries. I'll let you go. I appreciate the, the heads up there. I could do later today if you want, like anytime 1 30 to 3 or. I mean, I know it's late. Yeah. Four to six. But up to you or we can do Tuesday.
Christopher Sneed: Yeah, probably. Probably Tuesday. I do have a bunch of stuff I have to do Tuesday, so I'm gonna email you later today or after. After my. After the call, I gotta jump back on after that. I'll email you and then we'll go from there.
Christian Sheerer: Is that good? Yeah. Dope.
Christopher Sneed: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. I'll just put a block on my calendar for, like, one on Tuesday. I'm free from, like, one to four.
Christopher Sneed: So if it's within that time frame, that might be best for me. Tuesday, one to four. I think that works. But again, I gotta just look at it, but awesome. Thank you, man. I appreciate it.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, no worries. Of course. Yeah, I appreciate you giving me the heads up. So. Yeah. Yeah. Enjoy. Enjoy the rest of your day in the weekend and the long weekend.
Christopher Sneed: Same to you.
Christian Sheerer: All right, boss. I'll see you.
Christopher Sneed: All right. Yep. All right.
