Shehab Shaker: Hello.
Christian Sheerer: How's it going?
Shehab Shaker: It's going well. Thank you. Hi, Chris.
Christian Sheerer: Good to hear you.
Shehab Shaker: Taking the time.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, of course.
Shehab Shaker: Just gonna wait a couple minutes until the Deacon survivors comes in. To who? To Deacon Savirus, he's one of the clergy and he's working with me on this.
Christian Sheerer: Awesome, awesome.
Shehab Shaker: The only challenge we have is that for every time someone of the church members who would like to make any changes to the ACH has to fill application, yeah, with the liability on us and we were hoping to have a solution that would enable them to log. In. And see their ACH, that recurring, adjusted. I know it's something that's not common because the way you presented on Nickels is the same like any company who would like to bill someone and he pays that through an ACH right away. But is there a way around that? I know sometimes we might have ways around that.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, I think we have a creative solution, which should be very simple. It's actually not even too much of a workaround. So I think this should be a quick answer for you in the sense that I can show you what our payments portal looks like, which we can have hosted on. Do you guys have a. Let me just go to your website, actually.
Shehab Shaker: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: Raylan Coptic shirt.
Shehab Shaker: Shouldn't try to call him.
Christian Sheerer: And so do you have another website than.org?
Shehab Shaker: That's the one we have.org.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, okay, okay. Because.
Shehab Shaker: Let me check with him.
Christian Sheerer: Oh, yeah, yeah. Take your time.
Shehab Shaker: Sure. . Okay, we can start until he comes. I just text him, try to call him, but I don't want to waste your time.
Christian Sheerer: No worries. All good. And I'll have a recording of this and. So I can send it over.
Shehab Shaker: Sure.
Christian Sheerer: I think this might be a good solution for you. So what we have as well on Nicole is a payments portal that you can just put directly on your website. And these are for collections, right?
Shehab Shaker: Yes. So basically they make recurring donations to the church. And it's good. So as you can see on the website, we have Zephyr that they usually pay through credit cards through Zephyr. But for the recurring payments, no one would like to do it with Zephyr. It's very hard to control, adjust and all the stuff. I understand.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, I see your website now. I was going to WaylandCopticChurch.org, but I see SPSM Wayland.
Shehab Shaker: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, awesome. Okay, cool. So let me show you one of our other customers who does the same thing. Actually, I'll make this just to the window. Sorry.
Shehab Shaker: Cool.
Christian Sheerer: And so we have a customer, Chicago brass, and so they do something like.
Shehab Shaker: Right.
Christian Sheerer: They sell architectural Hardware, all this stuff, and this is their main landing page, and then they have. a pay invoice link.
Shehab Shaker: Right.
Christian Sheerer: So these are for those customized payments, in your case, those customized donations.
Shehab Shaker: Yeah. Right.
Christian Sheerer: And so nickel.
Shehab Shaker: Yes.
Christian Sheerer: Hosted. So we help maintain and then it's on their site. So yours could be a, you know, SPSM or. Weyland, right? weyland.com and then I'm basically in the view of somebody who's like in the congregation, right? And I can say, okay, here you go. This is the... Donation. Right, exactly. And then I can go in and we make it very easy. You can pay by card or...
Shehab Shaker: Yes.
Christian Sheerer: Sorry.
Shehab Shaker: You would like to activate the card if the fees are reasonable. So everything in one place also.
Christian Sheerer: Exactly, and so what does reasonable mean in your definition?
Shehab Shaker: With the fees, so what's the fees charged on the card? 299. Is there like specific or special rate for especially if we are 501C not for profit?
Christian Sheerer: So there's no difference in the rate for the type of business, but you can always customize where that rate is going. So what NICOL allows you to do is, either share a portion of that 3% with the customer, in this case, congregation member, right?
Shehab Shaker: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: Donor.
Shehab Shaker: Or.
Christian Sheerer: Pass it all on to the donor or keep it all on the way.
Shehab Shaker: I think that's a good idea. Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: And so, yeah, you can set it up so that if you're in, so I'll go to I'll go to nickel actually. So this is my administrator side. So you're logged in, right? You have an account?
Shehab Shaker: Yeah, we have an account.
Christian Sheerer: Awesome. So this is what you see typically. And I can go to an account settings on get paid and I can set the overall logic for everybody by default. what the fees are. How much do you want to pass on to the buyer? You can do it 50, you can do 40, you can do 43.
Shehab Shaker: So how could we give them option to use it or not?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, and so exactly, they will always have the option. So this will come up on the donor side, switching back to the other side of the equation.
Shehab Shaker: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: This will always come up on the donor side for them to choose, hey, do I just want to pay by ACH or do I want to pay by card? But this is the most flexible way. Most customizable way. Exactly.
Shehab Shaker: Yeah. So I think that that's okay. The only thing is that how they can set up a recurring payment. So because we saw online when we went to that website, there are recurring and we put a recurring is that they're going to be built. an invoice every month and they're gonna click on the link and pay.
Christian Sheerer: So that would be the, so the recurring is going to be set and then you can end it at a certain, you can have like a certain end date. Right. So if I go to me, I'm going to charge myself, I'm going to make it recurring, end it on a year from now.
Shehab Shaker: Yes, we did that. Exactly, we initiated one, we put the bank, we did everything just as testing.
Christian Sheerer: Awesome. And so.
Shehab Shaker: You.
Christian Sheerer: Can stop occurring, sorry, recurring in the case they want to change the donation. But technically there's no obligation for them unless you have their authorization form and you're pulling it from them. Yes. You're not using that, then there's no obligation for them to pay unless.
Shehab Shaker: They.
Christian Sheerer: Pay it, they'll just get constant reminders to do it. And so if you want to customize it, you can go and edit the recurring payment. However, if they are going to customize it from month to month, week to week, I would suggest they would go through this. But they wouldn't be able to recur it through this, if that makes sense. This is sort of a one off, right? I'm basically I basically I have no, you know, business with Chicago brass, but I could go pay them money if I want to.
Shehab Shaker: Right.
Christian Sheerer: So they're not sending me an invoice. This is going to create an invoice slash like receipt. So two separate sorts of cases here. One, the recurring that is going to be predictable. And then this one is the one if they want to customize it.
Shehab Shaker: So basically all the adjustments, anything will be from our side. Correct. They sign the authorization and then based on that we put all this to be a recurring.
Christian Sheerer: Exactly.
Shehab Shaker: So going to the recurring piece. So it's going to start on the start date automatically. So they're not going to receive anything. It's just going to do the deduction from their account. every month through this duration with this amount. So they don't have to do anything.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, yeah. The only thing they have to do is give you that authorization at the beginning. Okay.
Shehab Shaker: Okay. So I think that answered our question about this. So I think it's a good tool. But what we are currently using through the bank is very similar to that. And that's where we struggle. Should we continue with the bank with a ton of problems or go to Nickels where you can communicate with someone directly if you have any problem? And so what's the cost of if we decide to move things to Nickels? What's the cost of doing that?
Christian Sheerer: What are your problems on the bank side?
Shehab Shaker: The bank side, every couple of months, the bank do an update and the recurring stops. Okay? And we need to redraft them again, put the approvals again. These are the kind of problems that we are having, especially with banks moving to more automation and automation. That's the kind of thing that's happening all the time. takes a lot of time. It had disruption on, on, and a lot of tracking. What happened? This went through. So that's the thing that we're having with the bank.
Christian Sheerer: Why do you, why do you think that is that they have to remake you update it? Is it because.
Shehab Shaker: They say that that's, that's with some updates, the recurring. like connection, it's just, it's no longer available.
Christian Sheerer: I hear you. Okay. And then you have to redo authorization.
Shehab Shaker: Yeah, I need to reinitiate it again, send for approval again, and then it's working.
Christian Sheerer: Across all your donors?
Shehab Shaker: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: How many, how many, how many donors?
Shehab Shaker: Currently who is using this ACH are like around 37.
Christian Sheerer: Okay.
Shehab Shaker: Okay. But they're increasing every month. People find that this is a very convenient way to pay donations, especially they get a letter from at the end of the year and we can track everything the right way without any problems.
Christian Sheerer: Brilliant. Okay. And then, okay, so it's dealing with the bank. Did you, you know what bank it is?
Shehab Shaker: Who you working with? Needham. Needham Bank.
Christian Sheerer: Needham?
Shehab Shaker: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: Oh, like the city and Massachusetts.
Shehab Shaker: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: Okay. Go ahead.
Shehab Shaker: We worked with two banks, but the Needham was the one for the ACH.
Christian Sheerer: I have a feeling, because bank technology sort of lags behind, especially smaller bank technology, sort of lags behind other technology. So as they try to ratchet up and move quickly, and you can imagine it, right? Like, you know, maybe the developers that they get to work for them are sometimes consultants, right? They're not tied to the bank. They are, I'm just speculating here on why general trends of their automation.
Shehab Shaker: It's happening across all the banks, like we're working with citizen as well. It's just, this is the time where everything is transforming. And with the transformation, a lot of problems across the board. Every bank has its problems. Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: And so the good, I think the good thing in terms of ameliorating those problems with nickel is that there's sort of this communication. One, the communication.
Shehab Shaker: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: Two, I think is we just have very talented developing team. So we are updating things a lot.
Shehab Shaker: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: Sometimes that you guys don't even see really. And our goal is because we are so connected to the customer is like we don't want, if we update something, we better not mess anybody's recurring payments up, right? Because we move a lot of money every month, right? So that would be a big mess, right? If the same way. And then three is like we're in between the banking infrastructure and our customers, right? We're in between, we're sitting in the middle of that so that the issues with the bank, hopefully we have to deal with, and yeah, and so- Communicate.
Shehab Shaker: With QuickBooks because we use QuickBooks there as well.
Christian Sheerer: You guys use online?
Shehab Shaker: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, brilliant. Okay, so yeah, I mean, in terms of the cost, it's really only 35. So on ACH is free, right? As you know, the credit card percentage we talked about is that 3% as 2.99%, but it can be free for you. You can pass it on to the donor. The donors are usually very happy with paying or customers are happy with paying the 3% because of the convenience that a credit card gives them. And also, you know, the benefits of a credit card. It's, I mean, not to get into a whole theological thing about credit cards.
Shehab Shaker: But.
Christian Sheerer: The Ustury allows you to get a little bit more cash flow. And so there is a good, Yeah, so they usually kind of like take that on because of the convenience aspect of it. So the ACH is free. And so to use the platform is only 35 a month for Wayland, right, as a user, as a administrator of a Nickel account. $35 a month.
Shehab Shaker: That's 35.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, on a yearly plan. And if you're paying month to month, it's 45.
Shehab Shaker: So this is the plan if it's month to month 45. exactly this is not a big problem so what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna communicate with can you send me a recording you have a recording of us right? absolutely can you send it to me I can share it with the Deacon and and and make a decision so that we can make a decision as.
Christian Sheerer: Quick as possible Yeah, when are you hoping to speak with him today? Yeah.
Shehab Shaker: But we need to evaluate because what I'm having as a service from you is managing the credit cards and ACH. With the bank, it's one piece that's so far is causing a lot of problems. So that's why we want to handle things the best way for the people as well.
Christian Sheerer: I think it'll be nice to have like a sort of, I've never been to a Coptic church, but you guys pass around a collection basket in person?
Shehab Shaker: We do that Fridays, but most people now are moving toward like digital payments. So we have now Zelle, people can donate through Zelle, they checks, ACH, credit cards. So that's why we're trying to give them options so the easiest for them they can do.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, exactly. And the good thing is like, so what I'm getting at there is on terms of ease for the customers and that's what I like to focus on for our customers, right? Because our customers are mostly businesses who have customers, right? And the way I like to frame it is if you give them the full amount of options, they're gonna pick the easiest one. They're going to pick the portal. That's like, the reason I asked about the collection basket is that payments portal is sort of just like an online collection basket, right?
Shehab Shaker: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: And so they just know, okay, every time, or that recurring payment, they're signed up, they don't have to think about it. They know they're making their relevant donation.
Shehab Shaker: Was we able to get an email every time we like, or a letter at the end of the year as a reporting, with the payments to Nicholas?
Christian Sheerer: There should be one every time that they make a payment at the end of the year. What do you mean?
Shehab Shaker: So if there's every time they, we have a recurring payment going out, they get an email that, yeah, that's enough so they can track that.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, yeah, they, they'll be able to track.
Shehab Shaker: Sometimes you want to use this with their tax filing, like what we do with Zephyr. Circlerack sends every time at the end of the year, it sends one email with all the donation, just this is the total amount you donated through Zephyr through the year with the details. So they can print that, use them, use this in their tax file.
Christian Sheerer: That is honestly a really good suggestion. And so they have, they will get an email every time. They make one, but in terms of a complete report, I think that's a really good suggestion. That's something I'll have to take back. Regardless though, I mean, this might be for the meantime, I think that we should do this. I mean, no promises on what we develop, but I think that's a good simple kind of solution. But in that- that's what I like.
Shehab Shaker: About dealing with a company like Nichols, that we have that communication. this adjustments all that was.
Christian Sheerer: Exactly. Right. And in the meantime, what you could probably do is like go into their, you know, the customers and I can see all my transactions. Exactly.
Shehab Shaker: And print this for them, which is.
Christian Sheerer: And so maybe you, yeah, maybe you download it for them, you print it out, et cetera. Yeah. But, but I, I, I, your, your suggestion is well taken. Is checks a lot of the, the donations come in through checks?
Shehab Shaker: Most, most of the donations so far is, are through checks, which we are trying to change the culture to have it as an ACH.
Christian Sheerer: I think you'll find that to be fruitful just because then- You can visit us at Circleback, Christian, Sheerer, Shehab Shaker, Christian Sheerer in the audio. and so that's something, you know, I think there are two kind of next steps for us. One is if you wanted to log in and try out, you, have you made a transaction? Have you accepted a transaction through Nicole yet?
Shehab Shaker: So we had an account. We put all information there and we tried to test one, but we didn't process one. So we tried to. But I can do that, like, for me or for him, we can. test one and see how it's going, which we wanted to do after this meeting.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, awesome.
Shehab Shaker: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: I mean, if you wanted to try it right now, it should be super quick. Or you want to wait to speak to the Deacon?
Shehab Shaker: Yeah, because he's the one. He's a. For being a Deacon, he was a computer engineer, so. Ah, nice. Link with me.
Christian Sheerer: I'm the finance guy, so he's handling with me all this stuff.
Shehab Shaker: Cool, cool, cool.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, I'm actually, I'm sitting across from. From my church in my neighborhood. I wonder if we. If I can go over there and.
Shehab Shaker: Be like, hey, By the you way, guys it's should a use big nickel.
Christian Sheerer: Market because I know, I know, I know.
Shehab Shaker: It was a little development for most of the churches now. They are looking for solutions for payments, for donations, and no one is in this market. Believe me, if Nichols could make some development like this, they will be the only company on the market.
Christian Sheerer: You know, isn't it? I mean, I hear you. You know what's interesting, sort of different is I was In a previous job of mine, I was selling software again. But I found it super interesting. There were these entire fintech platforms for that were like, the Halal fintech, right?
Shehab Shaker: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: Islam. And I was like, oh, this is interesting. That makes sense that you would have to focus on that. So this is a different version of, you know, how do we take church donations.
Shehab Shaker: And it's gonna work with any non-for-profit organization because they work as of out of donation and the non-profits are a ton.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, they're growing too. Okay, so I think, okay, that was the one first next step is try out a payment. And then two, I would say when you get with the Deacon, we can send him this video with the payments portal. And if you run into any issues setting up the payments portal, I can hop back on a call and then I'll say, let's get into check-in next week after you've had the time to set it up, run some tests, see if you have found everything to your liking. And it might be, you know, very quick check-in, like 10-15 minutes, cool, everything's smooth, or it might be, hey, the Deacon has another question, maybe thinks of a better workaround with his computer engineer brain.
Shehab Shaker: Perfect. That's good, too. Thank you, Chris, so much for your time. I appreciate it.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, what time next week works for you? Just so I have you on the calendar.
Shehab Shaker: I think same time next week would work.
Christian Sheerer: Same time? Okay, let's do it. Awesome. I will put that for 30 minutes. We might not need all 30, but if we do, we have it.
Shehab Shaker: Perfect.
Christian Sheerer: All right, Shehab.
Shehab Shaker: Thank you.
Christian Sheerer: Did I say it correct, Shehab?
Shehab Shaker: Shehab, yes.
Christian Sheerer: Shehab. Awesome. Wonderful to meet you. And yeah, I will send over recap with the stuff that we talked about. I'll highlight in bold, okay, this is like, you know, the suggested workaround of using the payments portal. And then after that, run some tests with the Deacon sync with him, and then I'll see them come in on the, on our side. And if there are any questions, let me know. And then we have a set up time for next week.
Shehab Shaker: Perfect. Thank you so much. I appreciate your time.
Christian Sheerer: No problem. Thank you. Yeah, you too.
Shehab Shaker: Take care.
Christian Sheerer: Bye.
Shehab Shaker: Bye.
