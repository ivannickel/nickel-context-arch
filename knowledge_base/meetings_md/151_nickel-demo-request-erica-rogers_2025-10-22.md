17208996069: Hello?
Jacob Greenberg: Hey, Erica, can you hear me okay?
17208996069: I can hear you now. For some reason, it was not working until I called in. Oh, good.
Jacob Greenberg: All right, well, I'm happy that, that we could connect today. So I see that you're looking for an alternative to Melio. You have clients that would like to pay their vendors, do 1099 management and get paid by customers. I have 30 minutes on the calendar for us. Does that still work for you?
17208996069: Yes.
Jacob Greenberg: Perfect. All right. Well, would you give me a little bit of background about your business and your role? I know you gave me some notes about what you're looking for, but can you walk me through what you're currently doing? And then I will customize a demo to fit your use case.
17208996069: Okay, well, I am basically an outsourced bookkeeper slash not quite accountant level most of the time. I have a couple, I do full accounting, but most of the time it's just bookkeeping through QuickBooks Online. And right now I have five clients. Three of them use Neilio. Neilio has now shut down one of their accounts. Just shut it down, stuff in process, who knows what the heck they're going to do because they're not even responding. So, I am looking for an alternative for all three of them, hopefully eventually, but at the moment we just need to get some bodies through so we can start processing payments ASAP.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, gotcha. So, you have five businesses that you work with. One of them just got booted off of Melio and you can't get in touch with them. You're using QuickBooks Online. And for the companies that you represent, do you do the accounting for accounts receivable and accounts payable for them? Do you process those invoices or you're just doing the accounting after the fact in QuickBooks?
17208996069: I do process payments. The AP fully. We use Hubdoc to get it into QuickBooks. Because I am remote, so we use Hubdoc to get it into QuickBooks and then process the payments through Melio. We just implemented AR through Melio. I don't think we've received a single payment yet, honestly. They canceled two of them, but one of them possibly came out of their customer's bank.
Jacob Greenberg: Got it. Okay, cool. Yeah, I know that Melio is going through a big transition right now. They recently got acquired by Xero. Which is a direct competitor to QuickBooks. So I know that, you know, I think that there's a big internal transition and I think that their customer service and customer experience reps have been either inundated or just not as responsive recently.
17208996069: Oh, they have never been responsive.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay.
17208996069: When it works, it's fine. When it doesn't, they're awful. Always has been when they were totally free. It was acceptable, I guess. But now that you have to pay, it really isn't.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. Okay. I think you'll find with Nickel that not only do we have a free solution, we also have really good customer response times.
17208996069: That's what I was going to ask. Do you have US-based customer support?
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, our entire employee base is based in the US. Okay. All right, so can you just tell me, you said there's five businesses, correct?
17208996069: Yes.
Jacob Greenberg: And they're all using, you do QuickBooks for all the five businesses?
17208996069: Yeah, they're all using QuickBooks online.
Jacob Greenberg: Great. And can you tell me the name of the different businesses that you will be operating with Nicole on?
17208996069: Well, feed or fabrication is the one that needs to start ASAP.
Jacob Greenberg: That's feeder fabrications.
17208996069: Feed or F-E-D-O-R. Feed or, okay. Fabrication.
Jacob Greenberg: And what is the average transaction size for feed or fabrications?
17208996069: Well, when you say transaction size, when I run AP each week, it generally runs. Let's say 20 to 60,000. It's multiple vendors, usually, say 6 to 12. The number of invoices, because I combine the payments, the number of invoices obviously varies.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha.
17208996069: Now for AR, It depends. It's it he just acquired. I was doing the bookkeeping for feed or fabrication that's old to this guy. So he's a new feed or fabrication even though it's a long-standing business. The AR is probably 100 to 150,000 a week.
Jacob Greenberg: And roughly how many transactions? And I know it's hard because you recently started covering for the new owner, but can you give me a rough estimate of how many transactions that volume is cut across on a weekly basis? Is that like one transaction a week that's worth 150,000 or is that like $151,000 transactions?
17208996069: No, it's, Most invoices, individual invoices, are probably 1,000 to 20,000. So, you're talking if you're looking at the number of invoices I pay for AP, it's probably around 20 a week. It just depends. Well, and then when you do your, you know, like Ferguson or these companies that have your terms due on the 10th, That week, obviously, you might do 20 invoices combined into one payment.
Jacob Greenberg: So, gotcha.
17208996069: Over the course of a month, it's probably 150 AP transactions, maybe 200 at most.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. Okay, great.
17208996069: And again, the payments are way less. I mean, I think, I don't think there's ever been a week with him that I've done over 15 payments in a week.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. And then the other businesses that we're going to, so federal fabrications will be the first one. That's the priority. And then for the other businesses that we set you up with, can you give me a quick rundown of what they're called, what they do?
17208996069: Well, okay, so one of them is feeder fabrication. It's the one that's sold. And that one is, I think he's going to do, and he may change the business, well, it's his business name. He can do what he wants. It is still going to be like interior remodeling cabinet type stuff. Then there is reconstruct, which is a They do egress windows. Actually reconstruct does, sorry, reconstruct does excavating Colorado egress does egress windows. But it's not they aren't the business. He is kind of a broker. He pays the subs and he receives payments from customers. Actual payments out are very, very low. It's just the 1099 vendors. So, yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: And that's for AE in the audio. Transcribe for.
17208996069: Actually, it's for both of them. He does the same thing. He, he essentially is just a construction broker. He finds the people to go do the work and he gets his cut.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. Okay, cool. And so for that, what is the average amount of a. Transactions and volume that you guys are doing on AP and AR on a monthly basis?
17208996069: AR is probably just to be on a rough 120,000 and AP is well, truly right now the subs we're paying through payroll or ADP is not through payroll but they're paying through ADP. So right now, the subs, it is really just maybe 50,000, no, not 50, 30,000 a month. It's for the things that he pays off cycle.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay. So we're looking about 120K a month for AR and 30K per month for AP for both reconstructing egress businesses individually or combined?
17208996069: Individually.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay. Gotcha.
17208996069: And then the other thing that he does, and I don't know about it on your end, but oh no, maybe that's not you. That might be bill.com. Do you have, you don't have the expense management piece, right?
Jacob Greenberg: No, we don't.
17208996069: Okay. Yeah, he pays a lot of stuff through credit cards. That's how most of the payments are made for materials and travel.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay. Yep. You could use credit card within nickel if you would like.
17208996069: Well, I mean, he does them on the spot.
Jacob Greenberg: Oh, gotcha.
17208996069: You book your plane, you pay for your gas, you pay for your. There's lots of those transactions, but, yes, not through AP.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. Okay, gotcha. We will be coming out with credit card and trade credit functionality in. January. So he might, if he starts liking Nicole, we can probably help with that too.
17208996069: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: And then so I've fed the fabrication, the reconstruct and the egress windows business. Were there any more that I should be aware of?
17208996069: No. Well, if this works, yes. I do have, there's another client that has, it's Mayfield Gardens, but they have landscaping services and like landscaping. They do maintain, they have 2 companies, but yeah, so it's all landscaping I guess based and they are actually very large. I have stepped out of the AP part. I just primarily concentrate on payroll, but they pay so much in fees to QuickBooks for their AP. So if this was successful, what?
Jacob Greenberg: They use QuickBooks, so they use it for AP and AR?
17208996069: They do. And they're AR, you should see the fees that come through for both. Because I am just primarily, I've never done AR other than once in a while I produce an invoice for them, but I've never done the collection part or anything, but you're talking huge payments coming through paying QuickBooks fees. And a lot of them are the credit card ones and they're paying three points. I think they're 2.9, I think they're 3.9, 3.5. It's high.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, well, the way we do it, pretty much every business that use Nickel doesn't pay the fees themselves whatsoever. So our claim to fame here is that we're typically saving businesses 1 to 3% of their total revenue because that's usually going to fees split between whether it's wire transfers, ACH costs or credit card costs. And I'll show you in the demo today why our invoicing is this way, but we essentially present the option to your customer to be able to pay however they like. They could pay for completely free via AE or they could pay with credit card if they choose to do so. And if they choose to pay via credit card, they typically, nickel businesses will pass that fee on to the customer. And it's completely legally compliant and all 50 states. So.
17208996069: Oh, and I think I did see that because I saw that your customer, because I was looking through all of your stuff, if your customer chooses to pay, you know, that 2.9% fee is added to what they pay.
Jacob Greenberg: Exactly. So can I ask, I know that you said Mayfield Gardens is a bit larger than the other locations. What is the amount that you're bringing in revenue in, in, in. APs?
17208996069: Oh yeah, they're huge. And by that, I mean, heaven. Funny, I looked at their financials a few times lately, but for the most part, I stay out. But you're talking it's millions for both of them. One of them is probably in the 2 to 3, that's the small one that just does the small bit. And then the other one you're talking. Yeah, millions.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha.
17208996069: They have millions of dollars of cash in their bank accounts. So you know that.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. And I guess they're doing the 1% ACH with QuickBooks.
17208996069: Yes. And I thought, and this is the thing, because I stay out of their fees and because she pays for her own QuickBooks. But I swear they're not. I thought that QuickBooks had that $20 cap.
Jacob Greenberg: No, they used to.
17208996069: Well, and I thought that they kind of grandfathered the old, but it sure doesn't look like it. And like I said, I see the fees because I see them. I do the bank stuff for them. Like I get the bank racks and I accept charges and stuff. So I see these huge fees and they could all be credit cards. But I don't see $20 coming through anymore as just a $20. So I'm pretty sure that they're paying very high ACH fees.
Jacob Greenberg: If they're doing about 6 million a year, I'd assume that, you know, the average split that we kind of experience. So for businesses that do about 5 million, we're seeing about 90,000, so 1.8% in fees. But it really depends on if the majority of their transactions are credit card or if the majority of the transactions are ACH. But that's with QuickBooks specifically. So we have a ton of people to us who use QuickBooks Online because of the integration with Nickel, but want to avoid the fees that QuickBooks has. So without further ado, I'm just going to give you a little bit of background about who we are and what we do, give you an understanding of why I kind of asked the questions that I was asking, and I'll show you a little bit of inside our platform. It's a really simple, straightforward product, so you'll get the gist of it in seconds.
17208996069: But I did manage to set up an account last night for me, for my business.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, great. And that was, what is the name of your business? AE in the audio.
17208996069: Transcribe the English words that are spoken.
Jacob Greenberg: Cool. Okay, great.
17208996069: Yep.
Jacob Greenberg: So a little bit of background on Nicole, our founder, was the director of innovation at Stanley Black and Decker. About five or six years ago. And he realized that in the built world industries and contracting and in construction, home care services, profit margins are pretty slim, typically under 6% or less. Cash flow is therefore very, very important. But these are industries that typically had pretty hard cash flow problems. A lot of payments via checks that were just kind of sitting around in trucks for a long time. Using merchant processors such as Melio that have not up-to-date and standardized modern payment rails. Melio, for example, just because you were familiar with using it, Melio is open to any type of business, including sole proprietor businesses. Because of that, their payment rails are built a little bit differently and they're not secured for handling large-scale transactions, which is why transactions that might be $25,000 or $30,000 per transaction or even like 10,000 plus might occasionally get red flags and held for a week and a half before being deposited. We also found that businesses either were in one or two boats. They accepted all types of payments, cash, credit card, check, ACH, wire transfer, etc., but had multiple different methods of collecting and reconciling those payments. And it took a lot of time, it was very time consuming, or they've only stuck to one or two types of payments. Because they wanted to avoid high fees, so they would stick to just cash or check. We wanted to create a very, very easy, straightforward solution that made it incredibly simple for customers of Nickel businesses to pay however they prefer, get the cash flow advantage of being able to use credit card, ACH, check, et cetera, without it impacting the business negatively as far as fees and costs or time to settlement. So we designed our solution on more modern payment rails, we call it an industrial strength payment. And the technology that we've kind of pioneered here enables us to be able to process larger scale transactions more securely and more affordably. So we're able to offer free AE and that's a core tenet of what we do. It's never going to change. It's who we are in our fiber. And to just service these businesses in a little bit more of a fair and honest way. Be able to process transactions of $20,000 up to $500,000 or a million dollars per individual transaction. With a one-to-one settlement so that it's not batch processed in your bank account after a large transaction goes through, and we can guarantee quick turnaround times. The transaction won't be held for a week and a half like it might be with other merchant processors, such as QuickBooks Pay or Melio. So that's kind of the origination of what we do. We see the future of our solution moving more towards like what I was mentioning before, offering trade credits, net term agreements, Anything that is focused on providing a cash flow advantage to these businesses. So I know that you logged in and played around a little bit. Were you able to create an invoice previously?
17208996069: I did not create an invoice.
Jacob Greenberg: Awesome. I'll give you a full walkthrough of pretty much all the tools in our platform. It won't take too long. If you have any questions, feel free to let me know.
17208996069: Well, okay. So before you do this, it says that it integrates with QuickBooks. So does it pull over invoices created in QuickBooks?
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, absolutely.
17208996069: So, okay, because here's the thing. What he's actually doing, and this is kind of sounds clunky, but I think it'll work. They have a construction management software that they're using that they're going to invoice from that will push it, the invoices into QuickBooks. Then we need the QuickBooks invoice to come over into our payment System.
Jacob Greenberg: Perfect. That is a bread and butter of nickel. So first thing you would do is walk into account settings here on the lower left hand side. Click on the integrations button on the far right and then link your QuickBooks account. So it's going to choose, it's going to prompt you to choose the chart of accounts that you want to select. Select the one that you're looking to connect. The first time you sync with QuickBooks, I'm just going to give you the heads up, depending on how much data you have in your QuickBooks, it might take between like three and five minutes to do the entire sync. A progress bar doesn't load to show you and it just shows you when it's done. Just to give you the heads up, but once you do it the first time, it's going to be an instantaneous two-way automatic sync between Nickel and QuickBooks. Most of the Nickel businesses that use QuickBooks online and do integrate in Nickel, actually continue to generate their invoices from within QuickBooks. Then they'll pop into Nickel. They'll go to the Get Paid section here, which is for accounts receivable. The invoices that they've created from within QuickBooks will generate here. You'll be able to identify the ones that come from QuickBooks for the business that you're referring to. All of them will come from QuickBooks, but you'll see that they'll have a QuickBooks icon next to each of the invoice numbers. Okay. So you generate it from within QuickBooks and it auto populates here. If you wanted to edit the transaction from within Nickel after you integrate QuickBooks, it will actually right here, my account isn't synced to a QuickBooks account. However, all of the data and the tools that you use within QuickBooks to generate an invoice, such as unique line items that are paired with costs and etc, That will actually all populate as its own field before this invoice detail field here. So you can use all the information that's already pre-programmed into your QuickBooks to make tweaks to the invoices if you want to after they come into Nickel and it will automatically sync to that line item invoice within QuickBooks as well.
17208996069: Okay. So then my question, sorry.
Jacob Greenberg: No, go ahead.
17208996069: So here, When it comes from QuickBooks over here, do we still separately send them from Nickel so that it has the payment link?
Jacob Greenberg: Exactly. So you'll come into here, generate all of your invoices, and you could even make it easier on yourself by just selecting all unsent invoices. And now you'll see all the invoices that haven't been sent yet. You can either manually send each individual one by clicking request payment, by clicking into it and sending it from here or doing Marcus paid or you can select all of the unpaid invoices or unsent ones and send them all at the same time.
17208996069: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: So once you sync QuickBooks, most people think of Nickel as their cash flow of their business. QuickBooks is the reconciliation source of truth for accounting. And Nickel is where all the money moves through and comes into QuickBooks from.
17208996069: Okay. And then it looked like your settlement dates were quicker. And it's funny because I saw somewhere where it was like next day and somewhere two days or something, but when a customer pays, what's the turnaround time to being deposited?
Jacob Greenberg: Yep. So it depends what platform you want to select. Nickel Core is completely free to use. It has a three-day ACH turnaround time. And a two-day credit card turnaround time. Nickel+ is $35 a month and it has one day faster turnaround times for ACH and for Card. So for Card, it will be next day turnaround and for ACH, it will be two-day turnaround.
17208996069: Okay. I think, I mean, obviously we're paying for Melio, so I think the $35 a month would be perfectly fine. And you can use unlimited users So, like the gentleman that does the invoices produces the invoices at the company, we could set him up, the owner could be set up, you know, I could have it. There wouldn't be a problem.
Jacob Greenberg: Absolutely. Yep.
17208996069: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: And a couple different options we can have for arranging this. Let me show you some features that might make sense for you. When you add a member, if you're on Nickel+, you can add as many members as you want to. And you could give them each unique permissions as well. So everybody can be an administrator if you want, which means everyone has full access to every tool in Nickel. You can assign people as managers, which gives them the ability to perform actions like transferring funds, but they can't make changes to important information like bank account or Nickel account. So they wouldn't have access to add new members or change any of the workflows that you have built up, because there's a lot of custom workflows you could do within Nickel if you want. Or you can have them as a member, which is somebody that can have restricted access to the solution, but can't take actions that can actually transfer funds. So one example of this would be if you wanted to make a bill payment and you're just a member, you can schedule that bill payment in advance, but it would get sent to a manager or an administrator to give the approval before that bill payment can actually be paid. Just as an example. And you can customize what this workflow is, who has the ability to approve it, what size of transactions require approval, stuff like that. The other thing here, and if you give me one second, I'll load a new screen. Is we have two different ways we can actually set up your account. Let's see. Sorry, one second here.
17208996069: No, you're okay. That's weird. The account I set up, it looks like I'm still logged in. It doesn't kick you out after a certain amount of time.
Jacob Greenberg: It might save your login information and you might be able to just access it again.
17208996069: Oh no, I mean, I left it open overnight and it was still there.
Jacob Greenberg: Oh, gotcha. Yeah, unless you log out, you'll be logged in.
17208996069: Okay, not that I'm kind of annoyed with it when it only gives you like 20-30 minutes, so that's kind of nice.
Jacob Greenberg: Oh yeah, and it just like will kick you out automatically after 30 minutes. Is that what you're saying?
17208996069: Yeah, but I didn't even think to not that while my bank accounts looked up in there, so yeah, because I did do that.
Jacob Greenberg: I must have updated. Well, all good. I can send you some screenshots, but essentially we have the ability to create what's called an accountant's account. Where between the summary and transaction tabs, you'll see a tab that says clients. And when you click on clients, it'll just give you the ability to create multiple other sub accounts under your master account so that you have access to all of your different client pages.
17208996069: That's how I set my account up. I do have clients in it.
Jacob Greenberg: Great. I had a feeling that that might be the case.
17208996069: Great.
Jacob Greenberg: So you could add different users to those different accounts with different permissions to be able to execute within their own accounts and not have access to all the accounts. That you have access to.
17208996069: Okay. And it does look like so, like I can do new client basic information and then does it send an invite to him?
Jacob Greenberg: Yep, it will.
17208996069: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: All right.
17208996069: Because, yes, what we've been doing is I've been paying the monthly fee. They pay the any extra fees like We have some vendors that you must send a paper check to.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. Yep, that makes sense. And you could send checks through Nickel if you wanted to.
17208996069: I saw that for $2 a check, right?
Jacob Greenberg: Exactly. Shipping fees and stuff.
17208996069: Yeah, no, that makes sense. I mean.
Jacob Greenberg: Well, so what we do here, and do you guys ever do recurring invoices or just individual invoices for accounts receivable?
17208996069: Yeah, individual. Even the deposits, even if they're on a schedule, they're not really recurring, it'd just be one or, well, maybe three. So it would be easier just to do individual.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. Once you create an invoice from within, I'm just generating one with a nickel to give you an example of what a finished one would look like, but you will be building within QuickBooks and they'll push to nickel. Once you do that, it will automatically pull over all of the invoice information, sequential invoice numbering, any of the line item information. It will actually also, you could add notes for customer if you want to. But it will actually automatically add the line item invoice PDF that's generated within QuickBooks to this document. Every time you send an invoice from Nickel, it'll already have that PDF attachment. You don't need to do it manually. Then that's pretty much it. We're just going to create this invoice. Now within Nickel, one feature that I don't believe you guys currently have is if you do already have customer banking information, Nickel enables you to do AE in the audio. Transcribe the English words that are spoken. You can debit your customer's account automatically for free with free AE. You can send the unique invoices if you want to or you could just charge their card or charge their bank right away.
17208996069: Okay, so for the landscaping company, that's one of the things they do. They save bank info and they automatically charge it. And are they monthly?
Jacob Greenberg: They're doing that bank to bank?
17208996069: Well, they know they're doing it with credit cards right now. But if they had the option to not get the credit card fee and do it bank to bank, that might be okay. So, yeah, for FEOR, this doesn't seem very helpful. But the recurring for the landscaping company that does monthly landscaping, It's the same amount all season.
Jacob Greenberg: Oh, yeah.
17208996069: So see for them, see I wasn't even thinking of, I'm or concentrating on my bigger problem. But no, this would be really helpful for them. So, well, I said if this works. If this works, this looks like something. That she would really be interested in.
Jacob Greenberg: So it seems like you have one really, really big problem and then one immediate problem. And the immediate problem we're going to make sure you take care of first and foremost, which is getting the other businesses that are needing to switch off from MLEO as soon as possible into nickel and operating smoothly. So I'll address all the things that you need so that if you have any questions, make sure to ask me about those. I'm happy to answer them now. But I think the bigger problem in terms of like financial returns and wasted money is probably on the landscaping. And yeah, so yep, automatic recurring future charges you can set up within Nickel. We could do ACH debits that you're not taking the 3.4% credit card fees every single month on every single account. I think it's going to be a really easy big win for the landscaping companies. But we could get you set up first with the other guys.
17208996069: Yeah, no, once I do that, I mean, like I said, I've kind of stepped back. I've done all of it over the years because I've been working with them for five years. But, you know, as they've gotten bigger, their payroll takes me way too many hours.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah.
17208996069: You know, it's one of those things.
Jacob Greenberg: Payroll as well. What you can do is on the bill pay side, you can set up recurring bills and track all of them. So if you want to create a recurring bill for an employee, you can do so by adding them as a vendor and putting in the amount and it'll automatically make that payment via ACH to their bank.
17208996069: Okay. Yeah. Okay. No, I okay. So I'm at past 9:30. I need to get off onto another meeting. Is there anything else? Can you send me something? Do you have a PDF that I could present to a client to show the benefits of this, or do I just need to explain it to him?
Jacob Greenberg: I'm happy to explain it. If there's any specific client, is this for the landscaping or for the first company switching off Melio?
17208996069: Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay. I'm happy to write up some pros and cons if you'd like. We have demo videos within Nickel. I'm also happy to set up a call with him to talk through it and about the time and money savings as well.
17208996069: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah. All right.
17208996069: Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: Be the most effective method. I typically just having a meeting to walk through how this would impact the business is usually the most effective way, but you know your clients best.
17208996069: Yes. Well, if you could write up, you know, just something with the pros and cons, and if there's any flyers or anything, send that to me. I'm going to give them a call here in the next last hour or so. So if you don't have it yet, it's fine. Okay. And then, yeah, I I'll let you know, but I'm. I'm pretty sure that this is the way to go.
Jacob Greenberg: Awesome. All right, cool. And there's some other tips and tricks and Easter eggs I'd love to show you at another point. So I think if it's all right with you, what with this Melio situation, is there, like, a timeline for switching over that I need to be aware of, or is it just as soon as possible?
17208996069: Oh, it's I need to get some payments out this week.
Jacob Greenberg: So, it's got to be.
17208996069: Also, the problem is how do you request banking info? Do we have to get it ourselves or can I send requests out of here?
Jacob Greenberg: Yep. Here, let me show you. And I have a little bit more time. So, if you need to hop off, go for it, but I'll show you really quickly. So, for any one of these invoices.
17208996069: If.
Jacob Greenberg: You go to charge payment method on file, and you could do this from the invoice section under get paid or from the customer section under get paid as well. So you could go to the customer and make this request. But so this invoice that we just created for Carcraft, we can go here to get paid, charge payment method on file, add payment information. Oh, this is if I already have the info, sorry. So, so go to the customer and go to add payment method. You can enter it manually by adding a card or a bank account or you could request it from the customer here. Any notes to this customer can go. And you send this request. When you send this request, Give me one second. It'll have your company name, it'll say payment authorization request. They go ahead and click into this. It's a quick overview of what NIKEL is and accepting the terms and conditions, which they can read more by clicking that link and then just entering the info. We connect with Plaid, so it's easy for them to just log into the bank instead of having to find and enter all the bank information. And we'll store the information with PCI and SOC 2 compliance on your behalf so that you guys don't have to be liable for any of that information being stored properly.
17208996069: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: Just the thing is, before you send this out, go ahead and go into Nickel, Account Settings, and update your logo and your banner for the companies that are going to be sending out that request so that the email is branded when it's received.
17208996069: Okay. And then the same thing works for vendors. You can do the same thing to pay them.
Jacob Greenberg: Exactly. So if you have any questions as you go through it, you can feel free to reach out. I'm happy to help you out. And if you guys do enroll in Nickel Plus, I'll set you up with a customer success manager so that you have access to on-demand trainings and support.
17208996069: Okay. So then I guess my next question is I have your email. Once I talk to him because.
Jacob Greenberg: I.
17208996069: Really, yeah, at this point we need to get stuff out this week somehow. I mean, our subs get really picky if they don't have it. So I'm, if I can talk him into it, I may be doing it as soon as today getting everything set up. You can start processing payments. What would I need to do to let you know?
Jacob Greenberg: Well, You know what? I'm just going to see. Okay, great. If you need, I can make an introduction to you and a customer success manager today so that he can be available to support you through your first couple transactions if you want him to be. Otherwise, just let me know that when you intend to send out those transactions, I'll let my team know that you're intending to send out those transactions so that we can get you moving through the pipeline as quick as possible.
17208996069: Okay, go ahead and set it up with him. I can. I mean, because, well, obviously, I can't talk for him without. But, yeah, I think. I think we might go this way.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha.
17208996069: Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: So I'll send a recap today with some information that you can share with your team or your different business owners. I will set up a meeting introduction with you and Colton so that he can support you through your first couple transactions today or tomorrow. Would you prefer for that to be today or tomorrow?
17208996069: To talk with him today would be great.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. The best use case for meeting with him would be to be able to do some demos and to process your first couple transactions with supervision for support.
17208996069: Okay. Yeah. Well, I mean, I don't know that I need that, but yes, we can.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, great. I'll just connect you for an introduction then. And what I'd like to do is if I could find some time to just put on the calendar to pivot around to do a reconnect. Reminder for next week with you just to make sure that everything's going smoothly and we could talk about how everything's going and see if you need any more support. I'm happy to do that.
17208996069: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: Can I throw something on the calendar for same time next week? Next Wednesday? Sure.
17208996069: That should be good.
Jacob Greenberg: Perfect. Give me two seconds here. I'll send that out.
17208996069: All right.
Jacob Greenberg: Great. So I'll speak to you on the call next Wednesday at 10:00 Eastern. And I will connect you today and do a follow up to our call today that you could share with some resources to some of your clients.
17208996069: Okay, I got your email. Let's see, 429.
Jacob Greenberg: And then would, are you on the East Coast, Erica, or what time zone are you in?
17208996069: No, I'm in Central.
Jacob Greenberg: You're in Central, okay, great. Let's see. How would noon your time work for you to meet with Colton today?
17208996069: That could work.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, gotcha.
17208996069: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: I just sent you another invite to connect you with Colton. For noon, so go ahead and accept that when you can. And if you have any questions in the meantime, let me know. I'll send you a recap email that you can share with some of your clients today.
17208996069: Okay. And yes, I have not seen that email come through. There it came through. Yep. I will accept that one. And we should be set.
Jacob Greenberg: Alrighty.
17208996069: Okay, well, thank you so much for your help.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, of course. I'm happy to help.
17208996069: Well, you have a good one.
Jacob Greenberg: You too, and I'll talk to you next week.
17208996069: All right, sounds good. Thank you.
Jacob Greenberg: Good luck, Eric. I'll talk to you later.
17208996069: Thanks. Bye.
