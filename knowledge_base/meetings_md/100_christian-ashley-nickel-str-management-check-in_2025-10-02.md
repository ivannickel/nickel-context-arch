Ashley Eaton: Where. If we're bringing on new programs. But Jody does most of the, like, day to day operational stuff, so she'll be the one that's primarily using it once it's. Once it's up and running.
Christian Sheerer: Awesome. Have you had. Oh.
+1 817-***-**63: Can you hear me?
Christian Sheerer: I do. There's a little bit of an echo.
Ashley Eaton: But yeah, I can mute myself. We'll see if.
Christian Sheerer: That'S better now. Okay. Yeah. Jody, I know you're going to be kind of using nickel. Have you had some time to walk through a platform a little bit, or do we want to start from scratch? Do we want to pick up where you have particular questions? Sort of.
+1 817-***-**63: You. I mean, I worked with it a little bit setting up ACH accounts on vendors. Sorry, this echo is driving me nuts.
Christian Sheerer: That's okay. I. Are you able to join on audio on your computer so you don't have to call in?
+1 817-***-**63: Okay, great. Maybe.
Christian Sheerer: I'm gonna remove your phone and see if we can just hear you through your thing. If not, you might have to call back in. Okay.
+1 817-***-**63: Okay. I can just take off the video. Just get out of the video call and I'll just use my phone. You just won't see. Okay. Okay. Okay.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. Just so you're able to see.
+1 817-***-**63: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: Can you still see me and Ashley?
+1 817-***-**63: I can hear you.
Christian Sheerer: Oh, okay. Well, I just would want to be able to show you around the platform in. In the case that we need to click through anything.
+1 817-***-**63: Okay, Well, I can. Okay. I understand what you're saying. I don't know how to do that because my. My volume doesn't work on my computer. But I know I'm pretty comfortable with using this. The software. I've been setting up ATH accounts with vendors, but I guess if there's certain things you want to show me, I can log back into the meeting with the computer and just not use the telephone and just not have audio. As far as y' all won't be able to hear me. I will be able to hear you, but you won't be able to hear me.
Christian Sheerer: I think it's fine. I think. I mean, if you're comfortable, then you're comfortable. We don't. We don't. We don't want to beat a dead horse and show you things that you. You've already used. This platform is pretty simple too. I just, I guess while. While we have you on the line though, is like, are there any questions that immediately came up as you were setting up those vendors?
+1 817-***-**63: Yes, there was a question we have in our other payment application allowed us to set up two ACH accounts for one vendor. If they had, for example, two properties and they wanted payments to go to two separate places, well, nickel. Just allow one payment per vendor and we should set up another vendor. Or how do you recommend we do that?
Christian Sheerer: I think the easiest way just in my head, would be to set up another vendor. But let me try to troubleshoot and see if we can't add up. So you might just add them as number two.
+1 817-***-**63: A different vendor.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, like five.
+1 817-***-**63: Yeah, yeah.
Ashley Eaton: Hey, Christian, one reason we're trying to get away from that and maybe we can do it. I don't know if QuickBooks allows for like, nested or sub vendors. But our. We do a lot of tax tracking in 1098, 1099 reporting through our like trust accounting software, which is called VR platform. And it is tied with one to one with a QBO vendor. And so if we split them up, it's gonna try to split up the tax reporting for the two different people. So that's why we're trying to figure out if there's a different way to do it.
Christian Sheerer: Mm. Adding multiple accounts to the vendor. Yeah. Because I mean, we should be able to. We just need to. So you can change it on the bill that's going out to them. So, for example.
Ashley Eaton: So just in the nickel side of things, maybe, or something.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, exactly. So if I'm going to send a bill to this guy, I want to make a payment. This is your payment method. So this is how you're paying as str. You can set up a new delivery method, but then you'd have to do that every time for each new bill that's going out to them. That might be tedious. Let me see if there's a way that we can nest it. It's typically one to one, and so that's something that I'm gonna have to take away as. As, you know, I don't know, off the top of my head.
+1 817-***-**63: Yeah.
Ashley Eaton: If you don't mind getting back to us on that, I'm looking at a way just to make sure there's not a way to tie the tax reporting for two different QBO vendors to the same person in the software that's doing our tax reporting for us. Because that would solve it too. But I don't know. They like a one to one connection as well.
Christian Sheerer: I'm gonna see if I can get like a live answer from our dev team right away too.
+1 817-***-**63: But.
Christian Sheerer: But I will. I will pull that out as homework for myself as well.
Ashley Eaton: Jodi, the other thing Then I have not run this by you yet. Is eventually we'll want to move the tenant rent payments over to nickel as well because they can process debits too.
+1 817-***-**63: Okay.
Ashley Eaton: So that would just be later this month before the November rent processes in Forte. So we'll just need to, you know, stop those recurring transactions in Forte, set them up in nickel and then I don't know that we. Christian, in terms of like recurring payments, what's the best way to handle that? Do we set up recurring bills in QuickBooks and then. But then have to go into nickel and process it every time?
Christian Sheerer: It is. It's a two way thing. So if you set up a recurring bill in nickel, you can also push into QuickBooks. But I always like having QuickBooks as sort of the source of truth. Did you in. Does it, does it have on your account the imported invoices already?
Ashley Eaton: We do have recurring invoices set up in QuickBooks. The problem is we don't. They don't necessarily always stay up to date prior to the rent payments processing. Sometimes we'll go back and edit them. So like we wouldn't. And we just have a ton of vendors in there and customers in there too that we wouldn't want auto processing happening for.
+1 817-***-**63: So.
Ashley Eaton: So yes, the recurring invoices are happening in QuickBooks. So they will be pushed to nickel. But it sounds like probably the best solution.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, I see. So go ahead. Sorry. What. What's your best solution?
Ashley Eaton: Well, is. I'm it. I'm wondering if the best solution is for QuickBooks to generate the invoices. They get automatically pushed to nickel. But then is Jody going to need to go in on the 1st of every month and then actually process the payments for those invoices?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, you can. Yeah, it would. You would, you would send them out to get requested. But you could do it. You could do it or open, I.
Ashley Eaton: Mean, I guess alternative.
Christian Sheerer: Filter it by the date.
Ashley Eaton: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: So that might be a good way to do it as well.
Ashley Eaton: I'm wondering if the alternative. Because nickel will create invoices in qbo. Right. Like if we just set up transactions there. So would it. Is there a way to set up like a recurring transaction in nickel and then just have it automatically create the invoices in QuickBooks?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, so okay, that's.
Ashley Eaton: I think because I just would hate for Jodi to have to like, you know, if the first is, you know, on a day she's out of town or something like to have to be online the first of every single month to run these.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. And you want them to just be sort of ready to go and send out to them. Yeah.
+1 817-***-**63: Auto.
Christian Sheerer: Where you just like automatically. They're automatically sent to them.
Ashley Eaton: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: So these ones that I got. So I'm seeing. And I'm in your account and I'm seeing a bunch of Airbnb stuff. Are those. Yeah, that ones.
Ashley Eaton: No, they're not. They're not Airbnb. We, I mean, we have obviously that most of our income is coming from Airbnb, but we're looking specifically at like long term rent tenants. So if you filter out. Let me see what we can search for ltr maybe see if this will pull it up. Yeah, if you search by ltr, that should pull up the long term tenants.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, so yeah, I'm seeing seven of those.
Ashley Eaton: That sounds about right.
Christian Sheerer: And so you can send the payment requests in bulk. So you can click all of them, filter for ltr, click on all of them and send them out in bulk and add. Add the recipients if there's. You can double check if there's not a recipient there. So that might be one way to do it pretty efficiently. Or you set up the recurring payment in nickel. For.
Ashley Eaton: Where would we set up the recurring payment in nickel? If we go that approach?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, I'll show you. You don't mind that I'm going to show you your account, do you?
+1 817-***-**63: No.
Christian Sheerer: Okay.
Ashley Eaton: We're both in there all the time.
Christian Sheerer: Cool. So you would set it up here and then maybe for Adam, add his email address recurring. But I don't know if there's.
Ashley Eaton: We may have to add. We don't often. Well, yeah, I can look at the item options, but.
Christian Sheerer: Okay. Yeah, you'd have to add. So.
Ashley Eaton: Yeah, we can just add a rent item there.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. And then, and then you can set it up to be recurring when the invoices will go.
Ashley Eaton: Go up and then will that. Once that invoice is generated on the 1st of every month, will it process the payment also or is it just requesting the payment?
Christian Sheerer: It's requesting. But if you have their payment information.
Ashley Eaton: Yeah, we have their ACH information and we like to just go ahead and charge it.
Christian Sheerer: Yep. And you can do that.
Ashley Eaton: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: If you have their authorization. Yeah.
Ashley Eaton: And that will only happen for the invoices that we set up this particular way. Right, those auto charges.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, you, you. Yeah, you have to set up authorization for them to allow it to be auto charged versus if I'm just sending out a request that they can then manually go and open that request and pay out against the payment link.
Ashley Eaton: So Jodi, we can work on this together after the call too, but it sounds like that's the best option is to. To delete the recurring invoices that are currently in QuickBooks so that it doesn't generate anymore, and we'll set them up here in nickel so that we can set up.
+1 817-***-**63: Okay, got it.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, maybe. Yeah. Or you could filter for LTR and then send out the payment requests.
+1 817-***-**63: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: But for those customers, so we have ltr, you're to be able to charge them. You're going to add their payment method.
Ashley Eaton: Okay, yeah, we can do that.
+1 817-***-**63: Yeah, we can do that.
Christian Sheerer: You can also request it from them through nickel if you. If you don't already have it. If you bring on somebody new.
+1 817-***-**63: Great. Okay, great. That's awesome. I like it. I like this software.
Christian Sheerer: Cool. I'm good. I'm glad to hear it. Yeah, I like it, too. I've been here for a couple months, and it's, like, been easy to wrap my head around it, which is a new thing if you start kind of.
+1 817-***-**63: Articulating software to somebody.
Christian Sheerer: And it's always pretty easy for people to digest it. And I think over time, we're going to build out some more stuff, obviously. Right. Like, any software.
+1 817-***-**63: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: But we really kind of like to think of our design language as, like, as simple as kind of make it foolproof for your customers to pay you, because we always want to reduce as much friction as possible there and, like, make it, you know, dead simple for you to pay vendors as well.
+1 817-***-**63: Right.
Christian Sheerer: That will likely never change.
+1 817-***-**63: Where are y'? All?
Christian Sheerer: Basically, where we're based in Brooklyn. Most of us are in Brooklyn. We have a couple people outside of New York. Yeah.
Ashley Eaton: Jodi, we can also use this for other, like, vendor payments, too, if there's somebody that you need to pay. I'm actually hoping to eventually get it set up for the cleaning company also. Yeah, we can pay those laundry invoices, and you can just click to.
+1 817-***-**63: To make the case. That'll be good. Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah.
+1 817-***-**63: So that's.
Ashley Eaton: That's next.
+1 817-***-**63: Okay. Sounds like we in. Yeah. All right.
Ashley Eaton: I think that. Jody, unless you have other questions, I think that gets us to where we need to be for nickel.
+1 817-***-**63: Yeah, I think so.
Christian Sheerer: And you said you had. You had some ready to go for. Do you want to check in after those first couple of LTRs and vendor payments go in?
Ashley Eaton: I mean, we can't.
+1 817-***-**63: I'm.
Ashley Eaton: I'm happy to just reach out. I actually did do a test transaction on the payout side for it. It's Like a, it's a, it's another bank account I have access to and so I was able to like actually see that that made the deposit. So. And it went through. Great. So Jodi, I sent like a 45 cent transaction.
+1 817-***-**63: 45.
Ashley Eaton: Yeah, the LAT Investments account, like a pretend payout for one of Ames's properties and it went through. Great. In two days. So.
+1 817-***-**63: Awesome. Okay.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, so I'll get you my, my, my homework to you shortly. And yeah, we can, we have a customer success team. But I can introduce you to them asynchronously over email in the case that you need to contact of come up with you know, questions or feedback or things like that that like are not tech related. Like you know, tech support is always available for the more kind of technical questions and he can help field you field those and kind of point you in the right direction or be able to handle them. So.
Ashley Eaton: Okay, sounds good. Yeah, that'd be great.
+1 817-***-**63: Right? Yeah, great.
Christian Sheerer: Cool. Alrighty. Well, yeah, I mean I'm always available too so that, that, that thread is going to be open to you as well. But sounds like we're in a good spot. And let me just round out the conversation after I get confirmation on how same customer, different accounts might work.
+1 817-***-**63: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: And then we will, I think be totally clear.
Ashley Eaton: Oh, Christian, one more question for you. Once I sort of want to do a month of this company and then I'll start thinking about the other one, but the other cleaning company owned by the same guy but completely different set of books is if we want to bring that company on board to start using Nickel, should I just reach back out to you and it'll be like a new onboarding process or I just sign up on the Nickel website and go from there? Because the other question I had is how obviously it's like the same user groups and so can we use our same user login and access both companies? How does that work? Do you know?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, yeah, you can a couple things. So one, depending on when you'll want to do that, I can make sure that they change. So we, the language we use is like. Sorry, there's a fly flying around. The language that we use is accountant structure. Because we, you know, the way we built that out is like around accountants who have clients who they run their AP and AR for. And so it would just be an accountant's account, but it's the same as having like a parent account and a child account.
+1 817-***-**63: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: It doesn't change. And so yes, and if you want me to do that Now, I can do it for you now and be the higher account. And then you have a client under. And then the cleaning company is the second client. Or you can always reach out to support and ask them to switch out the account structure that way.
Ashley Eaton: Okay, let's hold off for now. I sort of want to have one ball in the air at the moment and then. Well, yeah, I'll reach out once I'm ready to get going with that one and have them switch it over to the accountant structure.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, cool. Yeah, and I'll make a note of that in. In my recap email to you as well. And the only other thing, and I'll make a note of this as well, is when you. If it's the same, like, owner, like information, you just need to put an email alias. If it's John at cleaning company or if it's the same email like johnstrmanagement.com and then the second one for the cleaning company. You want to use the same email to set up the business account. Just do John +1@strmanagement. If your email domain allows the alias just because. Yeah, the way the infrastructure is set up, it's like we technically tie one email to the other, but if you use an alias, that's a way around it.
Ashley Eaton: That's fine. We have. We've got lots of aliases we can work with.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, perfect.
Ashley Eaton: Cool. I think that's it.
Christian Sheerer: Great. Okay. Yeah, well, I'll be monitoring them, see, make sure everything's all good. I'll be back and forth in the support conversations as they come up. And so I'll always be here. And then as you guys start to get ramped up, reach out to me if you want to add in that account structure or reach out to support and they can do it quickly. Then I'll also introduce you asynchronously to our customer success team.
Ashley Eaton: Sounds great. Thanks for your help. I appreciate it.
Christian Sheerer: No problem. Thank you for being responsive in the back and forth and heading this project up.
Ashley Eaton: All right.
Christian Sheerer: All right. Jody, nice to meet you.
+1 817-***-**63: All right, likewise. Nice to meet you too. Ashley, do you want to stay on for a second or.
Ashley Eaton: No, let's. Let's jump off and I'll call you separately.
+1 817-***-**63: Okay, sounds good. Thanks. All right, bye, everybody. Bye.
