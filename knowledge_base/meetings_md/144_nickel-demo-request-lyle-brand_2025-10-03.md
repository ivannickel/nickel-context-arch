Lyle Brand: A a program called Shapers that does all of our booking, accounting, everything in, in one. It's a proprietary thing just for, for extreme meeting.
Jacob Greenberg: It's called Shapers.
Lyle Brand: Yes.
Jacob Greenberg: S H A P E R S.
Lyle Brand: H A F E R S Sorry, one more time. S H A F E R S.
Jacob Greenberg: Got shape first. Interesting. There's so many, you know, so we work with a lot of like contractors, construction companies and stuff. And there are so many unique tools to each industry. Like there's one called Roofer for roofers and then there's some for vending machine companies. You'd be. It's crazy. There's so many. Okay, great. So, so this will be pretty straightforward. I'm going to show you inside the system a little bit. I do think nickel is going to be a good fit for you guys. I'll walk you through kind of the basic workflow, show you some of the abilities we have to be able to help you better collect your payments and to do it cheaply. And I will also walk you through what it looks like for next steps and pricing should you want to move forward.
Lyle Brand: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: So this is get nickel.com. let me, let me log into my demo environment.
Lyle Brand: Here we are.
Jacob Greenberg: Can you see my screen here, Lyle?
Lyle Brand: Yes, yes I do.
Jacob Greenberg: Fantastic. Okay, great. So this is within Nickel. Once you create your account you'll have this summary page which is just a high level overview of all the transactions you've had recently. And this is the transactions page here where you'll get to see all of the transactions that you've had at a high level overview where it's going to the well like how the money's moving, where it's coming from, going to the amount and the status of that transaction. So this is downloadable as a CSV and you could also filter if you want to do a day in or day out report just to get one day at a time. I don't have any transactions from today here just to download to import into whatever accounting system you guys use. Just a quick high level overview. But essentially you could think of nickel as a place you're going to go to manage and organize all of your cash flow when money's coming in and coming out into your accounting system or into your bank system or going out for payments. So I'm not sure if you guys have a unique method you do for bill pay, but we also offer, if you sign up, we have an accounts receivable tab under get paid. You don't have to use both of these, but if you wanted to do Bill pay through nickel as well. You have the ability to do it too. Now in the invoices tab of get paid is really where you're going to be looking at all of your invoices and the money coming in towards you. Before I walk through creating a unique invoice, I'm just going to show you this Easter egg really quick. Some of our companies that we work with like to use this, some don't. Just depends on your business. But this is essentially a payments portal that you would customize when you come in to create your account. You go into account settings and you'd upload your logo and an image or a banner and customize it so it's based on your business. And then this would say, you know, Peter's associates, it have your logo, any image, and it's a custom payment portal link that you could put directly on your website. So you just embed that as a link of like make payment on Peter's associates. So let's see. So if you go to this pay now section, looks like you guys have this e Invoice by Valor PayTech. So pretty much the similar thing. Be able to customize this to have whatever type of information you want. Does Valor cost money for people to pay in credit card or NCH right now?
Lyle Brand: Yes, but we, we charge the customer that they pay for that.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. So when I put in my information and I make the payment, it's going to automatically add the credit card amount on top?
Lyle Brand: Yeah, yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: So same thing here. You fill out the information, it gives the customer the option to pay via ACH or via credit card. And if you do decide to pay by credit card, there's a 2.9% fee and it gets put onto the customer. Now I'll walk you through what it looks like to actually create an invoice from within nickel right now. How are you creating your invoice from within your accounting system?
Lyle Brand: Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, so what you would do here is you come into nickel and you add your customers. So let's say I'm going to do Peter's Associates demo. Put my email in here so that it's easy for us to see what the invoice looks like. Do you guys use invoice numbers or purpose statements?
Lyle Brand: Invoice number. Got you.
Jacob Greenberg: Do an invoice number here. And what's the average size of the invoices that you guys are sending out?
Lyle Brand: I mean, could be anywhere from $200 to like $4,000. Got you.
Jacob Greenberg: Do you guys do net terms?
Lyle Brand: No.
Jacob Greenberg: Same day charges.
Lyle Brand: Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: So you could add any notes for the customer and go here and you can also attach some documents. So right here you'd be able to upload the invoice itself. Like a downloadable line item invoice, you'll be able to upload any contractual agreements. You have photos of the job site. It'll all live on one custom digital portal for the customer. So it's easy to keep track both internally. Reduce like the amount of back and forth you guys have. Coordinate, put everything in one place and externally for your customer's sake. Can you go ahead and create under.
Lyle Brand: Under the advanced tab there? Yep. Add a spot for. To disable the credit cards.
Jacob Greenberg: Yep.
Lyle Brand: But I was talking to somebody and they said that's only for the service that you pay for, not for the free one. Is that correct?
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, that is for our plus service.
Lyle Brand: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: What would be your interest in disabling the credit card?
Lyle Brand: Well, I'm not sure how our customers are going to feel about, you know, two different ways to pay credit cards, but that would be, I guess, a test. Now, doing the credit cards, do we then have to get a new merchant ID and everything or you guys are the merchant?
Jacob Greenberg: Nope, you don't need to get a new merchant ID or anything just to accept credit cards.
Lyle Brand: So you guys are the physical merchant then?
Jacob Greenberg: For the merchant processor.
Lyle Brand: Okay, what will show up if both ways? If they ACHs and if they pay by credit card, what will show up on their statements?
Jacob Greenberg: On their bank statement?
Lyle Brand: Yes. Will it have our name or your name?
Jacob Greenberg: No, it'll have your name. It's who you paid.
Lyle Brand: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: So here we'll have. So here are the settings you were referring to before the disabled credit card payment setting. And you can. Most customers that use nickel keep this enabled just because you're. And I'll show you what it looks like here. So you can send this out via.
Lyle Brand: Let's see.
Jacob Greenberg: Request the payment here. I'm going to send it out via email, but you could also send it via text if you want. If you do have the customer information on file, you can set to just charge the customer directly from nickel and auto charge it. You would need the permission to do so though. So I'm going to send the link here. I sent it twice to myself. And here we go. This will say your company name, says you have new payment request. Any attachments are included in the email. But also in this invoice here and you're presented with the two options to either pay by bank or to pay by card. So really the idea here is to give your customers option to pay however they would prefer in a single portal. And understand I could get the cash flow advantage of paying by card, but I would be charging an additional 2.9% fee. Or I could just pay with no card, pay by bank and pay with no fee as well. Any notes are included here. They do have the ability to update the payment amount if you so choose. So that they can do half a credit card or half an achievement. Or if you guys ever do jobs that require deposits before the full balance is to, they could decide to make those payments this way. And you can still track the amount that they've paid. So once they complete this tab, it'll move over here into the completed section and you'll be able to see which transactions have been completed. Very, very straightforward. Is this kind of what you were looking for, Lyle?
Lyle Brand: Pretty much. Let's have a couple of questions. We've answered most of them. So we can send an email or a text link. Got that. And a customer can pay without an invoice, so to speak. So like you said, with that link, you can put on the website, they don't actually need an invoice, they can just make a payment.
Jacob Greenberg: That's correct.
Lyle Brand: He said we can make that, say whatever we want. We have. We can set that up.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, you just. We would have to do it for you, but you could just let us know what you wanted to say.
Lyle Brand: Okay, that's the blank invoice. Let's say we did do the one where it's like $35 a month or $45 a month. Do you bill monthly or do you bill yearly for that fee?
Jacob Greenberg: So it depends on how you want to splice it. So if you do go with the annual billing, it's essentially a 20% discount. If you do, you can go monthly as well, and it'd be $45 a month. So it's $420 at once to pay for the whole year or $45 a month.
Lyle Brand: And I assume that would be ach right out of our account, so to speak, for the.
Jacob Greenberg: To make the payment. Yeah, it's. However you choose to make the payment, you can put it on the credit card, you can put it on bank to bank. Yep.
Lyle Brand: Let's say I sent someone a invoice for $500, but I made a mistake. It should be 550. Can I edit it?
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, you can edit it before it's been completed. And if, if it has been completed and you want to do a refund, you could process a Refund easily as well and send out a new invoice.
Lyle Brand: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: But before the transaction has been completed, you could come in and you could click edit invoice here while it's still active.
Lyle Brand: What if I send an invoice and I send to the wrong customer? Can I delete it?
Jacob Greenberg: Yep. You could delete the invoice by clicking delete right here.
Lyle Brand: Even after it's been sent, I can delete it?
Jacob Greenberg: Yep.
Lyle Brand: And then if the customer does try to go to pay, it'll say there's nothing to pay because it went. You said refund. So let's say if someone paid us 500 bucks and they should have only paid us 450, you said I can refund them the. The $50. Is there any charge for that?
Jacob Greenberg: No, there's no.
Lyle Brand: And that's just ach back to either their checking account or if it's credit cards, back to their credit card, Correct?
Jacob Greenberg: Yep, that's correct.
Lyle Brand: For the free version, there's absolutely no hidden fees anywhere. Correct. No fine print. I'm not seeing or reading or anything or any contract I have to sign with you guys. No.
Jacob Greenberg: But just to sign up and get going, at the end of this call, you could create a free account. You could log in and you could play around if you would like. And whenever you're ready to upgrade based on the features you would want to get, you could just go down here to account settings and you click on players and you can upgrade on your own whenever you're prepared to do so.
Lyle Brand: Okay. Yeah. And if I upgrade and I don't need that, I can downgrade, I guess you're allowed to. If I went with the monthly. I guess.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah. If you're on the monthly plan, you could cancel your plan and then you could just proceed doing nickel core. But if you do the annual, you know, it's. It's up front. So.
Lyle Brand: I see there it says physical checks, $2 per check. What do you mean by that?
Jacob Greenberg: We can send checks on your behalf. It just cost $2 per check if.
Lyle Brand: I use the bill pay option, is what you're saying correct?
Jacob Greenberg: Y.
Lyle Brand: What if I use the build play option where I guess, how would it ach them? Would I have to get their bank info to put in for you to pay them? Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: So I can walk you through this real quick. You go to your vendors page and you create a new vendor and you would need to have either their information or request their information to make the payment. So if you do have their info, you could set it right here and you could add the details for if you want to make a wire pay by check or pay by achievement. But if you do want to request their information, you'll have it already. I'll show you what it looks like here. You can require your vendors to log into their bank to ensure the payments to the vendors are successful. Or you could require only ACH payments from them. And you're going to be sending out an email invite and I do have to hop off in one sec. Lyle, an email invite to them that looks like this and it will say, you know Peter's associates wants to send you money via nickel. And they'll have a quick little screen here that shows them exactly what this is for to get started and then ask them to enter some basic business information linking their bank account review and submit. Once they do that, and this is optional like you could also just collect the. If they say, hey, send it to my bank account, this is my ach and they email it to you, you would just go in, find that person and you would add their payment method here. And if you want to just send a check to an address, all you would need is their address to send that check to and we would send it for you.
Lyle Brand: And if people pay us by ACH or credit card, they can choose if they want to keep that information on the system to use for another day.
Jacob Greenberg: Exactly. Yep.
Lyle Brand: So they guess to do that or no.
Jacob Greenberg: So if they pay via, they pay via the invoice itself. That will be a one off transaction unless they previously saved their information. If you want to have their information saved on the account, what you would do is you do go into that customer page, say create a new customer. Right. So I think I did it for Peter's associates. Yep, there we go. I'll add a payment method and I'm going to request it from the customer instead. So I can either enter myself, send them an invoice where they enter it one time to make that payment or use update info. I could send the request to the customer to have them update it. Just give one second here, I'll show you what that looks like.
Lyle Brand: Here we go.
Jacob Greenberg: So again, your customer name and logo for your company name. It's very similar page. What is this authorization for? Why do they want my information? Who is nickel all about our compliance. And they just pop in here and accept the terms and conditions, which they can read in detail by clicking this terms and conditions button. And then they'd enter their card or bank info. Now once they do that, they're pretty much giving you permission to auto charge.
Lyle Brand: And are you all, I guess protected against, you know, someone trying to commit fraud to, you know, try to use credit cards that don't exist or you know, trying to run like $1 transactions and if it gets denied?
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, we have a pretty serious fraud protection system here. We're reviewing most transactions, we're reviewing most accounts. We do background checks on like fraudulent seeming transactions that make alarms go off. There's a pretty thorough process here. And the level of our security is one reason why we're able to offer free ach. It just creates a safer network.
Lyle Brand: The same thing for like ACH from our checking account. Nobody can go in and make withdrawals from our checking account, only deposits, correct?
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, that's correct. And there's also systems in place so that if you do want to make payments and do the bill pay option through nickel, you could sell like manager approval. So you could have someone else that creates those payments, but someone else within the company needs to approve them before they go out. A lot of different like safeguards that you could put in place to customize to your preference.
Lyle Brand: And if I never set that up, then nobody can pay anything out of our account, correct?
Jacob Greenberg: Exactly.
Lyle Brand: All right, so the last question is that website linked, how do I go about getting that set up? What info do I need to give you?
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, it's very easy. So once you create your account at the end of our call today, you'll go into the system, log in, and then on the invoices tab, you'll see on the top there's going to be a button that says payment portal.
Lyle Brand: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: You click it, it will hyperlink out to your payment portal and you just copy and paste that link into your website. So you'll click that into the pay now part of your website where there's currently. What was it called again? Something? Pay.
Lyle Brand: Fair Pay Valor P. Valor P. And.
Jacob Greenberg: You would replace that link and you'd have the payment portal link up there. Just make sure to go into your settings and update your logo and your.
Lyle Brand: Branding before you do that, okay? Okay, I'll give it a try.
Jacob Greenberg: Sounds great. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out via email and I'd be happy to support you.
Lyle Brand: L. Okay, thank you. Appreciate it.
Jacob Greenberg: You got to have a good day.
