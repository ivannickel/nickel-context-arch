Shannon R: Hi, can you hear me?
Christian Sheerer: Hey, Shannon. Yeah, how's it going?
Shannon R: Good, thanks. I'm not going to turn my camera on because I'm not camera ready.
Christian Sheerer: Oh, no worries. I'll. I'll put myself in the same boat as you then.
Shannon R: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: And yeah, we can just have a nice. You can still see me though, or you saw me and you could still see.
Shannon R: Yes, I did. Yes.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, cool. So if I show my screen, you can still see it. Awesome.
Shannon R: Yes.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, sorry about the delay. Was running over on another call. I have no worries about four back to back right at lunchtime.
Shannon R: Oh, that must be tough.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, no, it's good. Busy is better than staying sitting around and doing nothing, so I can't complain.
Shannon R: Right.
Christian Sheerer: But yeah, I know that, you know, you're over there running Rest Easy bookkeeping, and I have kind of an idea about what you could be looking at us for, but with the, you know, 30 minutes we have. Want to get a sense of what your clients are looking like, if this is for you and your clients or just you or just them and what their payments kind of situation and infrastructure looks like today and how then we can get into like what nickel looks like, how we might be able to fix some things that you're dealing with or just provide an overall better experience, fit into the payments infrastructure and workflows that you guys work on. And then if it seems like a good fit, we can get signed up and start to run transactions. Does that sound good in terms of like, game plan?
Shannon R: Yes. I can narrow down the focus here. So it's just for me, because I, I don't think, even though I'm a bookkeeper, I don't manage other people's AR or ap. And. And so I'm thinking I don't need to sign up as an accounting firm. I can just sign up as an end user because it's just for my own payments. Although if my. And what's driving this right now is QBO accounts are getting hacked more than I'm. More than I'm comfortable with. And they're doing it despite all security measures being set up properly because they're somehow going through into it and like saying they're, you know, I'm not sure. Nobody knows exactly how it's happening. So I just want to get. I feel very vulnerable. I want to get off there as soon as possible. And so, so let's see. Is there a. I just. Let me just hit you with a few questions and then what I'm really looking for, my ideal would be besides The ACH being free. I would like something that is pretty much as easy as QBO payments. I tried Melio in the past. My clients hated it and it's. And so my. One of my questions is, can they pay, get nickel, you know, invoice requests or, you know, with the payment link without having to actually have a nickel account? Can they just plug in each time their bank account routing number, you know, and, and account number or credit card information without having to sign up? Or do they have to sign up and connect their bank account?
Christian Sheerer: No, nobody that you're dealing with outside needs to sign up. We'd love them to have the platform. Right. And use it, but no, I mean, I think the number of customers that we have, the number of people who use us. So like we have another number of customers who have accounts and run us. Right. I think the number of people that actually interact with us is like a thousand times that. Right? If. Okay, right. So it's like. Or maybe not a thousand. Maybe like a couple hundred times that. Right? Because ultimately, yeah, not everybody who's using nickel to pay our customers and the people who use our platform is on the platform. So. No.
Shannon R: Okay, very good.
Christian Sheerer: Short answer is no. Yeah.
Shannon R: Great. So I'm hoping I can see a demo of what it looks like for them to pay outside of, you know, just outside the system or whatever you want to call it. So my next question will be, is there a non plaid way to connect a bank account or can you, you know, like, do you have the option of a couple of days for a bank micro deposits, you know?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. Did you. It sounds like you've already taken it a little bit of, of a dive into the system. Did you already sign?
Shannon R: I created a login, but I haven't connected my bank account yet.
Christian Sheerer: Okay. Yeah, yeah, the, the other way that we do. So we, we use Plaid for verification. It's, you know, a whole host of anti money laundering stuff, fraud prevention, et cetera. The way that you can kind of set it up with our team should you not want to use Plaid. And I guess I'm curious why. Plaid's a blocker, but we can also take like three months of bank statements and verify that way more manually. But what's, what's the, what's the hang up with Plaid?
Shannon R: You know, so many things get hacked these days that every minimizing anybody that actually has access to the bank account or has bank information. I don't know if Plaid's ever been hacked, but I'm just trying to minimize that as much as possible. And some of my clients, when I signed up for Melio, they refused to use plaid. They only went with the micro deposits.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, yeah, no worries. We can do three months of bank statements. That's sort of. I'll make a note of that as our method of getting you guys connected and so that we could do verification. But yeah.
Shannon R: Okay, great. Okay, beautiful. Let's see. Is the only two factor authentication. To use an email address. You don't use an authenticator or a code to the phone. Those seem slightly more secure.
Christian Sheerer: Phone is. I think it's primarily email, but I think phone is available as well. But I can double check. I don't know.
Shannon R: Okay. I couldn't find it. You heard of anybody hacking into people's get nickel accounts?
Christian Sheerer: Absolutely not.
Shannon R: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: Very robust security. I mean we deal with all of the major banks and the federal Reserve directly. I mean I also haven't heard much of any security vulnerabilities with plaid as well.
Shannon R: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: But yeah, not there haven't been, you know, attacks on nickels and network.
Shannon R: Okay, great. Are you guys u. S. Based support?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, US Based support during the business days during the week and but I mean, you know, small dedicated team that is right for the company. So like, you know, people give, you know, more than. I mean I'm just not allowed to promise that they'll be, you know, available over the weekend. But we see stuff all the time.
Shannon R: Yeah. If everything works properly. I. I never contact anybody. Me Leo was a nightmare because things clients couldn't pay my invoices and never once did anyone respond to any of my Melio tickets. And so I dropped them like a hot potato. That was a nightmare. So. So it looks like there's chat, email and you could even schedule a call if you needed to speak to someone. Does that sound right? You can do it. Okay, great. And now I researched a few payment systems, payment processors yesterday. So I'm not sure if I'm getting yours confused with another one, but did I now I'm not a sole proprietor. I'm a partnership. But did I see something on your thing that said that dealing with sole proprietors at this time?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, we don't. We don't have sole proprietors on the platform.
Shannon R: Why is that and is a partnership okay?
Christian Sheerer: I believe a partnership should be fine. As to why the sole proprietorship, it's just. I mean typically we're. So the story behind nickel is that we want to be the place that businesses pay other businesses essentially. Right. We were sort of set up for industrial small businesses in the first instance, like our founding story, is that our, you know, CEO co founder number one, came from DeWalt Stanley, Black and Decker and figured that for like the built world industries in America, there's not really too much of automated or Internet based or. Right. Like a quick and efficient way of handling payments. Things are just primarily done on check and all of the payments infrastructures like a stripe, melio, bill.com, et cetera, they're, you know, built to handle very small transactions. And so we said, okay, if we could handle, you know, a small transaction being $50,000 up to a million dollars and do it relatively quickly, obviously a high level of security for those types of transactions, then we could win a lot of business of, of those people who are predominantly doing it in these like inefficient ways of paper checks, et cetera. And so for that reason and because of like the regulatory kind of build out of our infrastructure that we had to do to be able to support those, we don't support sole proprietors.
Shannon R: Okay, well I, I didn't really understand that, but that's okay. So it's just not something.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, I think it's, it's.
Shannon R: I mean, are you basically saying because sole proprietors typically have smaller payments, Is that what you're basically saying? And it's not two things.
Christian Sheerer: It's a, it's a security thing. So it's very easy to set up a sole proprietorship and like try to defraud. I think it's a security thing. And then also it's like a, it's a focus thing. Like we're, we're focused on, you know, building technology for, for the, you know, founding story that got us to where we are basically.
Shannon R: Okay, yeah. So, well, I do have some contractors that are corporations and you know, there's a lot of payments back and forth between their subcontractors. So you know, I may be able to refer some of them if they want to get off QBO payments, which I will be advising everybody to get off QBO payments after what's been going on lately anyway, so I know we don't have much time. So now if I could see a, any kind of demo, I want to mostly see what, what it'll look for my clients if they don't sign up to pay an invoice. That'd be the first one, first thing, I guess. And whatever else you think to show for people, they're using it for ar.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, absolutely. And yeah, I'll say also like, while, while that was our, that's like our main focus. I think, like the people who are doing smaller transactions benefit from our main focus being around those larger ones, which is why we're allowed to offer that free. Ach. So.
Shannon R: Got it.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, there's a little bit more of like a regulatory kind of security thing that is somewhat above my head as to why we don't support sole proprietors. But it's not to say that we don't want people who are, you know, operating at a smaller per transaction amount on the platform either. Right. So it works the same across everybody. Regardless of if your transactions are, you know, 30,000 at a time or 300,000 at a time or 3,000 at a time. Do you. What. What is the typical kind of like transaction size that you're setting up? And is it recurring or is it one time?
Shannon R: I don't set up recurring payments and it could be anywhere from a couple hundred to a couple thousand.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, awesome. And what does that look like on like a month to month basis in total?
Shannon R: No more than 10,000 usually. Yeah, 10 to 15,000 or sometimes less, sometimes more, depending on the time of year and stuff.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, cool. And so when you're wanting to look at sending out an invoice to somebody and what it'll look like on their end. So we don't replace QBO as like an erp. We integrate with them directly. We also, you know, can connect up to other ERPs, but, you know, QBO is like, you know, the predominant one for our, you know, customer base. And so we just link up with them. And so if you're creating an invoice in QBO that'll come in to nickel automatically, same way that a bill would come in automatically. So it'll show up this like, icon. I've made a bunch of transactions or created a bunch of invoices that are not qbo. So that's why you're not seeing them. But it'll work in the same way. So they'll sync over from QuickBooks and then you'll be able to go and send them that invoice. So the invoice would look like this amount. The actual invoice document would live here automatically. Or you could upload a different document and then you'll see when it was sent, when it's supposed to be due, what's paid out against that amount so far. And if I want to get paid right, I'm sending this to my customer. So I'm DeGraw Distribution in this case, and I'm sending it to Christian, who's my customer and I'll send him a secure payment link. Right. And one sec, I'll pull up what that looks like. So I've sent the link. You don't have to collect any payment information. You never have to collect their account number. Routing number will store all of that. And they'll be able to put it in when they pay out against this link. And they'll get this email and say, okay, cool, Degrad distribution. Or Shannon has, you know, sent you a new payment request. Here's the bill number, here's who it's from. And then that PDF would show up, like around here.
Shannon R: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: And then they'll see all the other unpaid invoices they have from this same, you know, vendor, which is you in this case. And then they just get to be foolproof. Pay by card or. Or by the bank.
Shannon R: Okay, very good. So they. There I see right there where they enter their bank account information and never have to sign up. So a straight ach. Okay, that's perfect. That's exactly what I'm looking for.
Christian Sheerer: Yep. Never.
Shannon R: Yeah. Can you scroll down again so I can see the rest of that? Making a payment using a business account. They enter their business information. That's it. Contact information. And then they'll probably get a confirmation via email maybe once they've made the payment.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, and you can, you can set up what. What they want or what you want them to get. So I just go into notifications. I can see, hey, payment paid, failed, if a refund had to.
Shannon R: Okay, great.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. And then you'll get those same ones like, here's when it's made and then here's when it actually is cleared and processed.
Shannon R: Okay, great.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah.
Shannon R: Anything else pertinent that you can think of?
Christian Sheerer: Honestly, I mean, not really. That's as if it's as simple as that for you. That's as simple as it is to be able to send out invoices and get them paid out. You'll be able to track them over time, filter them by receivables. You'll be able to see when they're active, meaning not paid out yet completed. And all these things will sync up with QuickBooks as well. So it'll push into the completed page in QuickBooks as it happens in real time, too. And you can send reminders, you know, request payments. So the simple process would just be you have your invoices in QuickBooks, they'll sync over to nickel because you've integrated us with them. And then you come in and you request payment.
Shannon R: Okay, great. So are there. Are there any online videos, you know, if I forget anything?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah.
Shannon R: Okay. Because I didn't. I don't think I found a YouTube channel or anything like that, but maybe within the program, the application itself.
Christian Sheerer: We. We. We have a help center that I can link you to, and we do have, like, a private YouTube channel that I can send.
Shannon R: Okay, yeah, yeah, I see the help articles. Okay. Yeah, if you have a private YouTube channel, I would love. You know, once I'm up and running, it's. It's just if I can view. If I can learn it myself and not have to bother you guys, I always prefer that. Anything else I should know about? So I've already got my login, and then if I can, whether I connect via Plaid or not, how soon before I can be up and running to, you know, sync to QBO and then send out my payment request? Get off of QuickBooks payments.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, I mean, if you're able to send it over today, you can send over a transaction sort of right away.
Shannon R: Okay, so. So I either do it via Plaid if I don't have a problem with that, because I don't know how Plaid works. Do they continue to have your bank information or, you know, like, I mean, everything get. If a credit reporting company can get hacked into. You know, I don't. Is there a way to delete your bank information once you've used Plaid for the verification? You know, do you know? Or if. If you don't know. Either way. If I said I want to use you guys, I want to connect my bank account, but I don't want to use Plaid, then I send you three months of bank statements, and you can.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, you can delete your stored data through Plaid. There's a temporary verification process. Okay, but you'd have to go to Plaid directly. Yeah, I mean, you know, it's sort of these security vulnerabilities, like, proliferate as things move more digitally the same way. I don't know. I guess, like, when people started to move into cities, like, you know, urban crime started. Right. Like, whereas, you know, you're on a farm before, and. And it's. It's a different type of nefarious activity. Yeah, so I hear you, but you. But yeah, I. I kind of share the same type of anxieties because I'm like, I woke up yesterday, I checked one of my accounts. It wasn't loading correctly, and a lot of my money was like, it showed as zero. And I'm like, wait, what?
Shannon R: Oh, God.
Christian Sheerer: And nothing happened, but it was just Wasn't loading. Right. And so I was like, okay, so I share the same level of.
Shannon R: You can understand around all these.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, absolutely. And so. But yeah, it's like a temporary kind of, you know, process. It's because they're linked up with the banks, so they're not actually storing your, like, username and password to get into your account. They're just accessing bank information because they're connected to the bank basically. Like, okay, 12,000 banks have some contract or something with Plaid, and they can just see it very briefly. And then you can also delete your information from being stored with it. But if you're not comfortable with it, we can take the three bank statements.
Shannon R: And what would be the steps to that? Just email them to you, or I.
Christian Sheerer: Will email you, and you should email them to. Or. Or you already have it. Right? So if you want to do that, you email them to support. Get nickel.com.
Shannon R: Okay. And just send three months of bank statements and say you want to sign up. Or is that.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, just. I would mention that you're wanting to do a. An, you know, a different verification process than Plaid.
Shannon R: Okay. All right. And. And then. And is there anything else in the signup process that. Or I may go ahead and use Plaid? I'll probably try to do a little research on how to delete my data afterwards. But is there anything else other than just verifying? Like, let's see if I do. See, we still have a few minutes. Okay, get paid, Set up payments, and then there's a way to sync. And then complete setup. I was like, where do you add your bank information? I saw it a minute ago. Now I don't see it. Complete setup. Account setup complete. I'm not seeing where to do. Where to connect the bank account. Get paid. See, here we go. Add business information and payout method that. Okay, click to link your bank account. And then. So it says click to. To connect your bank account. And then it says, Nickel uses Plaid. And then it says, or continue as guest. Do you know what that happens? What happens there? If I say continue as guest, it looks like it prompts me, probably still through Plaid, to go to my bank account. My bank, which. My bank is there. So that's good. If there's ever the bank that's not there, can you go. Can you still use your platform or.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah.
Shannon R: Okay. All right. Okay. Anything else you can think of? I'm feeling pretty good and want to switch over to you guys as soon as possible. And then if everything goes smoothly with me, I may refer you know, at least my QBO clients, if they want to get off of this QBO payments.
Christian Sheerer: And yeah, we do very well when we have that conversation with people of who are using QuickBooks Pay and Come over to us. So, I mean, I think nothing in the terms of the setup, but I think that we should probably. If you're. Do you have some transactions you would run this week?
Shannon R: Yes, I think so. Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, so I'm happy to set up like 15 minutes on Friday just to troubleshoot how those have gone. It takes two business days to clear if it's ach, one business day if it's a card. So Friday probably give us a good buffer to have those get gone, get like, you know, processed through and fully cleared and then we can troubleshoot on that call and plus talk about any kind of brainstorming you have about a referral and set it up that way.
Shannon R: Well, what I'd rather do is just take you up on that if I have any issues.
Christian Sheerer: Okay.
Shannon R: If everything goes great, I can just let you know, you know, everything's going great and perfect. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Well, I got you back on schedule then. Here.
Christian Sheerer: No, I follow. No, no, no, absolutely. I got you back on schedule too, so I. I appreciate it. And you'll have my email, so if anything happens, you can reach out to me there. But also support will be good for those kind of direct support inquiries.
Shannon R: Okay, sounds great. I really appreciate your help. I'm excited.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, no problem.
Shannon R: Okay, great.
Christian Sheerer: And we're excited to have you, so. Yeah, thank you. And it was wonderful to meet you.
Shannon R: Thanks, you too.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, bye. Bye.
Shannon R: Bye.
