Colton O'Farrell: But that call is generally to review the transactions that you've already completed, make sure everything's working as intended, you're happy with things, and also if there's any kind of product feature improvements or requests that you have. But that all checks out for you.
Participant 3: Yeah.
Colton O'Farrell: Perfect.
Participant 1: Awesome.
Colton O'Farrell: Well, Hala, if you want to do me a favor and just go ahead and log into the Nickel platform and share your screen, I think that'd be a great place to start.
Participant 3: Okay.
Colton O'Farrell: And I was curious too, while you're pulling that up, was curious how you found Nickel, if it was a referral or like a peer of yours, if you just online Google searching or Chad GBT, just kind of curious how you stumbled upon Nickel and what got you to sign up with us.
Participant 3: So.
Participant 1: We are currently with bill.com.
Colton O'Farrell: And.
Participant 1: I'm having some issues with them.
Participant 3: As.
Participant 1: Far as shortly after we, okay, hold on one second. I apparently can't do two things at once.
Colton O'Farrell: It's all good. Multitasking is, yeah, I totally get it. So I'll let you get logged in, but when you're ready, I would love to learn more about kind of the experience with Bill. You know, we have a ton of customers that have come over from Bill and just curious if you're kind of experiencing some of the same thing as some of those.
Participant 1: So, for some reason when I go to log in any, anything with our email, I, oh, I always type in the email wrong. If I'm talking and typing the same time, I don't know why, but it's.
Participant 3: Like.
Participant 1: Like, nope, we're not gonna do that.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, no worries. That's okay.
Participant 1: So, yeah, so we, we were with bill.com originally when I signed up with them. It was like, yeah, free transactions. And then like right after I signed up, it was like, oh, well, we're going to charge you $0.59 per ACH. And I was like, well, that's not really what I signed up for.
Participant 3: Right.
Participant 1: So essentially, like it was right after we signed up that I was like, okay, well, now it's gone from paying X amount to paying X amount per transaction.
Participant 3: Yeah, curious. What?
Colton O'Farrell: So when did you sign up with Bill?
Participant 1: It wasn't that long ago. We haven't been with them for that long. Probably like six months.
Colton O'Farrell: Okay, six months. And then within that time, they've already done some kind of price within like.
Participant 1: Two months of signing up with them that they were like, oh, surprise, we're now doing this. That's going to be frustrating.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, that's going to be really frustrating. Sorry to hear that.
Participant 1: And so I was like, Okay, but here's the thing with them. They also don't break down what transactions I'm getting charged with 59 cents. It's just like, here's your monthly bill at $65.
Participant 3: Yeah.
Participant 1: And I'm like, well, where's the $65 coming from?
Participant 3: Right?
Participant 1: So I kind of let it go because at the time when I searched, I didn't see anything else that fit my criteria.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep.
Participant 1: And so ironically, I actually was looking for a free platform for my husband's company.
Colton O'Farrell: Okay.
Participant 1: And so I started.
Colton O'Farrell: What's your husband do?
Participant 1: He is, well, he has two jobs, but his company that I was looking for, he's a plumber.
Colton O'Farrell: Oh, nice.
Participant 1: And so he just started. It's a very, it's a very, it's a one-man show. Very specialized plumbing. So he's only working with very specific companies.
Colton O'Farrell: My sister's husband is also a plumber, not as specialized. What kind of specialization is your husband focused on?
Participant 1: It's not specialized, meaning plumbing, meaning he's only working with specific companies. So he's not advertising or doing anything like that. He's not running credit cards or You know, it's not day-to-day operations. It's literally specialized jobs. He's only running it for specific companies that are that are like requesting his services. And it's through his full-time job, which is a distributor. It's kind of complicated. So interesting.
Colton O'Farrell: So does he have two, is it two separate companies?
Participant 1: His full-time job is through an actual company.
Colton O'Farrell: Okay, and then he has his own kind of like private specialized practice or that he specializes in terms of the customers he's working with.
Participant 1: Correct, correct.
Colton O'Farrell: Got it.
Participant 1: And so we were looking for something that he could run ACH through. And I did a Google search, I came across Nickel and I kind of looked through the, you know, the reviews very quickly and kind of ran through all the information on it. And I said, hey, I think this would be a good fit. So I signed him up for the free platform. And then I was looking at the way I was looking on his side on the free one.
Colton O'Farrell: And I was like, what's your husband's company's name that he signed up with as well? Just curious to look at into their Silver Key Services. Silver Key Services.
Participant 1: And we've not run any, we've not run any transactions through there yet.
Colton O'Farrell: Oh, and your husband sounds like he's in the background.
Participant 3: Yes.
Colton O'Farrell: Is it Chris, Christopher? Yes. Nice to meet you, Chris. Well, if you have questions, this is also for you. Happy to talk about your specific use cases here too, if necessary. So feel free to ask.
Colton O'Farrell: My wife runs the show when it comes to that.
Participant 1: And it's something with Ashland, and that's why Daniel's not here because he's like, yeah, no, you just do all that.
Colton O'Farrell: Well, I mean, based off everything I've seen, it looks like you have a really great grasp on Nickel and running it. Wanted to just drill in a little bit more. Also wanted to ask or answer any questions if you have them. It looks like you're primarily using Nickel for accounts payable, paying contractors with Ashland specifically. Is kind of that the intent? Is there anything from an accounts receivable perspective that you're looking to run?
Participant 1: We will be, yeah, we will be using it for accounts receivable right now. I do have, because we are, we're switching over from bill.com. i do have payments for, because with the roofing industry, it's multiple payments.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep.
Participant 1: That come in from the customer. I don't want to swap. I don't want to switch.
Colton O'Farrell: Sure. Tell, tell those ones are completed.
Participant 1: Exactly.
Colton O'Farrell: And so it makes perfect sense.
Participant 1: The payment that I currently am waiting to collect from a specific from the house that we're currently finishing up on is has already been billed through bill.com so I'm just wrapping that up with him and then I'll be switching over new transactions to nickel.com cool awesome. Every all the new ones will be coming through here. I just haven't set any up yet.
Colton O'Farrell: Do you have an understanding I guess both parts so from the accounts payable side this is just helpful information for us to know in terms of like the revenue that will be processed but But from an accounts payable perspective, how much revenue do you imagine to be running through Nickel in an annual basis?
Participant 1: On an annual basis?
Participant 3: Oh.
Participant 1: Let me do this because this might give us a better idea.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, if you need to stop sharing and log in to are you also on QuickBooks, by the way, or what's your answer?
Participant 1: We actually don't. And here's why. It's kind of weird. I've never worked for a company that does this, but for whatever reason. Sorry, dog.
Colton O'Farrell: It's all good. I got my kitties by my legs right now and they're hopefully they won't be trying to fight each other while I'm on the call. But if I have to reach down, that's probably why.
Participant 1: So we have a QuickBooks.
Participant 3: However.
Participant 1: We don't run it or CPA does. We have access to it.
Colton O'Farrell: Who's your CPA? Because you could also get them signed up with Nickel. I wanted to call out. So if you see this, let me just annotate here, this box right here, if you click into that for me. And I would have recommended this possibly for your husband's account, but we can't unfortunately retroactively go back for it. But this is something that I wanted to call out specifically because if you have your accounting firm, they could absolutely sign up to use Nickel. We do pay out a referral bonus of $750 per accounting firm after they complete 10 transactions of $250 or more. We also give out a $250 bonus per business that signs up with Nickel and meets the threshold for transactions. The main thing is here that the company just has to register sign up with Nickel via your registration link right here. But once I've met that threshold, we pay that out. And if you get, well, if you get two businesses on a Nickel that are just like a per business account, that's like a $500 payout. The pricing for the Nickel Plus plan, it's either $45 monthly or it's $35 a month on an annual plan. So it's billed out one time at $420. So we give a 20% discount there. Unlike bill.com, unlike these other providers, we do not have hidden transactions or per transaction like charges. So that is the total payment you would have with Nickel unless you were deciding to eat a credit card surcharge on accounts receivable from your customers or if you're paying bills with Nickel using a credit card, there's a 2.90% rate. But besides that, if you get two businesses on a Nickel, that pays for an entire year's worth of Nickel Plus. Plus gives you $80 in your pocket. Obviously, if you get an accounting firm on there, that's even a larger payout. So just wanted to bring that to your attention as well, because we have a pretty generous referral program.
Participant 1: Okay. I'm actually on bill.com to see if I can get a report.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, export the data.
Participant 3: But.
Participant 1: Oh, there we go. Received payments. Yeah, sure.
Participant 3: We'll go with that.
Colton O'Farrell: Sorry, I did not mean to make that mark there.
Participant 1: So I don't know how accurate this is, but this shows $109,237.37 in the last six months. Since the earliest transaction was May 31st.
Colton O'Farrell: So maybe probably, I mean, you guys are obviously more, you're probably more seasonal just in relation with, you know, obviously the seasons, weather, obviously roofing.
Participant 1: And I will say this year has been extremely slow.
Colton O'Farrell: It has. Okay. So, but probably a couple hundred thousand potentially on the accounts payable side.
Participant 1: Yes.
Colton O'Farrell: And then in terms of accounts receivable, do you have that insight with bill.com as well? Or, I don't know if you were mainly just using them. Well, if you have any like insight into accounts receivable revenue that of invoices that you'd be sending to customers, having them pay.
Participant 1: That is the accounts receivable.
Colton O'Farrell: And what is it? What is the oh, what you just shared is the accounts receivable? Yeah, I got you. So a couple hundred thousand on the accounts receivable side and then accounts payable. I'm imagining it's probably what, like 50,000, something somewhere around that range, maybe.
Participant 1: Accounts payable. Let me see accounts payable. Bill payments. Oh, this is going to be harder to do.
Colton O'Farrell: And that's okay if you don't have, we don't necessarily need a specific number, but if you have just kind of a general range or idea, just helpful for our team to understand from a forecasting perspective. And we have partners that we work with.
Participant 3: Yeah.
Participant 1: It'S giving me subtotals. It's not giving me totals and subtotals. It's not giving me actual, like, just full numbers.
Colton O'Farrell: I got you. No worries. I would imagine maybe it sounds like it's under a million dollars, though, per year.
Participant 1: Yeah, I think I'm trying to think of You know what? I believe I have last year's numbers.
Participant 3: Cool.
Participant 1: Let me look.
Colton O'Farrell: And while you're doing that, I'm not sure if your husband, Chris, is still in the room, but, Chris, if you had any questions, I know you created your account here. Looks like you did link your bank account, but you haven't done any transactions through that. But if you have any questions from that standpoint and if there's particular use cases unique to you and the work that you're doing, happy to answer those for you as well.
Colton O'Farrell: I appreciate it. Yeah, there's probably going to be very few transactions and none of them will be payments out, but I'll be collecting. It's really, really all it was is that so I've been plumbing for about 16 years and I've decided to leave the day-to-day plumbing. I was a GM, master plumber, all that stuff. Oh, wow. I went to work for a sale, a plumbing sales rep. So I could still use my knowledge.
Colton O'Farrell: But not doing all the backbreaking work, sort of, but you were doing it.
Colton O'Farrell: Right, right. We'll manage a staff of plumbers and deal with all that nonsense. So I dropped my insurance, which is required for plumbing and all that stuff. So I'm still a master plumber, but I can't legally plumb because I don't have insurance. So there's been a couple of opportunities where they were desperate to find somebody to do these industrial type jobs and these specialized jobs repairs that are laid down directly from our manufacturers because of like things that were like shipping, correct or defective or things like that. Well, a plumber has to do it. Well, there's no plumber on earth that's going to do that for these manufacturers.
Participant 3: Right?
Colton O'Farrell: So they were like, well, can you do it? And I'm like, well, yeah, but no, because I don't carry insurance.
Participant 3: Right.
Colton O'Farrell: You know, so I picked up so I re bought my insurance and had to register a new company name and all that just so I can do these one off, like really odd, projects from time to time. It's not like my priority in life. I don't really want to plumb, but.
Participant 3: Right.
Colton O'Farrell: Just something to add as a pitch.
Participant 3: Right.
Colton O'Farrell: And I can charge them a couple of grand for three hours of work. I'm, like, kind of fine with that. So, yeah, absolutely.
Colton O'Farrell: Definitely. You know what I mean?
Colton O'Farrell: But a lot of it is getting paid for by the manufacturers because they're, like, defective stuff. So that basically it costs them less to fix it in the field than it does to ship it back. So, you know, so a lot of them are going to pay by like business check, which is what they're doing.
Colton O'Farrell: So, I mean, you know, there's more of a case against checks. I would, you know, I'm actually, since working at this company, I have just seen the amount of businesses who have had, like they've completely lost checks in the mail. It's taken weeks to months to receive a check or it's sent to the wrong location. So it has to get rerouted. People's checks getting stolen, mail fraud. We have a very rigorous vetting process and fraud prevention. I mean, as a financial institution, we have to meet, obviously, the Bank Secrecy Act, anti-money laundering regulations, know your customer laws. So we have a lot of.
Participant 3: Like.
Colton O'Farrell: Stoppage on those incidents, but we have exposure to them at a pretty crazy level. And it is just insane the amount of companies committing fraud, how much money that they will get from it. And checks are like a really primary way of stealing kind of those payments from businesses. And a lot of times these businesses have no idea.
Colton O'Farrell: So on your case, oh yeah, absolutely. And if it's a smaller type business, so like for example, if I was to do plumbing for like asphalt roofing, which I have in the past. They're, you know, they're a smaller company, so they would do like an ACH payment or something like that. But like, for example, the last repair that I did was for Watts Water Technology. They're like a multi-billion dollar global conglomerate. So they're like, no, no, it's all getting processed through our accounting department. Like, you have no choice. You're waiting for a business trip. I'm like, okay.
Colton O'Farrell: What leverage do you have in that situation? Yeah, right.
Colton O'Farrell: What am I going to say? They're like, no, it's getting done this way or kind of thing. They're like.
Colton O'Farrell: What I wanted to explain to you that might be helpful. And this is relevant to Hala as well for the payment portal. That's the one thing that you still need to do on your end, Hala, is when you go to your account settings, you just need to enter or add a banner that will be used for your merchant payment portal. So in addition to we can send invoices directly from Nickel to your customer via SMS or email. Email is usually kind of the default. When your customer receives that, they would have it tied to a specific invoice and could make a payment. But we also set you up with your own Merchant payment portal, which serves as kind of a one stop shop or backup method where a customer can go in there, enter any amount they want, list the invoice number or reason for the payment, click make payment, and they can pay you any amount completely for free when it comes to ACH. There's no fees for you or for your customers ever across the board with any Nickel customer, or if they want to pay with the credit card, we do allow that option. There's a 2.99% fee that the customer would pay if they decided to pay with a credit card, either for a 45 day float or credit card points, whatever the reasoning is. But that's something that we have a lot of guys who especially show up to like job sites. Some of them will take that merchant payment link. Most companies will embed it in their website. They don't have a website or they want to get it to the people actually in the field doing the job. You can just paste that link. Into a QR code, you can take a picture of it, you can like download it, print it off, but a lot of guys will just show up with their phone, show that to the homeowner, the homeowner will scan it, and they'll be able to make a payment with ACH completely for free, no fees on that, like make an electronic payment immediately, which obviously can remove the need for checks in most cases, or if they wanna pay with a credit card as well, you're not gonna be responsible for having to bake that into your pricing or deal with the PCI compliance. Nickel handles all that. You'll always just get the net amount and we would get the 2.99% from an accounts receivable perspective. But happy to show you a little bit more of that if it's something that would be helpful and relevant for you.
Participant 3: Okay.
Participant 1: So I found our 1099 list from last year. And I know last year was like a record year for Ashland Roofing. And our 1099 list was 828,000.
Colton O'Farrell: That's super helpful to know. Thank you very much. Awesome. And you said this year's been a little bit slower. Do you have- is it more so just kind of the economy, job market situation, any changes on your guys' end or kind of a hypothesis on why it's been slower?
Participant 1: We've not had any hail.
Colton O'Farrell: Oh, that makes sense.
Participant 1: So unfortunately, we are a weather-based industry. So if we don't get bad weather, we don't got no work.
Colton O'Farrell: That's fair. That's totally fair.
Participant 1: Now, I will say this, although it has been on the slower side, we have still stayed busy. And I mean busy for us is, we're steady. We've got work. We're still working. But it has been slow in comparison to previous years. Now, I will say this past last year was record-breaking for us because.
Participant 3: We.
Participant 1: Did the building that we are in. It's a smaller commercial building. It's a one-story building. It had, it got pummeled with, with a major hailstorm, we refabricated the entire building.
Participant 3: Oh, wow.
Participant 1: And we don't normally do commercial work, but because we're in the building, right? Owners are actually in an HVAC company, and they're also in the building. They asked us to do it. So that was like, that was like almost a million dollars. So it was record breaking just due to that by itself. But on top of that, this whole area that we are currently in was just disastrous when it came to hail this past year. And I don't mean like, I don't mean the year that we're in. I mean like 2024. Yeah, it was crazy. So we did a lot of We just did a lot of roofs, like a lot. And I will say that there's a lot of roofers that they're lucky enough. I say they're lucky enough, but they don't really go outside. Depending on the industry that you're in, plumbing companies, I say this because I was in plumbing for 10 years prior to working in roofing, but plumbing companies, for example, will say, We won't go outside like a 25 or 35-mile radius. Right. That's not us.
Participant 3: Right.
Participant 1: So we work in like, you know, in five or six counties.
Colton O'Farrell: What's your max distance of jobs that you've done?
Participant 1: We don't have a max distance. We work in five or six different counties. So when people say like, when you go on to like websites and it says like DFW, that's not us because we work outside of this area.
Participant 3: Right.
Participant 1: We'll go wherever we need to. And it's just makes it really hard for advertising too. But the problem is in the state of Texas, you do not have to be a, there's no licensing for roofers.
Colton O'Farrell: Makes sense.
Participant 1: I mean, the market is very saturated because every Jim Bob and, and, you know, Jose wants to be a roofer and they, they can be.
Colton O'Farrell: And they're also, that's where your reviews really stand out to let people know, hey, if you want to do it with somebody that will give you a good job, you'll be happy with, check out this. If you want to take your chances for a cheaper rate, go for it. But when your boots are leaking or it's got to be repaired five years, 10 years sooner than it should be.
Participant 1: Totally. And so there's a lot of fly by night. And honestly, because of that, that's why a lot of insurance companies are pulling out of the market in Texas. Because there are so many shady fuckers. Sorry, but they are.
Colton O'Farrell: Don't need to fall in love with this.
Participant 1: That's why they're, you know, it's illegal now to you can't wait, you know, people get away with it. I don't know how they get away with it. They word it so I've seen it on people's contracts where it's like, we'll cover your deductible. You can't do that. That's illegal. You cannot do that.
Colton O'Farrell: Well, something that you'll find at least reassuring with Nickel, I'm not sure if you've taken a chance to look at like our data privacy and network security stuff. Happy to share that information if it's helpful, but we protect all of our customers. We handle all the PCI compliance with, especially with card fees. We have talked to a lot of businesses who, when we're talking with them about their process, they are not operating in a legal standpoint and they might not be aware of that, but we instantly like using Nickel. Will make you compliant with a lot of things, especially from a card perspective, because every state can be so different with the requirements available. And if you guys are, sounds like you're mostly just in Texas, but lots of different counties. Don't know if you're crossing into any other states to do work, but laws obviously change depending where you're going. So that's one great thing with Nickel's Notetaker, that you will be covered on all of those different use cases. I know we're starting to run up here on time, so I wanted to call out that. That portal aspect quickly. If you want to go ahead, Hala, and click the account settings for me quick.
Participant 1: Right there. My window here, account settings, got it.
Colton O'Farrell: If you scroll just down a little bit to this banner page. This is something that I think you'll want to upload. Once you do that, you'll go to, and if you have an image available, you can absolutely do that. But this will show up in your payment portal that I was talking about. If you go back to this Get Paid tab here and click this purple payment portal link. This is what I was talking about of that one-stop shop or backup method. This is your link here. This can be accessed by any of your customers. Most of our customers will take this link. They'll either embed it in their website or maybe this is relevant for you. If you want to open up a new window for me and type in QR, Actually, copy this link first.
Participant 3: And.
Colton O'Farrell: Then that new window and type in QR.io.
Participant 1: Hold on. I'm going to find a way to move this. There it is.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep. So QR.io. You might need to create an account habit so you can hit enter. But if you paste that link right here in this box and then hit, so yep, this is the QR code that you have. If you take out your phone and you scan this, it would take you directly to that portal that I just showed you. Like I mentioned, if there's people that are showing up to a job site, that it might be beneficial to like maybe your people to have this QR code on their phone. They can just show the homeowner. Homeowner can scan it. If you go back to your payment portal in this Ashland Roofing, I don't know why the check marks are there.
Participant 1: Get off my screen.
Colton O'Farrell: So it would take them right to this. And if you enter put $1 in for the enter payment amount and you can just type test for the reason. And then click the make payment. This would just be this isn't tied to a specific invoice like I mentioned, but this would allow them to make a payment from their bank with ACH completely for free on both ends. They want to pay with a credit card, they can. They just have that 2.99%. That is a global like rate and rule as well. So you do have complete control over this. I imagine you would want There's probably not a ton of card payments in your industry, but if a homeowner wants to pay this, they would pay the fee. But if you go to your account settings, you do have complete control over this. So if you decided that you want to split this fee 50/50 with your customers on a global level, you can do that. If you want to eat the costs entirely, you can do that. If you want to just keep it as is where the customer generally is going to pay that full amount, you can do that. And you can actually override it on an individual invoice or customer level. Is say you have an agreement with one customer, maybe a job wasn't done quite to the satisfaction, but they want to give you a second chance. And part of that agreement is you're going to cover the cost or you're going to split some of that cost for like a card. You do have control to be able to override the global settings as well. So a lot of control there. And again, you're compliant in all 50 states with card payments. But any questions on anything before we start wrapping up? I want to also put some time on for a week because we didn't really get a chance to review the transactions. But if you're available this time next week, Hala, we would go in and review any of the transactions. And maybe, I don't know if your bill.com, like the roofing jobs you have will be wrapped up by then, but if anything, we could start getting the accounts receivable side of it set up as well.
Participant 1: But how-- I should have some by then because I think we've got a couple of repairs going.
Participant 3: Cool.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, my Thursday a week from today is pretty open. We can do the same time for next Thursday if that works for you. And that call would be to review the transactions you've done from an accounts payable as well as if you get the accounts receivable set up.
Participant 1: Yes, that'll work.
Participant 3: Cool.
Colton O'Farrell: I will send that invite over. Chris, if it'd be helpful for you to join or if you decide to get your account set up and start going through some of the workflow here, we could also cover that on the call as well. You just both let me know what makes the most sense for you and I'm here to support you. You'll be getting an email from me before end of day today that will just be providing some resources as well as just a pretty easy checklist. You've accomplished the vast majority of it so it's mostly just going to be reviewing the transactions that a week from today if that sounds good.
Participant 1: Okay, sounds good.
Colton O'Farrell: Awesome. Well, pleasure meeting you Hala. Nice to meet you too as well, Chris. I'm really excited to be supporting your businesses and I guess the last thing, if you have any questions, you can absolutely reach out to me. I do, however, typically am in back-to-back meetings most of the day. One area that I would definitely recommend is to reach out to the Help Center right here. If you click on there, it pops up in a chat window. This goes to our entire team, so this goes to support, customer success, engineering. We generally are able to, if you hit the send us a message, respond within about eight minutes within business hours there. I will always respond to an email within 24 hours. But sometimes if I'm in back-to-back meetings, might not be able to get back to it right away. So if there's any kind of question on a payment, technical issues, anything that you're dealing with, shoot them a message. They'll get on top of it right away. And again, I'll have visibility into anything in there. So.
Participant 1: Okay.
Colton O'Farrell: Cool. Awesome. Well, I hope you both have a wonderful rest of your week and enjoy your weekend. We'll be syncing up a week from today, same time. If you want to just confirm the invite once you get that from me, that makes me know that you received it and we're good for the meeting. But again, really excited to be supporting you and we'll be chatting soon. All right.
Participant 1: Sounds good. Thank you so much.
Colton O'Farrell: My pleasure. Have a good one.
Participant 1: Bye. Bye.
