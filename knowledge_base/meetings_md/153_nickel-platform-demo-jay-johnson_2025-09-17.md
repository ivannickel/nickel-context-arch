Zak George: Hi, Jay, it's Zak from Nickel. I just want to let you know my colleague are in the demo right now. Oh, yeah. So there is this link I sent you via email, j.johnson@fastsigns.com. You just have to click on that and you'll be able to hop on a Zoom meeting pretty much. Okay. Oh, so do you happen to see your calendar on the right side? There's probably going to be like.
Jacob Greenberg: Actually.
Zak George: Hey, Jacob, are you there, buddy?
Jacob Greenberg: Yep.
Zak George: Can you help me out with the link? I'm probably going to just email her the link to the Zoom meeting.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, sure. I'm happy to send it out to both of you guys.
Zak George: Yeah, please send it out. Appreciate it.
Jacob Greenberg: You got it. One second here.
Zak George: So my colleague Jacob's gonna send out the link again to the both of us. So you can just click on that and you'll be able to hop on. Cool. All right, Jacob, she's waiting.
Jacob Greenberg: Just sent.
Zak George: He already sent it, Jay. I saw the email. It says, hi, team, you can access our meeting using this link here. Were you able to see that? Oh, she's here.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay.
Zak George: All right, I'm gonna hang up.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay.
Zak George: Thanks, Jay.
Jacob Greenberg: Hey, Jay, how's it going?
julondajohnson: Wonderfully well. How are you?
Jacob Greenberg: So far so good. I'm happy we can make some time to connect this morning.
julondajohnson: Absolutely.
Jacob Greenberg: Where are you located?
julondajohnson: Atlanta, Georgia. Technically Douglasville, but yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, cool. We're both East Coast. I'm up here in New York.
julondajohnson: Okay, excellent.
Jacob Greenberg: Yes. Nice. Sorry, didn't mean to cut you off. No problem.
julondajohnson: All right, let's jump right in.
Jacob Greenberg: Awesome. All right, great. Yeah, I know you and Zak connected super briefly either last week or earlier in the week, so I just wanted to typically We just catch up by giving me a little bit of background about your business. Let me understand how you guys currently operate and then I'll give you a quick background about Nickel. Based on the info you give me, I'll customize the demo so that I'm only showing you stuff that's relevant to you guys. But I have 30 minutes on my calendar here.
julondajohnson: Does that still work for you?
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, absolutely. Awesome. Okay, perfect. Yeah.
julondajohnson: Let's kick it off by giving me a little bit of background about yourself and your business. I'll just give you the kind of high level so that we kind of stay on track. Mostly, I'm looking, if I do switch over, I want to see what the credit card speeds look like and how you guys handle that. Right now, I pay the credit card fees out of each sale, obviously. So I'm trying to figure out how we can pass that on to the customer or like what your model looks like.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. So how are you currently doing it? Is it all like in-person physical credit card machine? Are you sending invoices out?
julondajohnson: Do you use credit cards? You send invoices out. They can pay online. We do have a credit card machine. Those are the two options. You need either online or they come into the store. Obviously there's chicks and ACH and all that stuff.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. Okay, so you do have a method for sending out invoices right now. Are you seeing that people are primarily.
julondajohnson: Paying in credit card or is it. A mix between that
Jacob Greenberg: and like Jack ACH? Mostly credit cards. It's mostly credit card. Gotcha. And then what are you using to send out the invoice so that they can pay with credit card at the moment?
julondajohnson: So our franchise uses this company called CoreBridge. Everything goes through CoreBridge.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay. Gotcha. Now, I'm not super familiar with CoreBridge. Is that just merchant services or is it also like an ERP system?
julondajohnson: Our merchant service is CMS Complete Merchant Services. I think that's the full name of it.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, got it. And then for like accounting sake, are you using a QuickBooks or is that what CoreBridge is for?
julondajohnson: QuickBooks I use.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. Are you using QuickBooks online or desktop? Online. Gotcha. So right now you're sending out invoices. Do they have the option to pay by credit card or AE or is it just credit card?
julondajohnson: If they want, it's just credit cards when we send it out. If they want to set up AE, they have to go through us and then get our information.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. And there's a couple more questions here so I can get us set up. Once you send out these invoices, they're all credit card. If they want AE, they have another process that probably takes a couple more steps for you guys to do. But with the credit card, you're currently paying those fees or the customer is. Do you know what those fees are?
julondajohnson: I don't know the fees off the top of my head. I do know American Express as everyone else is always more. I think MasterCard and Visa are around the same. I just don't know those numbers off the top of my head.
Jacob Greenberg: Are you guys eating those costs right now as the business? Correct. Gotcha. Okay, so we're looking probably between 2.5%, 3.5% per transaction. Basic stuff, right? Okay. Gotcha. And then what is the typical size of your transactions? How often are you doing them?
julondajohnson: When you say size, you're asking dollar amount, I suppose.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, exactly.
julondajohnson: Our average is around $300 per year.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. And how many of these transactions are you guys doing in any any given month?
julondajohnson: Oh, man, you would ask that question. I mean, please don't get it twisted. It is not like huge numbers to the imagination. Probably around 100, no? Yeah, maybe around there somewhere.
Jacob Greenberg: And just so that I'm a little more familiar, We've had a lot of fast signs book demos this month, but you're the first that I'm meeting with. So do you guys do like recurring invoices often? Like do you send multiple bills to the same customer or are they all one off single transactions?
julondajohnson: Oh, we have multiple, we have customers at big box stores that come back often different departments and we send out separate invoices.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. Okay, great. Gotcha. All right, so based on like my estimate from the volume that you guys are doing, the transactions that you guys are doing, looks like you're paying anywhere between 500 and 1000. Most likely it's around the 800 and 900 mark as like a more reasonable conservative estimate in fees for credit card on a monthly basis. So that does add up. You're going to be looking at over 10K annually. In fees. This is an easy thing for us to help solve. I'll walk you through a little bit about Nickel, but I also want to see if there's anything else. Money is obviously the biggest motivator, but we also designed the solution to be able to make businesses have better cash flow to begin with, not just save on money, but to give cash flow advantage to businesses and also just make their internal process for AR and AP a lot quicker and easier. So as I go, I want to be able to pause and if you can interrupt me and let me know like oh, this is impactful for us or this doesn't seem to resonate as much. That'd be super helpful for us as well. But, yeah, a little bit about Nickel, and then I'll dive into the demonstration for you. Nickel was founded by our founder, led the Innovation team at Stanley, Black and Decker. So it was initially built for what we call the built world. So Contracting Services, places that typically have pretty rough cash flow problems. Right. Like they have a job coming up, they have to spend a lot of money. They still check sitting in their truck for seven days, or they've been waiting to get this check from someone for a month and a half. So they need that money to get deposited so they can do the next job. And that's the inspiration for Nickel. That's how it began. Since then, we've had a whole plethora of different business types come in. Essentially, what we did is we wanted to build a tool that would make it really, really easy for companies to offer every type of payment method to their customers. To make it so that those customers can choose however they want to pay, have all the optionality, and have it not take a negative impact on the business that they're paying as far as fees or time for that transaction to settle. We just wanted to be able to provide all the optionality, keep it hyper simple. A lot of tools are too many multi-step processes, aren't very clean and easy to use, so we thought it'd be a lot easier to do it that way. As we built out the software, we actually realized that we had the advantage of building a new tool and a lot of the other merchant services in the business have been around for a long time. So their technology is a little outdated. Because we have better technology, we're able to offer completely unlimited free ACH and we're also able to make sure that you're passing credit card costs should the customer choose to pay them in a compliant way with every single state. So different states have different surcharging laws. We handle all that for you. We also handle any PCI compliance, any SOC 2 compliance, so security compliance for handling your customer information. So you don't have to worry about that anymore. In the meantime, we also notice pretty much every business is using QuickBooks. So we have a direct two-way integration with QuickBooks. So if you're creating your invoices from QuickBooks, it'll auto populate in Nickel. You just send it out for payment. And once it gets paid or once you send it out, it will automatically update in QuickBooks. So there's no two-step process for reconciliation. You don't have to go to your bank account, make sure everything's settled. It's very, very clear and easy, and it removes a couple steps along the way. Okay, so I know you're hyper focused on saving that money, so let me hop into the demo and we'll walk through this. If there's anything here that you think is also beneficial for you guys specifically, like I said, it'd be helpful for me to know. So pop open my environment here. Can you see my screen?
julondajohnson: I can.
Jacob Greenberg: Awesome. All right, great. So I'll start with the high level overview of Nickel. Pretty much this is gonna be your transaction page. On the left hand side here we have a navigation bar. You have a quick summary of everything that's happened in the past 30 days from the summary tab. We'll be embedding some AI in this soon so that you'll be able to like look up any questions you have with your business. On the transactions tab you can see. All the transactions you've had. So whether it's receivables, if you want to do bill pays through Nickel, it just makes it easier to manage all of your payments. You could do recurring bill pay if you have Utilities or rent, stuff like that. But from the Transactions tab, you can see where the money's coming from, where it's going. Do you guys use invoice numbers or purpose statements on your invoices?
julondajohnson: Invoice numbers.
Jacob Greenberg: So this section here will have all of your invoice numbers. It'll automatically generate and sync with QuickBooks if you're using it from QuickBooks. Okay. Really easy way to just manage all of your payments, right? So this is for your cash flow, where the money's coming from, where it's going, how healthy your bottom line is. You'll be able to filter very easily by anything pending or outstanding, or you could search specific transaction IDs, specific invoices, customers, or a date range. So just makes it really easy to organize. If you want to, you could also download as a CSV. If you have it synced with QuickBooks, there might not be a need to do it. And do you guys ever deal with chargebacks being such a credit card heavy company?
julondajohnson: No, I've honestly only had one since I've been open. I know there's other fast signs that deal with it a lot more often.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. Yeah. With using credit cards and having a direct merchant service provider with typical like AMEX, Visa, American, Visa Discover, VMD and AMEX, chargebacks can start to be a big thing. We help manage very easily. We're responsible for supporting you in that process as well. So if that ever comes up, you have us to have your back as well. Okay.
julondajohnson: And then when you say, and I'm just asking, again, I've only had this happen once. What do you guys do in the event that a chargeback happens? Do you automatically just release the funds or.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah. So there will be, like, a investigation prior to the funds being released back to the customer so that we make sure that, you know, if it is a false chargeback, chargeback fraud does happen. Um, my previous, in a previous life, I was working with restaurants at point of sale systems and way more at restaurants and way, way more people are ordering on Uber all the time and then saying they didn't do it after they ate that hamburger. Yes.
julondajohnson: Um, yeah. My ex owns a restaurant, so I understand.
Jacob Greenberg: Oh man. Yeah. It's a, it's a trick. My, you know, I love restaurant owners. They're always super passionate and it's always like the hardest industry to like crack.
julondajohnson: It's exactly. Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: Crazy, but it's a fun one. But, yeah, they deal with chargebacks a lot more off, a lot more frequently than other business types. So we do a quick investigation. We make sure it's legitimate before you even have to manage anything or deal with anything. We will deal with the communications once we verify it is legitimate, Etc. So we're kind of an inter.
julondajohnson: Contact us as the owners to talk through it or do you say, okay, excellent.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay. Yeah. So over here you'll see we have. A get paid section and a bill pay section. So this is for accounts receivable. You'll be living out of get paid for accounts payable. You'll be living out of bill pay. I'll click into these in a second and show you that workflow. But before I do, I just wanna hop down here super quickly to settings. Once you set up your account, you'll be able to create a logo for yourself or add a logo and a banner. So anything that's branding, so your customers will always see your branded invoices. Okay. And when you want to set up your integration, you just pop into this integrations tab and click the link QuickBooks account. Now, just to give you a heads up, once you do this, this typically takes one to five minutes based on how much data you have in QuickBooks. Okay. Once it syncs the first time, though, it's an automatic instantaneous two-way sync. So I'm going to click into get paid here. If you've synced your QuickBooks, Everything from QuickBooks will be showing here automatically. When anything paid or settled, it will push back into QuickBooks and you'll see it under the completed tab as paid. Okay. Makes it really easy to manage all these invoices and there's that two way sync that we're talking about. So what I'll do is I'm going to create an invoice from on this account I have. Let's see. I have another account that has QuickBooks Syncs, but the only difference you'll see is the QuickBooks logo will pop up next to them once they're synced. I'll show you what it looks like to create a new invoice from within Nickel, but most of our customers that send QuickBooks will just create it from QuickBooks and then it will pop up here and then you just send it out. I'm just going to show you the. Process so that I could do a test transaction. I'll add you as a new customer. I'm going to put my email address here just so that I can show you what it looks like to receive one of these invoices. Now, if you create it with QuickBooks, the invoice number will already be populated and created for you. So will the invoice amount. Now, you have the option here to do one-time payment or a recurring payment. So if you do have recurring payments with customers, you just set the date for that payment when you want it to be paid on. And you set the schedule. If it's every week, every month, every year. For today, we'll do a one-time put any additional notes for the customers. The other cool thing about this is you could upload any documents to this transaction type. Once this link is sent, it's going to be an invoice that they can access whenever they want to, before or after it's paid, and you can add any documents. This can be a contract you have with them, a PDF line item invoice that they could download, Net Terms Agreements, Photos of the Job Site, whatever you want to communicate with the customer, you could actually keep in this one easy to manage portal to just make it a cleaner experience for them and then less back and forth for you. Okay. On this Advanced tab here, I'm going to toggle on Allow Customers to Edit the Payment Amount. So this could be used in a couple ways. One is if a customer wants to pay half in credit card, half in ACH, they're able to do that on their own. And you'll be able to track that really easily. The second component of this is if you take deposits on jobs, instead of having to send two transactions, you can. I have a ton of customers that will do deposits labeled as deposit and then invoice number and then send the final afterwards. But you could also send out that transaction. So say it's a thousand dollar transaction. The deposit is 200. They could pay the 200 upon receiving the invoice and they could pay the remaining 800 once it's complete. Just making it easy and live in one place. And that's it. We've created the invoice. So you can send this invoice request via email or by phone number. It's really easy to do on the phone also to pay by phone. So you could text it to them. If you have their payment method on file, you could just upload it here. If it's already in QuickBooks, it'll sync automatically. Or you could send out a request form, which is a really clean two-step process for them to upload their own bank info. So sometimes I'll recommend for businesses, hey, when you onboard a new customer, send them this link in the beginning, they upload their information, and now you can auto charge them upon the due date so that you don't have to send out the request and wait for it all to be completed. It'll just pop into any outstanding invoice, click charge, and you're good to go. But for now, I'll show you what it looks like to send out one of these links. So I'll go to my email here and DeGraw Distribution is the demo company we have in our demo environment. So this will say your business name. Here and the invoice number. Again, your business name and your business logo. It'll say your name, so Jay Johnson requested a payment this amount, this date, and any additional information you want on a memo can go here. And then you just go ahead and click pay now. And this is going to be the invoice portal. So any documents you've attached will be visible for download right here. If they've had previous transactions with you, it'll be visible down here. They could click into it and pop open a historic transaction. Okay. Their whole record type with you. And then this is how we offer You can either pay by bank for free. You'll see it's no fees. The invoice is $1,000. If you pay by bank, you're only paying $1,000 completely free for yourself and for your customer. Okay. Now, if the customer chooses instead to pay by credit card because it's a cash flow advantage for them, we find about 22% of the time customers end up paying our users with credit card just because cash flow advantage. Most people already have a 2-3% cash back card. Anyway, so it's like kind of evens out for them. But it will show you automatically. Nickel is going to add the additional 2.9% fee to the total line item. Okay. That you don't have to do this manually and we take care of the surcharging. So your customers say, all right, the bill's a thousand. If I want to pay credit card, I'm paying $29 more. If I don't, I'll just choose this one. It's that simple. Once they click pay, you'll see that it moves from this active invoice into the completed invoice section. Then it automatically syncs to your QuickBooks. Very, very easy to use, very user friendly. Before I dive into some more details, do you have any questions? I want to take a pause, answer anything you might have.
julondajohnson: No, actually the question I was going to have, you already answered it.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, gotcha. Anything about this workflow so far that you think is an improvement to yours or is like would make a beneficial impact?
julondajohnson: I'm loving it so far.
Jacob Greenberg: Awesome. Okay, great. One other little Easter egg I want to throw out, hold on real quick. I just want to check my, okay, cool. I have a little bit of time after this if you want to go over a few minutes.
julondajohnson: I do have one quick question. So you'll have the credit card fees already set up. So if they pay with Visa, MasterCard.
Jacob Greenberg: Discover, American Express, it's all the same rate.
julondajohnson: It's all the same rate for you all.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay. Okay. Yeah, I know, like I said, working with restaurants, that was one of the hardest things for restaurants to keep on the books and to manage is every card has a different rate depending on the exactness and the card holder and it's changing all the time. Yes. Very easy to manage. And honestly, once you set it, it's kind of set and forget it. You don't have to think about it because it's an option for your customer. You never have to think about credit card fees again. Excellent. One little Easter egg here is this payments portal. You can set this up once you upload your logo and your banner. We have customers that will put this on their website for a more generic payment link. If you do in-store purchases, for example, Chicago Brass is one of our first customers to have used this feature several years ago, so I just like to go to their website. They'll have this pay invoice button on the website. That's pretty much it. If someone comes into the store and you just want to do a very quick generic payment portal, you could direct them here. If they make a credit card payment through this platform, you don't have to take those fees. That's a nice little thing to have on the website. But also, because it's so easy to generate an invoice, If you do have a customer that's in store and wants to pay and you want to create an invoice for them, it's really as simple as putting in their name, putting in the amount, clicking create and putting in their email. It's really a two step process, three lines of information. You can get them that invoice to their phone while they're standing right in front of you. Okay. We're going to be rolling out Apple Pay actually in the coming months. So if you do have someone in store, you could send them a custom invoice. Just for them, you could track it here. They could do that double click thing they do on their phone and just pay it.
julondajohnson: Oh, excellent.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay. Yeah. So in a nutshell, that's the high level overview of the accounts receivable side. On accounts payable now, every business has their own bills they need to pay. You could set up a new bill and make a payment from here. Manage all of your vendors and see how much you've been paying them over any specific period of time. It's a little bit easier to have like a so you can kind of start to see the picture that QuickBooks is your accounting source of truth. Nickel is really your go-to spot to see everything happening with cash flow. What's coming in, what's going when it did all of that. A little bit cleaner, a little bit easier to navigate.
julondajohnson: Yes.
Jacob Greenberg: If you have other people on your team that do bill pay or that do accounts receivable, you can upload different members of your company into Nickel's AskElephant Notetaker and you could give them different permissions. So if you want to be the end all be all, you have someone on your team that creates the payment, but you want to approve each one before it goes out. That's what this permission is showing here, but it's very customizable. Okay. And you can set recurring bills as well. So you'll see all of your active recurring bills and you can create new ones. So you could say, you know, real estate company and then create a new vendor. You could either add their information if you know how to send money to their bank already, or you could ask them to fill it out. Okay. And then you could just set a recurring bill. So on the first of every month, you automatically send them an X amount of money. The same way you could set a recurring invoice where it automatically charges on a weekly basis or a monthly basis. And that's Nickel in a nutshell. High level view, it's super easy to implement an onboard. So we do have two plans. The reason I asked for the typical volume of your transaction or size is because we have two payment plans here. I'll show you them. You can get set up and going right away for free. So Nickel core is zero dollars a month. There's a three day business turnaround for ACH and two day for credit card. Yeah. The only big difference between these two, the 35 a month plan and the core plan, is that on the core plan, the largest individual transaction you can do is 25 000 per transaction. On the Plus plan, you could do several million in a single transaction. It also has one day quicker turnaround time. So you'll have a two day turnaround time for ACH or next day turnaround for credit card. Okay. So because of your transaction size, you can definitely get set up and going in a matter of minutes with the free plan to play around with it. If you ever want to upgrade, you could do so on your own from within your platform. If you have one really big transaction coming in, Or if you decide, hey, $35 a month to get one day quicker turnaround is worth it. Your call, you can set it up whenever you're ready to do so.
julondajohnson: Gotcha.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay. Going a little bit over and that's cool. I have some extra time. Jay, on a scale of one to 10, how are you feeling about implementing a tool like this?
julondajohnson: Oh, I love it. I love the savings. I love how easy it looks. Um, It'll just be me trying to get in there and, you know, operate it. My only concern is how well it'll integrate with our current operating system.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. Is your current operating system also synced to QuickBooks?
julondajohnson: It is.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. If that is the case, then everything should sync together with QuickBooks being like the source of truth for both. Okay, so everything being pushed for so walk me through kind of the process of how you're using your other operating system and how it's connected to QuickBooks what info is going back and forth?
julondajohnson: So mostly our transactions so like our overall system is called core bridge that's what people pay through our system we send it out through core bridge our Credit card services, CMS, complete merchant services. And then all that stuff happens. I have no idea. I'm not going to pretend. But I do know that complete merger service, next so all these things are integrated into core bridge because we also have to pay franchise fees, which is also pulled from there some kind of way. To be quite honest with you, I don't know how that all works together, but I just want to make sure Nothing is a miss.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah. From my understanding with CoreBridge, you're setting out the invoices from CoreBridge and leveraging the other merchant services in that invoice for credit card as an option.
julondajohnson: Correct.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. Then once that's marked in CoreBridge, it just has visibility. What we just need to make sure is that it's synced with QuickBooks. When you update something in QuickBooks manually, Like say you go on your back end in QuickBooks and you update like one transaction or one invoice from within QuickBooks. Does that then show inside CoreBridge?
julondajohnson: So here's how it works. Once they pay through CoreBridge, it shows in CoreBridge and then it shows in QuickBooks.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay.
julondajohnson: We don't have to go to QuickBooks every day to verify whether something's been paid. It shows in our operating system. The moment the customer pays, we're on one screen. Oh, customer is paid. It's in core bridge. Boom, we can get started on their order. My concern here is that it won't show us in core bridge to this payment has been made.
Jacob Greenberg: And it has to show in core bridge because that's how you're checking in with the franchise. Correct. Gotcha. Yeah, I mean, as long as it's a two-way sync with QuickBooks, it should be completely fine and update on its own. But I'm also happy to set up a follow-up call with you and I'll bring a solution specialist in with me and we could review the process a little bit. You could open up CoreBridge and we'll just double check that everything's working. We could do a test transaction. But I'm happy to walk through that process with you as well. Is that something you think would be the best next step for us?
julondajohnson: Definitely for me, yes, absolutely.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, great. So what I'll do now is let's set up a follow-up call. And I will bring on a solutions expert and we'll see if we can walk through this for you. Okay. Let's see. What is your timeline here to get this implemented?
julondajohnson: I am out next week. Can we set up a follow-up call probably October 1st?
Jacob Greenberg: Sounds good to me. So that is a Wednesday. I've got some time. Anytime between 1 and 2 or between 3:30 and 4:30.
julondajohnson: Let's do 1:30 that day.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, great. All right. All right, I'm gonna send out this invite now. Go ahead and accept it for me when you get it. It prevents anyone else from booking on my calendar and when we're a couple weeks out, I never know what's gonna happen.
julondajohnson: Totally understand, we'll do.
Jacob Greenberg: Awesome. All right, great, Jacob. It was great to meet you today. Same.
julondajohnson: Thank you so much for your time.
