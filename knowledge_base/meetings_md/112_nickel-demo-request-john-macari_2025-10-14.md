John Macari: John.
Christian Sheerer: Hello, John. And John. John's doing well, staying busy, so can't complain. Better than sitting around and doing nothing.
John Macari: So.
Christian Sheerer: That'S what we like ourselves at least. How are y'?
John Macari: All? Not bad.
Claudio Wilson: Awesome.
Christian Sheerer: I think Claudio's joining. I think he wanted to. He mentioned that you might have some like higher level technical questions and so he wanted to be on.
Claudio Wilson: Oh, there he is. Hey, how's it going? I think you guys are.
Christian Sheerer: A little bit choppy from. Yeah, you, John. M.
John Macari: Off my video. I'm having some technical issues with my Internet at home. Sounds good. How's that? Is that better?
Claudio Wilson: Yeah, I think so.
John Macari: How. Okay, so. So let's just dive into it so we can get this done. So what we're to do is we have a. We have E Commerce platform that we getting a bunch of other chatter in there.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, John.
John Macari: There we go.
Claudio Wilson: Okay, cool.
John Macari: So we're looking to see if we can use API keys to integrate you into our sales platform for a seamless process. I also want to know, so what, what security measures are in place? And the reason I ask is because we will be doing international transactions after the first of the year. So I don't know if that's possible. Your platform. If not, that's fine. We can keep it as a second option to us only. And if you're. If your guys's sales are. Your guys's processing platform will also do instant conversions for euros and other. And other currencies.
Claudio Wilson: Yes, I can answer first question. Second. So we, we have an API integration in place, but I don't know if it's what you're looking for, because I think you're looking for like an API to create ACH payments or create credit card payments. Is that, is that correct?
John Macari: Yeah. So we wanted to go through our sales platform. When they go to checkout, they can select your payment platform and then it auto directs through API and can process. And can process the payment instead of sending out invoices and. And payment links.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah.
Claudio Wilson: So that is not in the works. So the API that we are developing is an API to create invoices and send out payment links. But we're not, you know, Nickel was built as a AR platform for, for. Not for E Commerce specifically. So that's like not within the realm of things we want to do.
John Macari: Okay.
Claudio Wilson: Frankly, it's. I don't think we're gonna be able to create an API to power E commerce things in the near future.
John Macari: Okay.
Claudio Wilson: So sorry to talk to you about that, but on the international payments part, we are developing international payments for to pay bills, etc. So that is all that is in the works and going into beta around two months from now.
John Macari: Okay. Yeah, because what we really need is we've, you know, we've been doing it kind of old school with sending out invoices, you know, using your platform, but now we're moving over to our own platform that we built out and we need to be able to process sales directly from the sales portal on our platform.
Claudio Wilson: Yeah, then you're probably looking like a stripe innovation or something, right?
John Macari: Yeah, we've had troubles with stripe. That's why I'm talking to you guys.
Claudio Wilson: Yeah, I get it. And that's why nickel exists to a certain extent.
John Macari: Yeah. Okay, well I, I think this meeting can be short if that's not something we can do. Yeah.
Claudio Wilson: Yeah.
John Macari: Okay. All right, well, I appreciate your time for sure. Thanks. Bye.
