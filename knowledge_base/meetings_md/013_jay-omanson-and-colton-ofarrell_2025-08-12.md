Colton O'Farrell: . . . . . Hey Jay, how's it going today? Oh, I cannot hear you at the moment. Can you hear me okay? How about now?
Jay Omanson: Got it, perfect.
Colton O'Farrell: There we go. Awesome. How's it going today, Jay? Good.
Jay Omanson: How are you?
Colton O'Farrell: Not too shabby on this end. Glad you can make time to jump on this call with me today. I know you were looking at Nickel for your speaking analytics incorporated company. Yep. Nice. Yeah.
Jay Omanson: I set up a basic account. I guess, yeah, I really just wanted to kind of talk through functionality, how it really ties to QuickBooks. Yeah. and then just that whole side of invoices and different things. And then also, yeah, there's just a few different kind of questions. Yeah, absolutely. It would be helpful to know what.
Colton O'Farrell: Do you got going on from an accounts receivable, accounts payable perspective today? So it sounds like you're operating on QuickBooks Online.
Jay Omanson: Yeah, purely QuickBooks. We switched from QuickBooks Desktop. I purchased the company a couple months ago. We switched from QuickBooks Desktop from the old seller to me. I moved ARAP, it online. So yeah, all I that. have a And bookkeeper so that we're really just handles trying to make it better. I don't like the fees in QuickBooks. And then I love, like, that's really.
Colton O'Farrell: I saw the fees. Are they doing one to two percent for your invoices or what's the, I.
Jay Omanson: Believe it's one percent on all ACH transactions. And then the credit card ones are three or four. So they're something three or four percent. But yeah, I was intrigued to see your guys' side, also the integration, right? QuickBooks, I mean, QuickBooks doesn't make anything easy as far as bringing in another payment provider besides like, I think some like random one. So yeah, so that's kind of where we're at. We leverage that. We also have an external time tracking tool and then we pull that data in to the invoice level.
Colton O'Farrell: Are you mostly billing one time? Are you doing reoccurring invoices? Are you doing any kind of payment authorization? organization requests. What does that look like to us?
Jay Omanson: So when we do a project, we're usually doing monthly billing. The project will last three to four months, and we bill hours used for the project amount.
Colton O'Farrell: So those values are dynamic and changing on the recurring side? Okay.
Jay Omanson: So we don't have like a set product or anything where they're paying, say, 200 bucks a month or anything like that. we do have a couple where like it's a recurring meaning like once a year. They pay us for a high level thing where we would set it up as like.
Colton O'Farrell: And that's like a static amount where that doesn't change.
Jay Omanson: Usually those ones, but those are far and few between. The basic of what we're doing is like, yeah, it's just general invoicing and it can be anywhere from 100 bucks to 70,000.
Colton O'Farrell: Okay.
Jay Omanson: Per per in a month.
Colton O'Farrell: Got it. So quite a range there. That makes sense. In terms of the amount of invoices you're sending, what does that look like on a monthly basis?
Jay Omanson: Well, every month. So it's probably this year will probably land at like almost 2 million.
Colton O'Farrell: 2 million in revenue. Yeah.
Jay Omanson: And all of that more or less is going through an invoice of sorts. So that's the other side is some of our partners have done like a direct ACH to us, which probably might, which I assume wouldn't really hit Nickel.
Colton O'Farrell: So unless they wanted to say that's usually that, yeah, that's usually them doing it directly from their bank. Yeah. So like wiring you money essentially. So it sounds like you've done some research on Nickel. Is there specific questions you have that you weren't able to find kind of as you're doing your research?
Jay Omanson: Yeah, I'd love to see. So like I know Nickel has its own like invoicing and things like that. The question is, is we're using an external timesheet tool called Paymo.
Colton O'Farrell: Paymo.
Jay Omanson: Paymo pushes into QuickBooks, helps generate the invoice. I saw that you guys have a thing where literally it could take every single invoice there, push to Nickel and push out.
Colton O'Farrell: Yes. Yep.
Jay Omanson: And so I guess the question there.
Colton O'Farrell: Is.
Jay Omanson: Can we get like a whole new template in Nickel? So like we, 'cause like the other side is the invoice. how they look and all that in QuickBooks suck.
Colton O'Farrell: So I'm wondering, it's typically, I'm wondering if Paymo could, you know, get all the information that you need into QuickBooks Online. QuickBooks Online essentially serves as the bridge because we have that native integration with QuickBooks. So we can pick it up from QuickBooks Online and then bring it all into Nickel. We have some different kind of options. You're So pulling what you would in do the on info your side, from so Paymo, that's going to QuickBooks, and then you're generating an invoice based off of that. Yes. You know when there's the button to either save the invoice or review and send?
Jay Omanson: Yep.
Colton O'Farrell: You would just hit simply save, and when you have that connection with QuickBooks, so for us, you just simply go into account settings.
Jay Omanson: It sounds like you set up your account, maybe you've seen a little bit of this. I just did it. I set up the initial account, but.
Colton O'Farrell: I didn't connect it, 'cause I was like, I didn't want anything Here, to potentially let me break. just share I my didn't screen as well. know how, We like- could kind yeah, of yeah, do this no a worries. little bit together. Well, at any point, if you wanna log If into you your can QuickBooks see this okay.
Jay Omanson: I have a account, random, kind of random request too.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, what is it?
Jay Omanson: When I set up my initial.
Colton O'Farrell: I.
Jay Omanson: Think I was moving fast testing a bunch of stuff. I created an account under my Jay@10poundgorilla.com.
Colton O'Farrell: Oh, was it a potential referral or are you looking to change from 10 pound gorilla to the analytics?
Jay Omanson: So, yeah, so 10 pound girl is technically our DBA, our business name. But I think I went in and tried to cancel my nickel account because I was like, oh, we're gonna choose something else. Well, then I came back in my research and it wouldn't let me do anything with that account. And then it just gives me, like, an error. So I don't know if you or tech support could kind of help clear that up.
Colton O'Farrell: I will escalate this to support. Are you able to get into the account still? No.
Jay Omanson: And so I think I click, there's probably, like, a cancel button or.
Colton O'Farrell: Or deactivation maybe?
Jay Omanson: Yes, I'm assuming that's tied to the Jay at 10 pound gorilla. I would love everything to be tied to that instead of this OmansonJ@gmail. Cause that's the other one is my actual corporate email, which I'm like, I saw technically there would be two sites ish. So one is just like, how do I just want one tied to Jay and then that will be what I work out of with that.
Colton O'Farrell: And you don't need. and that's, I mean, because it's, you know, just doing business as they can all be kind of the same account. It's just, you know, for you versus your customers, kind of what they're calling you.
Jay Omanson: Correct. And so we're from like a corporation side where we're speaking analytics incorporated registered in Colorado, but our DBA is 10 pound gorilla. So we would do a mix of both. Like that's where I need to understand, like from the invoice side and yeah, well, I guess you're pulling all that.
Colton O'Farrell: Data from QuickBooks like we have. Yeah.
Jay Omanson: So what you would do there.
Colton O'Farrell: So it would pull in. Yep. through the So account you settings would just go to right here. You'd go to this far tab that says Integrations. It's this green link QuickBooks account button. You'd click on that. That would bring you to your Intuit QuickBooks page. You'd sign in with your login password. You'd select your company chart of accounts. Once you do that, everything then would flow into nickel from an accounts receivable perspective here, as well as with your customers, and then that accounts payable perspective here. Fenders So if that you you're have working with, bills that you need to pay, everything will be pulled directly into Nickel. We do have some automation that you could also turn on when it comes to QuickBooks. So I don't actually have my demo account set up with a QuickBooks account, just showing the purposes that you can connect it. But I do have a screenshot of what it looks like once you've done so. So you would see something similar to this. So it would say, you know, Speaking Analytics Incorporated or 10 pound gorilla, but have There's your QuickBooks this toggable automation number. at the bottom. So what this would do is anytime you generate an invoice in QuickBooks and save it, we would automatically send it to your customer via Nickel, and we'd send that either via SMS or via email. So whatever you add in there, that's where you would just hit the save button on QuickBooks Online versus the review and send. Because if you have this automation turned.
Jay Omanson: On and that your customer would essentially get two invoices.
Colton O'Farrell: And then they're gonna get yes. And Okay. if you have this automation So you just hit turned the on, save once button. you hit that save button, this would send your invoice for you. Where it's not good to have this automation turned on is if you're generating an invoice, and then once you generated it, you have to go through, make modifications, edits, change it, because each time you were to do that, then you would hit save. Exactly, exactly. So if you are having to change invoices a lot, we recommend just having that turned off. What you would do if it was turned off is you Come would simply into Nickel, once you have the integration connected, like I mentioned, everything would flow into Nickel here. You would just come to the far right hand side where it says payment requests. You'd click this request payment button, and we would send this secure payment link right here, either via email or via SMS to your customer. And what I'll do is so you don't ever have to generate invoices directly within Nickel. You can continue just to do that in QuickBooks because I'm not connected to a QuickBooks And I'm also account. gonna send I'm it to just you going just to so show you you could that see you kind can of create that experience from an your, invoice what your directly customers with would the see. Nickel. So it's very simple. I'm just gonna go to customers. Like I mentioned, if it's in QuickBooks, we'll grab all that information, but because I'm not connected, I'm just simply going to grab you. So we're gonna call this, we'll add you as a customer with Speaking Analytics Incorporated. And then is it okay if I do the OmansonJ@gmail.com or should I do.
Jay Omanson: It with the other one?
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, either Awesome. one, yeah. So this is the email that's going to receive the well, you won't get anything here. This is just me adding you as a customer. But when I send that invoice, you'll get that. The only way that your customer would get something on this side when you're setting them up is if you hit this set up payment authorization. And I'm not sure if you're doing this much for your customers, but what this would allow is you would set specific criteria. So you could have a transaction limit, a time frame. But what this would do if your customers have completed it, is it would allow you to auto-debit from their account. So you'd just be able to automatically pull from their account. I don't know if you have any of that today that you're doing.
Jay Omanson: My last agency that I purchased or owned, we did that with all of our clients. But this one is pure invoice related.
Colton O'Farrell: Okay. You wouldn't need to do that.
Jay Omanson: I would set that, setting them up.
Colton O'Farrell: And then you would just, instead of clicking on this, you would just simply hit save.
Jay Omanson: Awesome.
Colton O'Farrell: And then so we go to, I'm going to go to invoices here, new invoice. Just grab your name and call this 154. And I believe it is the 12, 12-25. And that typical range was a few hundred to a few, you know, $70,000 it sounds like. So we'll just do, Smaller invoice, just at $1,000 here. We'll have this be one time. And I'll just type a quick memo in here.
Jay Omanson: And if we have terms and stuff in QuickBooks, I'm assuming that's going to pull into here and change like the due date and all these other pieces. Yep.
Colton O'Farrell: So whatever is listed in QuickBooks is.
Jay Omanson: Going to pop up in the same with invoice number.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep. And that, so I'm also going to attach Just a sample file. So this isn't an actual invoice, just one I grabbed from the internet. But shows you that you can... what it comes through as. Yeah, so you can see, so I'm attaching this just as a simple invoice, but it's going to be renamed as whatever the invoice number or purpose is. So that will change the name of. This when I send it via email. Oops, as soon as possible. And I'll just put demo so you don't forget that this is not a real invoice because I've had some customers who've done that, but also delete it on my end and everything once you're But complete. we're simply going to hit create there. Going to send that via email. If you were curious of what it looked like before sending to your customer, you can also copy and paste that link into a new browser. I'll do that while we're waiting for that invoice to hit your box, but it should just be a moment. But this is what you'll see here. So I'll say your name, your email, the branded logo, invoice name or number. There's a memo there, invoices attached, and then the two options for your customer to pay. So if they want to pay via their bank they would and simply ACH, have to add there's their routing no and account fee whatsoever numbers there for and you pay. or any of your If customers. they do want to pay with a credit card, either for 45 day float or credit card points, they can do that. There is a 2.99% fee that the customer will pay. This fee is like the so it is always 2.99% and by default 100% of that cost is to be paid for by your customer. But you actually have full control over how that's divided up. Yeah, if you have an agreement with all of your customers that you want to split it 50/50, you could do that. If you want to do 25/75, 75 fully eat the costs. You have complete control. This is a global rule right here. But when we come into an individual invoice level, so this is one we have not sent off yet, I can go into settings here and I can, so this is turned on, I can change this.
Jay Omanson: We can customize the individual.
Colton O'Farrell: You can override just this. This will override the global settings just for this individual invoice. So I'll go ahead and do that as well, just so you can see what that looks like. If you also wanted to disable credit card and only have ECH for this invoice, you could do that as well. That would remove any of the fees, obviously. But I'm just going to do this as an example.
Jay Omanson: And how can I also remove the credit card?
Colton O'Farrell: Not on a global level. It's only individually on invoice levels. But so we're just going to go ahead. I'm going to go ahead and send this so you can see just what that change would look like. It looks like you got this on your side as well.
Jay Omanson: Yep. It popped it open. Perfect. Yeah, it gives me a pay now link. Gives me a PDF. So I guess the question is, is do I, it auto generates that PDF, like you'd attached it there.
Colton O'Farrell: And it's gonna automatically grab any of your attachments from QuickBooks. For me, because I'm not attached, I'm not actually connected to QuickBooks. I simply just grabbed a sample invoice, but our system, even with that, was smart enough to know to change it to the invoice number. Perfect. Okay. But we will grab Connected. your specific I think QuickBooks we had this connected at one point invoice, in time. and So you'll we do have also a couple, see, you'll because I'm have like a QuickBooks not, I'm logo not.
Jay Omanson: For the one that truly come over.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, exactly. And the nice thing is too, if your customer, let's see, they hit that, the reply, if they hit the reply now button on there, you'll automatically be CC'd on any communication invoices right there for them to download. So what I'm also going to do, so the pay now button, you know, you clicked on that, you had seen that, how that would all work. What I'm gonna do as well is to show you, so I'm gonna go into the invoice I just sent you. I'm gonna just go ahead and delete that. You're not gonna get a notification that this has been deleted, but once it's deleted, I want you to go ahead and click, like try clicking that pay now button again. And you will see that it's not gonna bring you to the page that we just showed you. It's gonna instead bring you to this payments portal, and that was kind of the next aspect that I wanted to show you. so every customer, in addition to the secure payment links we're sending that are tied to individual invoices, we set you up with your own merchant payment portal so that can be found right here. Most of our customers will take this and they will embed it in their own website. It's completely customizable, so you can come right into settings. There's a, you know, change your information here, add your branded logo, change the banner background.
Jay Omanson: One question on this is so we'll say a customer comes in I guess. Okay, so it's next step. So say I put in a thousand reason for payment when I go to do make payment, that's what I'm going to put in my business information. Like say they're paying a one-off random invoice or some other thing. There's no way for them to really attach it.
Colton O'Farrell: Not currently. This essentially was created more as a backup option for our customers when the primary method's not working, but we are seeing a lot of excitement about this. And so we're adding some new functionality in terms of attachments. They'll be able to see like a history of payments that were made. I believe that's going to be rolling out this quarter. But right now, essentially, this will just.
Jay Omanson: Serve as most come on, make a payment, and then I would be able to go in who made the payment. And technically, if yeah, whatever they put.
Colton O'Farrell: For reason for payment is like the descriptor. Exactly. Yeah. Or if there's something where like that individual invoice link wasn't working, but they know they need to pay you Yes, a hundred and bucks, just specifically they can make just pop that payment into your website right there in there.
Jay Omanson: For you.
Colton O'Farrell: So not all of our customers use it. A lot of them do though. Like I mentioned, it's completely customizable. So everything I've walked you through today, that is all available within the Nickel Core plan. However, there are some limitations for this, and I wanted to call them out just given kind of the size of business you're doing. So what you have currently set up is the Nickel Core plan. So that's what all of our customers get set up when they get started. that is the completely free plan. However, there are some limitations. Those being you can only have three active users on the account. You only can do $25,000 per ACH transaction. So that's not cumulative, meaning you could do 100 of those. You just cannot do one at $26,000 with the free plan. You also get access to that customer payment portal I just showed you. And then the whole workflow of pulling everything into QuickBooks, sending to your customer via email, them completing the payment either via card or via their bank. The ACH processing time, we're still required to get payments in before the 4:00 p.m. Cutoff time, Eastern Standard Time, with our bank partner. But once that's completed, you're generally seeing a two to three day turnaround time for the ACH to hit your account. So everything I described on the free plan, that's also included with the Nickel Plus. and we remove some of the limitations. So this is our most popular plan. It's either $45 monthly or $35 a month billed one time at $420. We give all customers a 14 day free trial of Nickel Plus. You can simply go into the account settings, go to plans and upgrade yourself and kind of self serve if it's what is kind of the model that fit your business. What this is going to do is we're going to remove the active user limit so you can have as many users as you'd like. We also remove the $25,000 cap, so we bump up that cap to just under a million dollars per transaction. So again, not cumulative, you could do as many of those as you need. You just can't go over that rate. You can also schedule payments in advance, you can do recurring payments in advance, and we can also auto-debit your customers. So when I was, you know, kind of explaining that feature of when you're setting up a customer. Right, so those are all only plus features. Given the size of your invoices, if you're having a lot of them that are going to be over that $25,000 amount, we probably recommend the Nickel Plus account. We do have some customers who can break up, like say a $58,000 invoice into two payments to make that cutoff. If that works for you, you're able to do that as well. There's no hidden fees, no transaction charges. ACH is always free. What you see here, the only way that you'd be paying anything in additional to the subscription charge is if you come into settings and you change that surcharge for your customers where you want to eat some of the credit card surcharge or if you go to bill pay and you come in here to pay bills. So if we went to, I'm just going to do a grab like this test bill right here. So I'm going to make a payment. If you were to use a credit card, that's again where you'd see that 2.9% fee on the accounts payable side. But that's the only way that you'd be paying any bills. If you were to use your bank account, there would be no fees on that side.
Jay Omanson: And then for bills and all that, I saw there's also like if for some reason it needed to do a paper check, it was like a $2 fee.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep, yep.
Jay Omanson: On the other list as well for like the functionality and features, like I saw that it said like something for deposits for checks. Yes, so yeah, walk me through that.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, of course. So we can send checks to your customers. So with that payment authorization form, so I have an example of kind of what that would look like. That's where the checks would come in. So that's on the vendor side. So this would be, for example, I sent you that email, I click that set up payment authorization, your customer would get an email that looks like this. We have some frequently asked questions with answers there, but if that was too long and they didn't read all that, we do have it on the next page here. So kind of letting them know that this is the process.
Jay Omanson: They're buying into it.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, exactly. And let them know that, you know, this is Nickel all the is money the is moved process. through FDIC insured accounts or SOC 2 compliance or protecting all their information. If there's ever a credit card like surcharge fee there like there would be with this example, we would be handling the PCI compliance so you would only get that net amount. But this is letting them know kind of all that information, letting them know that they can revoke this authorization, change it at any time, what payment methods are accepted so they can either use ACH for free or credit or debit cards. they would just go to get started. If there was a transaction limit, an expiration date in here, it would say like $25,000 expires in a year. For my example, I just, I didn't do that, but they would simply select those, how they would like to pay. So if they're going to pay via their bank, they just have to add their information in there. And then there would be an option for, oh, this is on the payment authorization side, I guess on the on the vendor side. So if you're setting up a vendor, they could ask, they could say that they want it to be added to their bank via ACH, or they would list their address and say they want a mailed check for $2. And that was the option there. So I can set you up as a pretend vendor if you want to see what that looks like.
Jay Omanson: Yeah, no, no, it's all clear. Yeah, so like, yeah, I get, yeah, but I just wanted to make sure I understood those two different scenarios.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, and that's more on the vendor side. So are you also planning on using Nickel for the accounts payable side as well? Or is it more on the- you- don't have a ton.
Jay Omanson: That's the side. It's like most, almost, well, yeah, and most of ours, I'm just in the platform, we're paying for a lot of platforms or tools or things like that. We don't have a lot of physical vendors because we're not asset heavy or anything. So everything usually just me setting up the credit card directly with them. Or I, yeah, I guess that's the, I do, yeah, I do have a couple vendors, I guess like 1099 employees. There's a two and we have a couple more. So I guess would that be part of this full vendor setup?
Colton O'Farrell: Yes, yes. So we, we have plenty of customers who pay their 1099 employees and contractors via Nickel. We're also rolling out some new updates in terms of kind of tax preparation. forms and documents that will be live before this next tax season. So there will be a lot right now. We have a, you know, we can support the 1099 contractors. You can pay them out via nickel. I actually, you know, a lot of our, like, employees get paid via nickel as well. So it would just simply, you'd add them as a vendor. They would add their bank information, or if they want to get the check, they would add their address, and then it would, there's a two dollar fee for checks, but there's no cost the when ACH, it comes to but they would simply add their information. You just come in here, you could go to bills, do new bill, find your vendor, cold software. I'll do 10 bucks here, make a payment. And I see, I don't have, I haven't actually set up a delivery method for myself.
Jay Omanson: That would be auto selected or I would select whatever they have established. Right there.
Colton O'Farrell: It wouldn't let you make the payment until we either have a bank information or we have an address to be able to submit that. But you can see that credit card that's going to be processed same day, you'll always get a timeline if you do have bills that you're looking to pay with us. And then if we switch to our bank account there, just going to be that one business day there for the, for the bill pay side.
Jay Omanson: Okay, awesome. Yeah, I know that helps.
Colton O'Farrell: Cool. Jay, is there any other areas, questions that you haven't seen that you were looking to get some more information on? I do have some resources I'll send you after this call. So I do have our Security and payment data privacy information here. So like I mentioned a little bit of this before, but yes, like I mentioned, we're FDIC insured. FDIC insured accounts is always what your money is being moved through. So it's always your money. We're simply the processor. We're taking it from your customer, getting it into your account or vice versa. We are handling all the PCI compliance aspects. We are SOC 2 compliant. We're protecting you and all of your customers information. and then those secured payment links that we're sending to your customers, they're all protected with encryption and tokenization. But I'll send you the link to this. I'll send you the pricing page as well as like just a kind of recap demo of what we walk through as well as our G2 nickel reviews. If you're curious on reading from some of other customers, what their experience is with nickel. But is there anything else that I can help just with clarification for you? I know we have to obviously escalate kind of with support just to get the check.
Jay Omanson: I think that's the only thing. If we can get that other account turned on or completely completely deactivated or whatever. So I could create a net new one, whatever the easiest thing is. And then yeah, I think doing that, the middle tier is definitely what I.
Colton O'Farrell: Was planning on doing. Cool. Yeah, and that should completely cover your.
Jay Omanson: Needs based off what I've heard. Awesome. Yeah, no, that's everything so far. So thanks for walking me through all that stuff. So yeah, absolutely. Yeah, we just truly making sure the.
Colton O'Farrell: QuickBooks integration was that easy. Yeah, no, it is, as easy and it's and simple a native as integration. possible. So we've So you designed always it to will be have, as you can always reach out to me, contact me via email, via phone. But I also wanted to call out, we do have our help center here. So this, we are live people, you're not going to ever be set to robots. We're generally getting on any kind of like tickets or requests for assistance within 30 minutes to an hour is kind of the latest amount of time. But you'd simply come in here, send us a message and you will be connected to our customer success and support team.
Jay Omanson: Awesome.
Colton O'Farrell: Awesome. Well, I owe you an email. I'll send you those resources and I'll send you some directions if we need anything from your end in terms of setting up that new account. Otherwise, maybe our support team might be able to handle that. I just need to dig into it a little bit more to see kind of the issues there. But sounds like this is a solution that could support your business. We can use the Paymo, QuickBooks Online, kind of bridge. to get all the information that you need and you would simply just have to change instead of reviewing and send, you'd simply save that invoice and send it off via Nickel. You have to do it manually if you are going to be adjusting those invoices. So you just come in to the right hand side, click that, hit, you could, to review or to send that off. But if you're not having to adjust the invoices, you can simply turn on that automation that I showed you earlier and that would just automatically send those invoices to Cool. Your customers. Wonderful. Yeah. Thank you.
Jay Omanson: Thanks, Colton.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, it was my pleasure. I owe you an email, like I said, and I'll get on that support request we have, but really excited to support your business. And if any other questions do come.
Jay Omanson: Up, just let me know.
Colton O'Farrell: Okay, sure will.
Jay Omanson: Thank you.
Colton O'Farrell: My pleasure. Have a great one, Jay. You too. Bye. Bye.
