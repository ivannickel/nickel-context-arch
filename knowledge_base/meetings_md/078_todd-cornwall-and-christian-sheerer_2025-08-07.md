Participant 1: Good, good. Doing well, staying busy. Better than sitting around doing nothing, though, so I can't complain.
Todd: Too sure about that, but I think I agree.
Participant 1: That's usually the response I get. Well, I mean, let's get into it. I mean, we have 30 minutes. That's still okay with you till the half hour?
Todd: That's good.
Participant 1: Awesome. And I guess get me started on kind of how you found out about us, like what your payment systems look like now and what you think initially we could help out with.
Todd: Well, I found your guest purchase by searching Google search, I guess.
Participant 2: Yeah.
Todd: Currently, I am using Zoho, some type of Zoho builds or something of that nature.
Participant 2: Yeah.
Todd: You familiar with Zoho?
Participant 1: Yeah, I am. I used to work in the HRAS space, like HR information systems, and so I'm familiar with Zoho in that sphere. I know they try to sort of do everything.
Participant 2: Right.
Participant 1: And so I haven't actually, haven't heard of them in the payments context.
Todd: Yeah, they've been around for quite a lot. Zoho books.
Participant 1: Yep.
Todd: Zoho subscriptions. Zoho subscriptions, which is. which is now called Zoho Builds, which does subscriptions and ACH and so on like that. So I've been using them. So basically what I'm kind of trying to find out, and I guess I open up an account and then I close your account because I didn't see in there. Maybe I didn't look close enough, but I want to know how you do ongoing automated ACH payments to my clients. I don't want them manually doing it. I want to, if they do it once manually, no problem. Then after that, it's set up great. Or a lot of time when we get new clients, fact 90, because 900, 100 of the time, they fill out an ACH form or credit card form for us, whichever one they choose. So credit cards I have no problem with. ACH now to have recurring ACH automated payments. And I don't mean an invoice that goes out to them automatically every month and then they pay it. I'm talking about automated ACH payments.
Participant 1: Where you're linked up to them, you have some debit authorization that they agree to in your pull out. on that recurring basis. Awesome. And so you take usually by ACH and card?
Todd: Correct, both.
Participant 1: And what are those usually on a monthly basis coming in? At it up?
Todd: Highest amount, the highest amount is $2,500 a month. The middle kind of an average amount is 1500 and then the lowest amount is about 799.
Participant 2: Cool.
Participant 1: 799 to 2500 and on a monthly basis is that, I guess, what's the volume?
Todd: Yeah, 10,000. Well, you know, customers come and go, but let's just say $10,000 a month, maybe.
Participant 1: 10,000 a month.
Todd: Cool.
Participant 1: What is the nature of the business?
Todd: We're brokers, sales people, sales marketing. So let's assume you have a product. We do it with natural products, food, organic foods and so on. But let's pretend it's your glasses that you have on your face. You want to sell those glasses. You want to sell them, how do you sell them, how do you get them into Walmart, how do you get them to where we go? We're brokers, we're the middle people. So we make that connection for you and we get a commission and a monthly retainer. And that's the part that we need is the monthly retainer taken care of.
Participant 1: And those commissions, how do you handle those payments out?
Todd: We just send out an invoice to them and they pay us either, again, credit card or ACH to sub to them. So so far, so what I've told you about is the, is the.
Participant 2: The.
Todd: 10,000 is the, Retainer. Retainer portion. Correct. So depending upon what's going on, the commissions could be much higher than the retainers.
Participant 2: Yeah.
Participant 1: What's wrong with Zoho bills?
Todd: Nothing is wrong with Zoho bills. in terms of the credit card portion of it. But their ACH portion, one of the things that they require is that when you put in the customer's information, the bank information, then it gives, you know, you don't want it gives you that, puts that penny into the customer's account to verify the account, like it puts a penny in. It's hit and miss. 50% of the customers say they never receive it. So you go back and forth, back and forth with Zoho and they say, well, no, it's supposed to go, they're supposed to receive it, they're supposed to receive it. Customer says they don't receive it. So it's kind of a hit and miss.
Participant 1: And those commissions are always paid out on Zoho bills as well.
Todd: Yes, we use Zoho Books to do the commissions. They kind of connect to it's really, any invoice you put in Zoho Bills or Zoho Invoices, they show in either or. It's really, it's just really connected. So if you do any type of invoicing Zoho Books, which is what our accountant does, if I log into Zoho Bills, the subscription for it, you see the invoice is there, but I kind of have them separated.
Participant 1: Yeah and then do you know do you know how much on the on the on the credit card you guys are paying to to them about the.
Todd: Same thing you have 2.95 2.99 something like that plus 30 cents plus 30.
Participant 1: Cents okay so we we we can wipe that 30 cents off the map the ach is there a fee associated.
Participant 2: With them.
Todd: I think it's 80 cents no matter how big the transaction is.
Participant 1: Okay, cool. That'll go away too.
Participant 2: So.
Participant 1: Nice to know. And then do you ever pass the fee on to the customer on the credit card side?
Todd: All the time.
Participant 1: All the time. And that's easy to do on Zoho Books. Are you just up charging your bill or is it actually- okay.
Todd: It works better in your system than it does theirs. We just simply add the fee to their bill.
Participant 1: Yeah, nice thing with us is because we're sort of like in the middle of that transaction, we can, and you can set it up to be per client, right? One client you might have an agreement with, they pay 1.5% of it and you pay 1.4, another one you might have, they pay 2.9%, you pay zero, another one, so you can adjust that per client. The short answer on the ACH stuff in terms of automated recurring payments is that you can, with sending out debit authorization form, so you described it in the exact way that we think about it, right? And we're really built for kind of the payments industries, or sorry, industries where payments like of a $25,000 amount is small, right? And so we had to build it this way because people are using us for large construction projects, for example. People are using us in your capacity as well. And they found us as sort of like, you know, the best kept secret because when we realized, okay, these large transactions need to be accounted for in the payments systems writ large, right? We knew we were going to have like a pretty easy way for dealing with customers like yourself who, you know, aren't doing like a $500,000 transaction, but we can still benefit from, free ACH, the recurring setup, as well as the kind of moving that surcharge on the credit card processing fee so that you're not, you know, at risk of, you know, tripping the wires on any surcharging laws in different states, you know, because in some states you can't actually put that 3% on top of your bill. And so we can handle that without you having to upcharge on on the actual amount, which is nice.
Participant 2: So.
Participant 1: This is only me being a Yankee and just hearing Zoho and your accent. Do you guys do, is everything in the US?
Todd: I'm from England. I've been in the US for 40 years.
Participant 1: No, I'm just asking just because there's another dynamic if money's moving abroad. and so money for visions of health is, is, is customers are in the U.S. everything's contained.
Participant 2: Right. Cool.
Todd: The only time, the only customer, customer, when we don't have that right now, but we do have them often come, come and go. And it's against two percent of our clientele is Canada. Cool. Cool.
Participant 2: Yeah.
Participant 1: And we're building out International payments as we, as we go. And so Canada is obviously the first one that every payment system when they go International.
Participant 2: Thinks about.
Participant 1: And so we should be good there and not too much to dive into now. Awesome. Okay. Before I get into the platform, which is nice because it's super simple. If you've played around with it, I'm curious what led you to sign up and then deactivate.
Todd: I didn't see what I told you, the recurring ACH.
Participant 1: Okay, cool. It might be because you were on core. So plus opens that up. And so you can set up a recurring invoice for Colton, monthly, etc. If you are going to this guy, for example, A&R Wholesale, you can see all the past transactions, but I can also add a customer payment method by sending this request. that I can then link up to that recurring payment. So I'll send out a full debit authorization form, and I'll send it to myself. So I'll show you what it looks like. Right, full permission lets you charge a customer's account without transaction limits or expiration. So, or you could set it up based on your relationship with them. Maybe for those retainers, right? You just have, here's the max retainer that you're going to have, but if there's a commission that you need to pull automatically, is that something that you would ever do?
Todd: We say automatically, what do you mean?
Participant 1: So in your framework, right? Like you want to do this recurring pullout, that's only for retainers. That's not for a commission would be, submitting a specific invoice for that commission amount.
Todd: Right. There would never be a scenario where you get recurring commissions every month, but they differ.
Participant 1: Okay, cool. So then, yeah, in this sense, right? So I'm trying to just piece those things together. There's a couple of options that you could, right? It's like one, you have the full permission and you don't have a limit so that you can change that recurring amount before it's set to be debited from their account to have the retainer plus commission. Or I think what's a little bit more specific for you is I think where we're getting at and what you're thinking of is like, hey, let's just do the max amount as the retainer amount that Todd and customer have agreed upon, and then factor in the commission later down the line with a separate invoice.
Todd: Correct. Cool.
Participant 1: Awesome. So yeah, I'm going to send this to myself. And then I'll open it up in a separate screen. And then you can also for this particular person, set the logic of.
Participant 2: What.
Participant 1: The credit card split is going to be. Cool. So I got the request here. And this is what they'll see. So I'm a client of yours.
Participant 2: Okay.
Participant 1: Wanting to see the payment method on file, complete the form, and then it walks me through. all these things. Gives them a good breakdown of our security principles and certifications that we've had, what they can do to cancel and revoke, what payment methods are accepted, etc. and then how they, what information they want to keep on file. And then that will remember that until they change it. Is that what you're looking for?
Todd: I know. No, it's just, tell me the process. Now that they fill that out, how is money taken? What is it? So, time comes for payment now, is it just deducts it automatically every month?
Participant 1: So yeah, so if you set up recurring, right? So I'll go in and I'll set up a new invoice for A&R.
Todd: Okay.
Participant 1: Whatever. Invoice amount 1. Oh, sorry, I skipped it. Create an invoice for that person, recurring retainer. Retainer, and then I'll make it recurring. And so make the end date. How do you guys do it on a yearly basis?
Todd: We just set it as never ending. Maybe you don't have that choice. So put it as you have never ending.
Participant 1: Okay.
Participant 2: Yeah.
Participant 1: I don't know if we have it on never ending.
Todd: That's fine. That's fine.
Participant 1: Put it far into the future and use it monthly, right? So every month. You know, honestly, it's a good note, right? To note on the never ending bit just on our end, right? That's something that we would want to make either an automated notification to you guys. I'm just spitballing for something that would be very easy fix for our development team to be like, hey, I just walk over there and be like, hey, either we make it never ending or provide that option or have like an automatic notification of like, you know, December 2026 or in November, you know, notify you and your customer, this is set to or probably notify you, this is set to end like re up on the retainer. And then you could upload a document, right? The maybe you have some MSA with them that is tied to this recurring amount. create it, and then you're either charging them, right, from the payment method you have on file with that authorization form. And you could always tie each payment to a specific link.
Todd: How are we charging them? How are we charging them? Now, let's say we have the ACH payment on file. It's not when you say charge them, what happens when you charge the customer? Does it charge them by sending them an invoice for them to pay or is it just charging them and then sending them a receipt?
Participant 1: No, it's going to charge them and send them a receipt if you are not, if they don't. So, I mean, sounds like all your customers are just ready to go and give you debit authorization to just completely just pull. Right.
Todd: Cool.
Participant 1: Awesome. So that'll be the way. I'm just showing you this would be another situation where it's sending them like an invoice particular to a link. And so you might use that for commission, for example, right? That's like an easy way to build in the commission stuff. But this is for that recurring retainer. You've titled it. This is the 799 to 2500. But yeah, they've added their payment information. When I send a secure payment link, right? That's for those one-off or those, you know, bigger transactions wherein customer logs in, they might have, you just envision yourself, you're adding up a bunch of other customers and, you know, they log in, it's for a particular invoice. So two different ways of doing it. one in the current state of what you're doing, and then two, if you're adding on those commissions being processed through Nickel.
Todd: And if you don't do an automated charge, let's just say, for example.
Participant 1: You.
Todd: Have all of their payment information in there, and you just want to do an auto charge monthly, but you're doing it manually based upon the information that they've given you without having to without having it do an old auto. If you're just billing them, if we have ACH without doing having the auto piece involved.
Participant 1: I'm not, I don't know if I'm following.
Todd: So, okay, so you're going to pay us a retainer $2,500.
Participant 2: Yeah.
Todd: For whatever reason, we're not going to put you on auto charge in the sense of it's just going to charge you automatically every month.
Participant 1: We're not doing that. Okay, I got you.
Todd: But we're going to charge you. I'm going to charge you every month without sending you an invoice, just sending you a receipt, but I'm going to charge you. Is that doable? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Participant 1: That's the process that we just walked through. So for example, so we just changed this ANR wholesale, right, to this recurring one as request payment, send the link if it hasn't been paid already. You can send reminders.
Todd: Etc. Right, but that's you sending them a link for them to pay. I'm talking about me charging them without doing that.
Participant 2: Yeah.
Participant 1: And you would just click here and charge the payment method on file once they've given you the payment method.
Participant 2: Yeah.
Todd: Okay. Okay. So then, so because currently, right, how we do basically, They sign a contract with us. Once the contract is signed, we send them a form to choose whether they want to do ACH or credit card. They fill out, let's just use ACH. And they fill out the ACH information, gives all of the information. And then what we do, we go into Zoho, we add that information to Zoho, and then we just simply turn on the retainer. We can charge the client. it sends them a receipt every time that they're charged. So what you showed me here was that you were basically putting a new customer, it would send them an information where they have to kind of agree and sign up again. So does that eliminate, are we saying that we have to do it twice then? If they fill out our information that we send them, manually and they filled it out, do we then now with your system have to resend another ACH authorization form?
Participant 1: Yeah, because how else would we get their information? Unless you want you, if you wanted.
Todd: To, you've given it to us already. Oh, I'm gonna put it in manually.
Participant 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Todd: In your system.
Participant 1: Yeah, yeah, I hear you. I mean, this is something I, because it's interesting because you already have it.
Participant 2: Right.
Participant 1: And you have, I just don't know. That's something that I think I would need to take away to our team because you already have it, right? And you're like, but I don't think that we can, compliantly debit because we're also, we're involved in the transaction, right? Like we're compliantly, we're trying to debit them as nickel and then passing that money to you. I don't know if we can't, if we, if we can do that with just Todd saying, hey, yeah, we have all their information. It's cool. They've never interacted with nickel before and we're just going to pull funds. Does that make sense? You see why there's sort of like a, something in my head that's like, okay, wait, we probably have to have them go through that authorization form. And then you explain to them part of this process of switching in the billing, why it's beneficial to be using Nickel versus Zoho or...
Todd: I don't see an issue, to be honest with you, using your ACH authorization form instead of ours. Except the only issue is we like to keep the client's information on hand, especially if we're changing systems. Let's just say for whatever reason, Nickel decides they're closing down or whatever, you don't like us no more, we don't like you no more, and we've given you 40 clients and we've already collected their credit card information, we've already collected their ACH information to go back. And then, because I'm sure the information that, or maybe you can correct me, When they fill out the ACH information from your system, are we privy to all of that information?
Participant 1: You'll be privy to account routing number, the stuff that will allow you to bill. What's that?
Todd: We can't add any fields to that.
Participant 1: What fields would you add?
Todd: Who knows? Their email, we put, we put, you know, text that says that, you know, you agree to so and so, whatever. I don't know. We just, we just normally, we normally use like a, you know, a jot form or whatever it is, WordPress form or whatever it is for my website. And we put in kind of the details that we want, and then they fill it up and we make sure that they've signed up a million places that, so we, so we cover ourselves in every single way. Again, I have not, we have no problem. using your form. It's just that what we've what we've experienced over the years is it I mean, I know it sound funny Li like, uh, you know, like what are you what are you trying to? Rip for your custom business?, no, no.
Participant 1: No, no, no, I just I I just I think this is actually a lot less, uh, a lot less. I think we're talking about two different things. I was just I thought your, uh, hesitation was getting them to fill out the Authorsation form again.
Todd: Whi no, no, no, no, ye No.
Participant 1: No, it's just like, are you still privy to the information to be able to keep your customers on? Yeah, so you'll have their contacts associated with your customer. You'll have whether, so what else would you add on there?
Todd: I'd have to go back and look, for example, but I know, for example, if we just simply send them an authorization form from Zoho, yeah. To fill out for credit card or ACH, they would fill it out and it works perfectly. But if, if, if, if we decided to move from Zoho, we wouldn't have that information because Zoho doesn't share it. It's only, there's only a portion, like the last four digits of the credit card number and so on and so on. So what we found over the years, because what we, who was we with a long time ago? We was with Authorized.net.
Participant 1: Yeah, heard of them.
Todd: Ton of customers, ton of customers. Oh, was it Stripe? And we said, okay, we've got, you know, the rates were too high, blah, blah, blah. We were going to move over to this guy. And we had all these customers. And to go back and say to the customers, Hey, by the way, we're women. Can you please get re-read your information? What happens is this, I'm sure you know. Right, 5% say, oh, I forgot I was paying you. I forgot I was paying you. Let's end this now. All right. Or the other one, what we find out is that we do a lot of business with a lot of clients, right? And they pay, they don't have no issue paying, but as soon as you remind them, as soon as you remind them, oh. Oh, you're paying us. You're paying us 25,000 different models. Oh, wait a minute. You know, they start thinking. So this is what we try to do. We try to, like, we don't. They don't mind getting a receipt, but this is what I've noticed. But whenever you start hitting them at an invoice every single month.
Participant 1: Yeah, I got you. Okay, let me do this. Let me just. Because I don't have the answer on top of my head of, like, apart from in the platform, like what you can see as it relates to a customer. No, I got you, though. No, no, no. I just want to be fair.
Todd: It's not a big deal. Because the reason I'm saying it's not a big deal is because part of our process is the accounts department sends forms out another set of separate forms where they have to fill out anyway.
Participant 2: Yeah.
Todd: You know, which, which, which, which has ACH and everything else and everything else in there, so. We get them information one way or the other. I was just kind of curious about your system. It's not a big deal. That would not be a deciding factor on our part. But I was just curious because, and.
Participant 1: Yeah, and I mean, I'm the same way as you. I wanna satisfy all my curiosities in any way that could be interpreted. But also because, Like full transparency. I started working here a couple months ago. And so like I, as a person who's on the sales team, right? I just want to know the full breadth of like possibilities of the ways that clients can interact with us and what that means for when they, because it's, I think we have an attractive platform. It's very simple. It's easy to use, right? But it's less exciting to me to be like, oh yeah, we're gonna save you a bunch of money on the ACH and the credit card and like that should be enough for you to sign up. It's more like, okay, Right, which let's are don't think about all immediately of these other time translate based into things. money, but at the end of the month you say, oh, I spent five hours trying to transition, right? Is that worth it for me? So that's sort of what I want to, you know, help think through because that is gonna help me think through it for, you know, the thousands other people that I'm gonna be able to speak to. So let me do that. Let me take that away as homework in terms of like, okay, what all through the authorization Is Todd able to see and able to store as information? Because also, you're going to have to also link that back up to Zoho Books. And then two is we'll have that recurring retainer, which seems simple enough. And then I can help you sketch out as you're starting to use the platform, and this is what my typical process is. get people on the platform playing around with a couple of these transactions. And then in about a week's time or whenever they have their next batch of transactions to be processed, we get back together and we say, okay, here's how we do the recurring, here's how we do the commission. And if there are any things that we need to troubleshoot and you guys want to sort of act as part of like a design partner, things like that we should add in like that long term never ending recurring retainer, et cetera. We can have that conversation then. And then also selfishly, it's right, it's like, and good for you because we have a $250 referral bonus. If there's any things that you, any people in your network that you think, okay, cool. This is somebody that would also benefit from using Nicole. We'd like to have that conversation.
Todd: Okay. I think what I might try and do, I'll go over it with Andrew. She has, she handles accounts. but what I. What I probably would do. Give me one second, would you?
Participant 2: Yeah. Yeah.
Todd: Hey, Michael. Michael, call you back. I'm gonna call. I'll call you back. I I saw. I saw the email and I was gonna call you, so give me. I'm gonna.
Participant 2: Give me.
Todd: Give me 10 minutes. I'll call you back. Thanks. What I'll do, I'll probably. I want to test it with one live customer and just make sure everything is copacetic and just get a good feel for it. Again, we're very cautious in terms of moving things like this and moving clients from one to the next.
Participant 1: Yeah, you should be.
Todd: So just go, if you could go back in the system again for me for a second.
Participant 2: Yeah.
Participant 1: 1 sec. Here we go.
Participant 2: Cool.
Todd: So right now, if I understand it correctly, I am on this free account. Obviously, we'd probably be, yeah, we definitely would be moving to the paid version, right? But let's just look at the free account that we have right now. So I'm going to do a client, I think I could do a test client. Yeah, I'm going to do, let's say, $2,500. test client and I'm going to send them an authorization form. Take me from start to go. Where, where, where I get, they fill out the authorization form, then I can build that client. Doesn't have to be. Can I just to be, just to be clear, once the, if the client is being billed by me with the authorization, once I have the authorization form, I can move that client. to a recurring payment at any time? Or does that have to be another authorization form?
Participant 1: No, you can move it to recurring.
Todd: Without having them do permissions and everything else again.
Participant 1: Yeah, if they've given you the payment authorization.
Todd: Okay, good. So they've had the call through, so take me from start to finish, sending the authorization format to them.
Participant 1: Yeah, so I'll make a new, let me see if I can make a new one. New customer. That's me. Okay, I'll put my email. Cool. Send the payment authorization. If you already have it, you can put it in.
Todd: When you say I already have it, have what?
Participant 1: If you already have their payment details.
Todd: Oh, I can put it in, okay.
Participant 1: Yeah, but there will be another verification process on the phone.
Todd: I understood. Okay.
Participant 1: Okay, so I'm sending it to myself, verify. Sorry, here we go. Full permission, blah, blah, blah. Or limited permission, we'll do it that way. We'll do 2500 max amount, expiration date, no expiration date.
Todd: Why would we do limited permission?
Participant 1: Because if, if they see, because you're only doing it for your retainers, which have a max of 2500. Right. If they say, if you see per transaction, right, I'm just limiting it per transaction to 2500. If you, if I was your client and I would know the max I'm going to pay you is 2500 and you send me a authorization request form for unlimited, no. transaction limit and you bill me for 2600 the next month, I'm gonna lose you. So that's just a safeguard for yourself. You could do it.
Todd: So let me ask a question on that. So this is important things to know because. So let's just say you put it limited 2500 right now, build them 2500. And now they're buying marketing stuff from us in the within the same month. which just happens all the time. They just, they're paying another $4,000 to us. What happens then? Or they're paying commissions that month. What happens then?
Participant 1: Yeah, I would make it higher. Yeah, so, but that's, yeah, that's, so it's per transaction that's billed through this, I already have pre-authorized it, debit, right? If I send another invoice and they pay out against that invoice, that'll be fine.
Todd: So it's per transaction. So in other words, it's not 2500, the max, it's 2500 each time.
Participant 1: Exactly.
Todd: Okay, that's fine. That's fine.
Participant 1: And yeah, and then also, I mean, maybe you add in a little bit of a buffer for yourself. which is like, hey, you know, the max I'm gonna pull is like 7,000 if I, you know, figure out a neat way to bill you for both retainer plus commission.
Todd: No, it's fine. I think the thing they count on prefers to keep the commissions on a separate, separate invoices, not within this, to confuse it with the retainer.
Participant 1: Yeah.
Todd: Okay, that's fine. So as long as you're not saying that that's the maximum we can charge the customer for the month, because there are other additional things we charge them for trade shows and a whole bunch of stuff besides that. But none of those, those are all off door, those are all one-off payments.
Participant 2: Yeah.
Participant 1: And here's another thing you get. So that totally sorted, totally sorted. Another thing you can get with, and I'll show you an example, another thing you can get with Plus is you can have, this is one of our customers, we like talking about them. you can have a payment portal that's like trade show and that's an individual. What's it called? Individual invoice. You can set that up too. If you wanted to have it direct on your site, what have you? Yeah. So as the authorization, right? That's the maximum per transaction amount, not per month amount. So maybe add in some buffer or do those transactions differently. And then I'll just complete that payment method form. This is what the customer is going to do. You might have some conversation with them that they have to do it with you live. And then you'll come back and you'll have that customer. Right, so then I'm here. I have the request sent. He hasn't added his payment method, so I can't bill myself, but I can send him one or.
Todd: So if you use that payment portal for a payment, That is equivalent to the authorization form?
Participant 2: No.
Todd: That's just for payment.
Participant 1: That's just for one-off payments. That's like you just have it on your site in the case that somebody needs to pay you an invoice and they don't want to wait for you to send them one. They can just send you money through your site.
Todd: And the authorization form itself, There's no way to just send a link that they click on and they fill out. You have to go through putting in the information first or whatever.
Participant 1: Well, two separate things, right? So like the authorization form is so that they can be debited, right, in the future or whenever. If I send a link, I can always send a link that they never have to fill in any authorization that you won't collect any of their information. I can always send Hey, here's a new invoice to Christian Sheerer. We're going to do a trade show and I'm going to invoice you a dollar and yada yada. And then I send a secure payment link. Or Christian Sheerer has already given me access to debit, has already authorized I could debit, I'll just charge them for a different invoice. Or I'm just sending him the link, send it, and then I'll show you what that looks like on my end as a customer.
Participant 2: Cool.
Todd: I wouldn't want to waste your time on that. I get what you're saying. That's not the road I was going down.
Participant 1: Oh, okay.
Participant 2: Okay.
Participant 1: Yeah, no, no, no. The authorization form has to go through, it has to go through their email. They have to log in, not log in, but they have to open it up and go through the full authorization. Just so we know we're tying it to a specific person.
Todd: So just go back in the back end again, one last time and make sure.
Participant 1: Yeah, yeah. Which one? Where are we looking at?
Todd: Just take me as if we're going to go start from scratch. We're going to build a customer $2,500.
Participant 1: Okay, cool.
Todd: Not recurring. Not recurring. Not recurring.
Participant 1: Not recurring.
Todd: We're going to use the free version first. Okay. Cool.
Participant 1: So I have Cool, I have my customer that I saved, which is myself. And then I say, here's 2500, one time or recurring, but here one time, boom, retainer for July, upload a document if you want, create it, cool. I'm going to send them a secure payment link or I can text it to them. Send it. All right, I sent it off to him. Now I can see the retainer test. I'll see when it's active. I'll see when it's completed. This is you as Todd. I'll see if there's a schedule in the future. I'll see when it's done.
Participant 2: Right.
Participant 1: And then as Christian, I'm Todd's customer.
Todd: Cool.
Participant 1: I got a new payment request for the retainer test. Here's a memo. and I'm going to go in and pay it by card or I'll pay it by my bank. And to be clear.
Todd: So, so you, so when you're sending out the, the ACH permission form, so to speak, you have to do it with a, with a, with, with a, like charging them or you just, you just can't send out the permission. form by itself. It has to be in the context of me saying, you can send the.
Participant 1: Permission form by itself.
Todd: So how do we do that? That's what the part I want to understand.
Participant 1: Yeah. Let me go back.
Todd: And then once they've signed that up, I can go ahead and bill them.
Participant 2: Come.
Todd: Whenever, you know, the end of.
Participant 2: The month or whatever it is. Yeah.
Participant 1: Give me one second. I got logged out.
Participant 2: Cool. Cool.
Participant 1: So I'm setting up a new customer.
Todd: Okay.
Participant 1: We'll do Chris S. Chris S. All right, jeez. this is my email. Set up payment. I'm creating a customer, no invoice, no.
Participant 2: Money.
Participant 1: Set up customer payment method. I want to request limited permission or full permission, whatever. requesting payment information for retainer, set the expiration date, no expiration date, send the request. Simple as that. Now the customer gets that payment authorization request. I got three, so I'm just going to go in. Right, not tied to an invoice. This is just saving the payment method.
Todd: And once they fill that information out, I can then bill them accordingly.
Participant 1: Correct. Right, because now I have two and I have the other two that I made as customers. Once they, I can bill them once they've finished that request.
Todd: And can you add more than one person as a contact? to that particular request?
Participant 1: Yes. Yeah, I can have A&R with Christian and Jacob.
Todd: And the difference between me adding in the information ahead of time manually is that they won't, they won't have to fill that information up when they get the request. In other words, if they've given, if they've already given me all of the ACH information, right, we've already, we've already decided that, you know, I can't just go ahead and say, hey, Todd says I can go ahead and bill everybody I want on the planet. I have the information. I come to your system now. It's okay. I'm requesting information. Your system says either put it in yourself or request. If I say put it in myself, it's still sending out the it's still sending out.
Participant 1: Yeah, we need to do a verification. We need to make sure the bank account's real. We need to. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Todd: No problem. I'm not problem with that. My point is, is when they get that email, is it already filled out or they just repeating the same information again?
Participant 1: No, they, you just need their bank routing number, bank account number, et cetera.
Todd: They, they, they, I put that in already.
Participant 1: Okay.
Todd: I put it in already, right? Yes, it's me. I'm putting information, I put this in. Now the email goes out to them. Do they have to put this information in again?
Participant 1: No, we'll have their routing and account number, but they will go through, they will have to go through this process.
Todd: Oh, I see. So just the, so when I say I'm putting in their information, it's just the routing and account number, nothing else.
Participant 2: Yeah.
Todd: Got it.
Participant 2: Got it. Got it.
Todd: Okay. All right. Let me give it a shot from my end. And if I have any more questions, I'll shoot you an email as I go along.
Participant 1: Yeah, let's do that. And I have some homework on my side. I'll get that to you by the end of the day. Let's set some time for, do you think next week is too quick of a turnaround to see if everything's going smoothly?
Todd: It might be, but we can still set it anyway and see what happens.
Participant 1: Okay. And then if it's not, we can always move it to the next week. And then I just want to make sure we have some time to kind of like troubleshoot anything slash, you know, maybe you think of some people that might be good referrals, earn you quick $250. And then three, if there's any questions about external connections, like Zoho, stuff like that.
Todd: Okay, sure. I mean, I'll think of a bunch of questions I can. I mean, the real test, to be honest with you, is going to be whichever customer I put in, does a transaction work?
Participant 2: Yeah.
Todd: It will.
Participant 1: Yeah, I mean, people process, we just had a 300k transaction get processed while we were on the phone.
Todd: Okay.
Participant 2: Yeah.
Participant 1: So I know stripe.
Todd: If I did that with stripe. If I did that with stripe, if I did 40, 000 transaction, they'd send the police around.
Participant 2: Yeah.
Todd: Make sure we use stripe.
Participant 1: We use, we use stripe too. And it's the same. It's the same because, you know, we have to, because, like, some people that we pay, they only take it through stripe.
Participant 2: Right.
Participant 1: And, like, we pay for zoom or something or, like, pay for some software. And our founder has to go open his phone, open his bank account, open his stripe account to do this, that, that. And so, yeah, I mean, we were built for industries where, like, that is a, that like, is a whole you. cash flow nightmare, right? If I had to stop every time I process a big transaction. So a lot of work and it's like easy, you know, website, right, to manufacture, but like a lot of work on the back end of, you know, all that payments infrastructure. So it's pretty cool product. So yeah, I'll send some time for this. Is the same time usually work for you? Yeah, yeah.
Todd: 12 o'clock is usually a good time, a good day for me. Monday through Friday is usually good. 12 o'clock is usually the time when I'm in the office for a moment.
Participant 1: Awesome. So I'll send it for same time next week. And then I will get you my contact. I mean, I'll send you an email with the stuff that we recap plus just like some next step stuff. And then that homework I gave you and then I'll drop my phone number in there in the case that you, if that might be easier to reach me.
Todd: I appreciate it. I appreciate it. How old is it? A new company, obviously, because you don't.
Participant 1: Have a lot of- yeah, about three or three years old.
Todd: Okay, thinking so.
Participant 2: Yeah. You got.
Todd: I'm sure you're gonna. I'm sure you're gonna be doing it.
Participant 1: But you need to have a lot more video tutorials. Oh, dude. Yeah, I know. I mean, that's. That's part of. That's part of my job.
Todd: So I'm. I'm been in the weeds writing those scripts. I got it.
Participant 1: Yeah. I mean, honestly, yeah, these. These. These conversations are really good for that. Right. Because it's like, oh, I should just be able to show, like, here's And now, how I I send mean, an it authorization might be form. easy Here's to just make how some you AI send video this. Here's to do it. how It's you send just that.
Participant 2: A one Right?
Todd: With Zoho, Like. it's just a one click, one click. You say, Hey, request information. That's it. And it sends them an email. It sends them an email with a link in it, with a link in it, and they click on it and they just start filling out information and that's it. And it just associates the card or the ACH or whatever it is with that particular customer. So they've got a lot of tools over there. But some of the basic things are obvious, like you mentioned, like, you know, saying, hey, I want the customer to pay the fee. No, we actually have to charge, we actually have to upcharge, you know, add additional monies to the retainer or whatever to cover that. So it's a pain in the backside sometimes because you can never get it right 100% right. I don't care how much times you calculate it, it never comes out right. yeah, a couple cents over or a little underneath or whatever, whatever it is.
Participant 2: So.
Todd: But, yeah. And ach is not just Zoho strong. Oh, they. They normally go through third parties. It's new. ACH is new to them. In fact, the whole payment system is new to them. So whole payments is new to Zoho. So they've got the credit card portion down pretty good. But the ach portion of it, they're still working and working at the Kinks. and I just got an email just now as I'm talking to you right here, telling the same customer, I'll tell. I want to. I'll probably test over here first. It's telling me that they still have not received this so-called code that, you know, that, that gets sent to their, the bank that shows the penny that was been, that has, that's gone in there. So, you know, it's, when you, when you sign up new customers, I just don't have the time. I'll be honest with you, it's got to be a smooth, smooth and, you transition, know, a smooth good thing about our process. clients, they leave us. They leave us the hell alone. Once we sign up with us, we do the work. But when I gotta. When I get. When I get. When I got to keep talking to them about invoices and stuff.
Participant 1: Yeah.
Todd: They start thinking, where? Oh, I'm paying you 25 once. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Participant 2: Yeah.
Todd: You've been doing that for five years. Leave me alone. Oh, no, that's not gonna end right now. So, you know, so we. We want the. We. We want the payment process to be. smooth as hell, but I don't even think about it.
Participant 2: Yeah. Right.
Todd: You know, so that's, that's the, the key for us is just to really get it down to, to nitty gritty. But stripe has been, stripe was a nightmare. Authorized.net was good, but they charged too much. Stripe was an absolute nightmare because anytime we had a massive transaction, I mean, it was like World War III went off. and we were with them for like, you know, we were there for like eight years. No issues, no problems. And then as soon as we started making money, you know, it's like, what? You're not supposed to be making money when you see you do the thousand dollar transaction. You're not supposed to be doing 8, 000 and 20, 000 transactions. And it's like, you know, you thought helicopters were going to come over your, over your house, you know, when you did a big transaction with them, then they'll say, oh, we're holding it for five days and seven days. I'm like, you can't. What are you talking about? Eight years we've been with you. We've never had a problem with you. We've never. Yeah, I know, but it's just our procedure. Okay, you know, it's enough. Enough. So we moved to Zoho. Zoho doesn't bother you. But again, there are little things that we would like to change if possible. So your system seems pretty cool. I'll. Again, I'll experiment and hopefully we can get something going with it.
Participant 1: Yeah, absolutely.
Participant 2: And.
Participant 1: Yeah, and we. I'll be here to answer any questions along the way. And I think you should find it pretty simple to set up in the.
Todd: Week and then we'll chat next week. All right.
Participant 1: Appreciate it, buddy.
Todd: Thank you.
Participant 1: All right, Todd.
Participant 2: Nice to meet you. You too. Take care. Yeah, you have a good one.
