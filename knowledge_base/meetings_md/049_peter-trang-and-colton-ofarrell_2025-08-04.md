Peter Trang: .
Colton O'Farrell: Hey Peter, how's it going today?
Peter Trang: Hey Colton, good yourself?
Colton O'Farrell: Doing really well. Did you have a good weekend with your son?
Peter Trang: Yes, thank you.
Colton O'Farrell: Awesome. Do you guys get up to, I know you mentioned you had some trickster stuff and doing some like sword practice?
Peter Trang: Yeah, yeah we did, we did. It was, you know, he had fun so.
Colton O'Farrell: Nice.
Peter Trang: Yeah. So I started creating the accounts and I appreciate you setting that up, getting that accountant firm kind of set up process going. My couple questions. One, because I created the first account, the parent account using my 3T group. We do have a sort of an entity, a DBA using that so-called EIN number. If I created that DBA as one of the entities with that EIN, would that be our issue? Yeah.
Colton O'Farrell: Can you restate that again? So is that for this 3T, the 3T group? It's not like the DBA is what?
Peter Trang: So we have, we have, okay, the 3T group is the parent, right? But within the 3T group, we, it's, there, there's an operational component. Yes. So, but it's still the same sort of EIN tax ID as the parent account. So if I'm creating a new entity using that same EIN, would that be an issue as a new client? Yeah.
Colton O'Farrell: What is the name of that, that division?
Peter Trang: It's called satva. So let me try it right now while we're on the call. Yeah. Yeah. You don't mind? Let me see.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, that'd be good. You know, it's. I. I'm not sure if it's the exact same EIN if it allows, but yeah, it'd be great to see what you're seeing on your end here. I know we got the CM Trucking Group set up, we got high tech staffing.
Peter Trang: Exactly. Let me pull that up right now. And so I'm going to make sure that we all good there. What we open up my. Okay, so the legal business name is 3G Group. but it's doing business as Saba, Wyoming. Yeah, I end is company address. Oh, I guess this should be okay. Let me just finish up.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, I'm curious once you finish this up, I'm just curious what it looks like on my end. as well.
Peter Trang: So. Just stop sharing for a little bit if you don't mind.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep, of course.
Peter Trang: Is it paused right now? I guess I'm assuming.
Colton O'Farrell: I have not been looking, but let me just see if I can.
Peter Trang: The sharing stopped?
Colton O'Farrell: It has not yet, but let me just try getting.
Peter Trang: I'm in the sharing part. Is the sharing...
Colton O'Farrell: It's paused. Yep, paused. Yep, now I can't see you.
Peter Trang: Let me just make sure. Okay, it looks like it's good. Cool.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, let me check on my side now and just make sure. Awesome. Yep, it looks like it was good on my end.
Peter Trang: Okay, perfect. So here's the second question I had, the second problem I'm running into. Okay, this one is a quite a big problem because I have bills that's being created in QuickBooks, right? Mm-. Within those bills, they have attachments.
Colton O'Farrell: And it's not automatically bringing those over?
Peter Trang: Exactly. I don't see the attachment. If you look at the, if I edit this bill, I don't see those attachments.
Colton O'Farrell: Okay. Can you click off this for a moment?
Peter Trang: Okay.
Colton O'Farrell: Just click on the other side.
Peter Trang: Which side?
Colton O'Farrell: Right here. Just keep it on the screen for just a moment.
Peter Trang: Bills.
Colton O'Farrell: Let me just double check quick. One second.
Peter Trang: . All right, interesting.
Colton O'Farrell: So I just reached out to the team just to get some insight on the back end there. And that's for all of them here. None of them have any attachments?
Peter Trang: Yes, none of them have attachments.
Colton O'Farrell: Can you go back to the View in QuickBooks page? So click on any of them.
Peter Trang: Okay. Okay.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, right down there. Yep. Can you go to the attachment and.
Peter Trang: Go to this is not the right. This is not even the right bill. Let me just switch a company movies because it's.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, I think you're on the high tech staffing.
Peter Trang: Let me switch copy. Let me go into okay, I'm shocking. You click back again. Viewing QuickBooks. And then the correct bill now. Yep.
Colton O'Farrell: Can you go ahead and open that up for me?
Peter Trang: Okay, interesting. Let me see. So, I mean, I can work around it to create the building Nickel, but at the same time, Nickel, creating a building Nickel is not that.
Colton O'Farrell: So, I mean, at least at the moment, so what my recommendation would be here, I'm going to talk with our engineering team and see what's going on with why it's not just automatically pulling the attachments. But I mean, with Nickel, you could just simply hit the download button there. Go to the bill, drag and drop it onto the invoice, and it will, that would be like an immediate fix for you. Obviously we're missing the automation component of it, but you are able to attach.
Peter Trang: The. Yeah, I hear you, but that's a lot of bills. Of course, yeah, I got it.
Colton O'Farrell: But if you have some that need to go out immediately while working on this resolution, that would be my recommendation here. But let me just see, I gotta get some information from the engineering team. We have a QuickBooks specific engineer who's really well versed on all of the field mapping and we do have a native integration. So we have a lot of poll there. But you haven't seen it on the accounts receivable side at all for anything?
Peter Trang: Accounts receivable, let me check. Yeah.
Colton O'Farrell: I was curious if it's doing it on the accounts receivable side or if it's just...
Peter Trang: It didn't pull over my clients. I don't know why. So very good, let's see I'm shocking. How come it's going? Summary, check clients. It didn't pull over my.
Colton O'Farrell: I'm wondering if it's because you're not, you've added these clients as.
Peter Trang: An accounting firm. these are my clients. So it's not, so now that I'm in the client itself, I'm not too sure why it's not, I think there's a bug here where it's not seeing the clients of my client. Does that make sense?
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, and I think it's because you're not those, because what you're on right now, it's like we use it Primarily for like the holding company or parent company, but also this is like for accountants. So they're going to add their clients to be able to view and do their bookkeeping. So I'm wondering if we actually set up like create an account for like C and J itself, because right now they're just a client on your end. So I'm just doing some looking in on my side to see if they're like a nickel account.
Peter Trang: So like this, yeah, because I'm an administrator.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep.
Peter Trang: Okay, I hear you. So maybe I have to set up the administrator account. Yeah.
Colton O'Farrell: Do you want to try doing that for those other divisions?
Peter Trang: Yeah, let me try that now. I was hoping to just use one email login. I don't want to log in every single time. Right.
Colton O'Farrell: So you shouldn't have to with this. Let me just get some clarification on the bill pay side for attachments on like a client side. I'm wondering if there's some kind of issue there, but I will get some information from the team.
Peter Trang: Can I use the same email for each client's administrator?
Colton O'Farrell: Yes, you should be able to.
Peter Trang: Let's try this administrator. Let me try doing this. okay, I'm gonna invite this. Let me try to invite this into you as well here. Okay. Okay, maybe. Yeah. Let me see now once I invite. So I should get an email from Nickel?
Colton O'Farrell: Yes, so I would open up your email. It should say you've been invited to as an administrator.
Peter Trang: Okay, there it is. Let me do this now. Join your team and Nickel. Yeah. Now let me try logging out of this and then I will. This is me logging in as CM Trucking as the administrator. Okay. So let me look at the transactions. Bills. Let me look and see the, nope, this didn't get pulled over either. Are you still seeing my screen?
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, I'm wondering, have you tried sending any of these bills to your customer yet?
Peter Trang: Bills? No, because there are payments, payments, right? Right. This is my customer side. This is the, yeah, I'm wondering if.
Colton O'Farrell: You generate like a test invoice in QuickBooks. with QuickBooks and with an attachment and send it to yourself or maybe even as a bill. Just, I'm wondering if it's not showing you like it's not attached on this section, but it's actually attached through QuickBooks.
Peter Trang: So let me share also what this is. So on this one, these are my clients, right? No attachment. There are attachments to these invoices, so there's no attachments here as well. So I'm wondering if it- Wait, there's a file here. Hold on.
Colton O'Farrell: This is exactly.
Peter Trang: Yeah, this one pulls up. Okay, this works. Yep.
Colton O'Farrell: So that's what I was wondering if that was causing the, if it's just not showing you in that upload section because it's saying you can upload an additional file, but it's going to pull in all of your QuickBooks. Let's check some other ones.
Peter Trang: So just to make sure it's grabbing it all from- It's pulling invoices, bills.
Colton O'Farrell: But not Not pulling on the bill pay side, just the see the invoices.
Peter Trang: Is being pulled over. You see? So my question is, is that function available or does that's just a bug?
Colton O'Farrell: Let me double check. It should be automatic on both accounts payable and accounts receivable. So I'm wondering if there is just some kind of bug issue, but I will discuss with the engineering team and report back with what recommendations are, but it's good to see that it's working for the accounts receivable side.
Peter Trang: Yeah. So I need to double check, like I said, I will also, you know, see if it works there, but let me see if I. Okay, now that I join my, the, the CM trucking as If I were. To. Okay, let me log out first and then now log back in as Peter, BT Group. Okay. Because I saved, how do I switch over to. To?
Colton O'Farrell: So I believe right now you're logged in as your CM Trucking company.
Peter Trang: Yes.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep. So you would have to log in with the 3T group and then that's where you would shift to click on CM Trucking as the client within there. And that's how you would switch between the accounts, most likely.
Peter Trang: Yeah. So my question is, okay, so with the calling firms set up, I'm not able to see my clients as CM trucking or as high-tech staffing.
Colton O'Farrell: Can you go to account settings for a moment for me?
Peter Trang: Uh-huh.
Colton O'Farrell: And click members.
Peter Trang: So now that I added myself as Peter@3TGroup.com, can you click on the bottom.
Colton O'Farrell: One for a second, the 3T Group Incorporated? Just click on that for a moment. Does it allow me to do anything? Nothing. Okay. Interesting.
Peter Trang: All right. So now I added myself here, right? Peter@3TGroup.co.com, right, for CM Trucking as an administrator.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep.
Peter Trang: I've also added myself with the same as the high tech staffing entity, but I'm not able to toggle between the two. So it seems that I have to create an account for each one separately.
Colton O'Farrell: That generally is how it works. I just checked, you do have accounts created for each of these different organizations. So they do all have their own Nickel accounts now. you would just have to be managing them through the 3T Group Incorporated with the accountants.
Peter Trang: Yeah, but that one doesn't allow me to do anything on the receivable side. You see, the problem with that is if I go into the, how come it's not, let me see. Okay, if I manage it in as an accountant side, okay, and I jump into my firm's clients. Okay, now it shows up. Okay, let me check this one. All right.
Colton O'Farrell: I was wondering it might have been because, yeah, you didn't have yourself added as the main administrator. And then typically those updates, if you're not seeing them, best thing to do is just log out, re-log back in, and there should be a clean refresh generally.
Peter Trang: Okay. Okay. Now it's good. Now it's good.
Colton O'Farrell: Right now it's just the bill pay attachment.
Peter Trang: Exactly. Exactly. We can get that. I think we're. We should be golden. The one. One caveat I I guess is. Let me see. Let me show you something. Where. Where did I put my. Credit card information.
Colton O'Farrell: Account settings, get paid. Second one to the left. Scroll.
Peter Trang: Yeah, you're here. The only sort of feature request I would love is if we can rename these.
Colton O'Farrell: Renaming the cards?
Peter Trang: Yeah, because they say I have like four or five cards. Difficult to manage it to know which card. if I can rename it to, to the certain, maybe like a nickname. Yep.
Colton O'Farrell: Does it not give you a nickname option when you go to add payment method?
Peter Trang: No. So if you add cart, there's just a name. There's no.
Colton O'Farrell: Okay.
Peter Trang: Name. Yeah. Cool. Yeah. Let me.
Colton O'Farrell: That should be a pretty easy implementation that.
Peter Trang: Yeah, I suggest if, you know, a feature requested to have a nickname, that that'd be really. That's a great. Yeah. Absolutely. Even for, even for bank accounts. Right. Maybe you have multiple bank accounts that you pull want to make from.
Colton O'Farrell: Sure you know Yep, which one you want to. those are awesome requests. I'm going to put them right now in our request channel here and get some eyes on that and just see what it would look like in terms of an implementation, but I imagine it could be quite quick to be able to do that.
Peter Trang: And the other so-called feature request is I see a filtering, but there's no sorting option. There's only due date. I'm not able to sort by the other columns.
Colton O'Farrell: So the adding filter would be more so for trying to drill down on a specific customer or outstanding bills that you have with them. I'm happy to also include information about being able to sort just by most recent bill, oldest bill, just clicking the tabs and having that ordered.
Peter Trang: Exactly. Maybe sorting by bill number, sorting by amount or something that That'd be great. So if say, let's say this is paid outside of Nickel and I want to mark it as paid, there's another, there's an option.
Colton O'Farrell: So can you go click out of this for a moment?
Peter Trang: Okay.
Colton O'Farrell: So just click the box and look at the, oh, it does not have it for the bill pay section. It's paid outside of Nickel.
Peter Trang: Yeah. Cool.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, I think there might be a little bit less functionality on the AP side, because if you go to Get Paid and click on a box of one of the invoices you have, there's a box that says Mark as Paid. So we do have that on the accounts receivable side, but I'm not sure if it's just not built out yet for the accounts payable side.
Peter Trang: Okay.
Colton O'Farrell: But happy to. To surface that to them as well and get you some more information on this.
Peter Trang: Okay. And then you mentioned there's a two-way sync in QuickBooks, right?
Colton O'Farrell: Yep.
Peter Trang: When I'm. Let's just say I paid this person through nickel with a credit card, specifically the American Express card ending in 1006 or something. Right?
Colton O'Farrell: Yep.
Peter Trang: Well, well, it. Will it send back to QuickBooks being paid? How would it show up in QuickBooks? Will it show up as being paid by credit card ending in this or will it show up by just paid through Nickel?
Colton O'Farrell: Well, so when you get the payment, so if you remember that attachment or PDF I sent you after we got, I paid like the bill via to you, so you will get the payment like PDF confirmation from that, and it will also mark in QuickBooks that it's been paid. I don't know what the specific marking will be on that end, but I do know that your customer will get a confirmation. You'll get like a PDF receipt.
Peter Trang: Yeah.
Colton O'Farrell: Similar to that.
Peter Trang: I'm more concerned about how is it logged in QuickBooks so that for our reconciliation purposes, you know, because in QuickBooks we have accounts, right? We have our credit cards as accounts and we want to make sure it's is tied to. So one thing about the previous platform that I, I was kind of. Sort. Of trying to get them to fix or push because everything was grouped as paid via Tola, right? Which is, so I just wanted to know if that's the same case for your, your, you know, platform where it says everything is going to be grouped as paid in via nickel. and not specifically via what payment method I use. Right. Is that something you can check and double check?
Colton O'Farrell: Absolutely. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Well, cool, Peter. I have some follow-up that I need to do on my end. Let me just get talking with the team on some of the, you know, obviously the most critical aspects like getting making sure all attachments from QuickBooks are on the accounts payable side, but also discuss options like marking a bill as paid What if it it's looks like paid on the outside QuickBooks of Nickel on accounts side, payable, when a bill has been paid, how it's registered, if it's whether it's Nickel or listing the specific payment method. Can I ask what your preference would.
Peter Trang: Be on that as well?
Colton O'Farrell: On which one? On when those payments show up in Nickel, or do you have a preferred way of, or sorry, when those payments done via Nickel show up in QuickBooks Online, do you have a preferred method.
Peter Trang: Saying like that's paid out in that specific card, if it's specific card paid or for specific by Nickel? account payment method. Oh, I definitely Cool. Yeah. Wanted For to example, have it if say, I paid it via my bank ACH, you know, it says exactly what that number is. Yeah. Because that, that gives me, it makes it so much easier to reconcile versus kind of having to dig back in to see, okay, where did that come from? Right. So. So that way I don't, I don't have to do extra work to tell my bookkeeper, this is how I paid it. Right. So she knows exactly how it's paid.
Colton O'Farrell: Of course, yep. And then the other one was just nicknaming a payment methods, credit cards, just adding that functionality as well. Is there anything else that I missed?
Peter Trang: No, I think so far everything looks pretty straightforward. I think some functionality, more functionality would be great if reporting are able to pull in most upcoming bills or past due things that if we if my goal is to use Nickel more than QuickBooks for my purposes, then obviously the more visibility, more functionality, that would be great. But for now, I think it should be able to get done whatever I need to. The other question I had, I sent to you a question previously is if I were to get a CSV file of all my vendors account numbers, routing number and account number. Is that something that you guys can upload?
Colton O'Farrell: Yep.
Peter Trang: Okay. Because right now, obviously the vendors, you know, there's not missing details, right? Yep.
Colton O'Farrell: So that would be something our team would want to upload just to Make sure that the field mapping translations, all that makes sense. So we don't want to have a bunch of, you know, each CSV file could have you know, different fields there. So they just want to make sure that like the field mapping is correct, get it uploaded, but you would just message the team and let them know, Hey, I have a CSV file that I would like to upload that has my customer information. What's the best way to do that? And they will either ask to receive it or they will guide you on that process.
Peter Trang: Okay, perfect. Yeah, because I would prefer not to do them manually one at a time. And I'm trying not to ask my contractors or clients to enter all their information so we have it. we wanted to kind of make it a seamless switch over from my previous didn't think was possible. Just letting know this is how you'll be getting paid. Everything's done on the back end. You don't have to do anything on your end.
Colton O'Farrell: Of course.
Peter Trang: Yeah. But anyway, I appreciate your time. Thank you again.
Colton O'Farrell: Absolutely, Peter. I'll get those answers to your questions. We'll be in touch. I owe you an email before end of day today here. So let me just get the necessary information I need from our team. I'll let you know and we can go from there.
Peter Trang: Perfect. And I guess, sorry to do, I know you're good. So I know I set up, I didn't see it like a very extensive KYC process. Has my account been approved? Are they good to go? I mean, yeah, you're good to go. Okay. Okay. Okay. I just want to make sure that that's the case.
Colton O'Farrell: I know, I mean, these calls like the, you know, me having a conversation with you, learning more about your business, how you're looking to use Nickel. I mean, I'm All of our team has seen those notes, so they're well aware. And I mean, obviously there's only certain information that we're able to share, but yes, we follow all Know youw Customer, Anti-Money Laundering, Federal Bank Secrecy Act, and there's been no issues on your end from what I can see. So you're good to use Nickel as UC Fed.
Peter Trang: Okay, okay. Final question, okay. My business partner, my wife, obviously, she has credit cards under her name that we used to pay as well. if I were to add her name, a credit card does not my name specifically, would that be a problem or?
Colton O'Farrell: It shouldn't be.
Peter Trang: If I run into anything or you see anything on your side, please let me know. We can always work on it, work through that. All right? Absolutely.
Colton O'Farrell: Absolutely.
Peter Trang: Yeah.
Colton O'Farrell: There shouldn't be any issues there. I mean, that's a very common use case that we see all the time.
Peter Trang: Okay.
Colton O'Farrell: So the only time there would be issues is if it was like, you know, lots of charges that were made, there wasn't sufficient credit or funds, chargebacks, issues on that kind of front. If like the payments are being rejected, that's where we get more kind of on the investigative side of, okay, what's going on here? Is this, you know, how is this company actually looking to use Nickel? Does it fit within our best practices, use cases? But as long as, you know, it's used as normally, you're clearly added as an authorized user, there should be All no problem.
Peter Trang: Right, perfect.
Colton O'Farrell: Awesome. Cool, Peter. Well, I'll get you that email before end of day, but pleasure speaking with you again. And thank you so much for the feedback and product recommendations.
Peter Trang: It's really important to us.
Colton O'Farrell: So I appreciate you letting us know.
Peter Trang: Great. Thank you as well. All right. Speak to you soon, Peter. Bye. Bye.
