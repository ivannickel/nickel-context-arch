Jimmy Nguyen: Nothing much so far. We're working through the nickel platform right now. We're about to get ready to send out our first invoice. So we just had a couple of questions just to make sure we're doing everything correctly. We're not doing anything that might put us on the. On the Naughty Lister, anything like that. Sure. One of the biggest questions we had is, so nickel isn't integrating or syncing all of our invoices. And I think the workaround that we've had found out is if we just edit the invoice really quick, it'll pop up into the invoice list. Is this an intended.
Christian Sheerer: It should not sync the open ones. I mean. Sorry, the opposite. It should only sync the open ones.
Jimmy Nguyen: So I think we have more. So right now it says we have 107 open invoices. Okay. Guarantee you we have a lot more than that. Okay. And so far, the only way to actually, like, let's say one of the invoices we wanted to send was for this specific customer. We would go to that open invoice. It's not currently in nickel. It's open on qbo. We would go into qbo, just do like a quick edit, like a minus one, then add one just so it'll show up in the audit history, and. And then it'll get synced into nickel. Okay.
Christian Sheerer: Is that okay? Can you. Can you give me an example?
Jimmy Nguyen: Yeah. Are you under our Surgenics LLC right now?
Christian Sheerer: I am looking at it, yeah.
Jimmy Nguyen: Yeah. So invoice number 36117, this is the one that we're looking to kind of be our test guinea pig. And also, let me know if you think this amount is a little too high. We wanted to make sure, you know, we're not sending something too small too. No, this.
Christian Sheerer: I got you. Yeah, I know that. This is. This is. This is good. Yeah.
Jimmy Nguyen: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: That is good.
Jimmy Nguyen: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: And so this one, you needed to edit to pull it in?
Jimmy Nguyen: Yeah. So originally it wasn't in nickel. And, yeah, the workaround we found was just a quick edit, just to kind of refresh it. Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: I think that's a smart workaround. You might also. It might be. You might benefit also by pushing that QB sync. That is sort of a hard sync that happens sometimes when QB servers are, like, slower. So I can guess that with the volume, that might be a reason why it's not pulling every one of them over. So the top. Right. Maybe that might fix it in the future as well.
Jimmy Nguyen: Yes. So we had attempted that prior to finding out about the fix. Okay. Yeah, that was our first attempt and yeah, it still wasn't pulling over until we edited the invoice and then click the QB sync and then it would pull it over. Okay. I'm hoping if it's like a. It's only pulling over invoices that have been edited in the past week or like the past two weeks. And I don't believe it's also pulling over all of our customers. And I might also be thinking it's because they have no open invoices.
Christian Sheerer: That is likely. That's. That's usually the case. Right. If they don't have an open invoice, but. Or an open balance, but it still should pull over most of them.
Jimmy Nguyen: Yeah, it did pull over most of them. Yeah, there's just a couple of like the larger accounts that we did want to make sure it got pulled over just in case we wanted a perform like any remittance within the nickel platform. Okay. Kind of keep all of our eggs in one place.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, of course. I mean that's, that's the goal long term.
Jimmy Nguyen: What's a. Sorry. And I have Dennis. Dennis is in the room right with me. He's the manager of customer service. And then I also have Joseph Lines. He's going to be the accounting coordinator for the AR side. They're going to be the end users for the platform. So I'm also walking them through it, making sure everything's integrating correctly and establishing a workflow for them. So going to be in the background and they may also ask a couple questions as well.
Christian Sheerer: Okay. So did you want to go with the 36117? I forgot if that's the exact one.
Jimmy Nguyen: Yeah, 36117. Cool. That's so far our guinea pig invoice that we're going to be sending out. Cool.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. If you want to, if you want to screen share, I can walk you through it.
Jimmy Nguyen: Oh, so unfortunately I'm not the one on the nickel account.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, well, I can walk you through it verbally.
Jimmy Nguyen: Yeah, no, that works.
Christian Sheerer: So if you're in get paid and you pull it up, you can, you can search for it by invoice number 36117. That's to Valley Vine Health.
Jimmy Nguyen: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: And the contact info is correct?
Jimmy Nguyen: Yes, the contact info is correct. Cool.
Christian Sheerer: Patrick and Adrian also connected here.
Jimmy Nguyen: Yeah, the. Cool. Yeah. So I believe everybody under the email list is correct. And how. Is there a limit to how many people we can have in the email list? No. Okay.
Christian Sheerer: But I noticed that there are people from Surgeon X is that. Because you just want them to be cc'd.
Jimmy Nguyen: Yeah, Correct.
Christian Sheerer: You can. You can do that also in. I mean, you can do that. I think that's a smart way to do it. You can also do it, I guess. I don't know the size of the sales team. Those are salespeople, I assume.
Jimmy Nguyen: Yes. Okay. Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: If you're doing it on a per invoice basis, I think that's smart. You could also add it in the notifications tab in settings, but that currently is. That would be most of them. Like all of them. That would apply writ large across it and that would go to Alex.
Jimmy Nguyen: Yeah. With the notifications version, does that send them a notification every time?
Christian Sheerer: Well, yeah, it would be. It would be. Yeah, it would be for all of them. That's like a universal logic.
Jimmy Nguyen: Ah, okay. I think we were. We're going to stick with the, like the ad hoc per.
Christian Sheerer: That's smart. I agree. Yeah.
Jimmy Nguyen: Yeah. So I think we're all good to send it out. I think we're going to send it out now. Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: I would just make sure you're not marketing it as paid. You just. You hit request payment on when it shows up in sort of this spreadsheet type view. When you just look up 36117.
Jimmy Nguyen: Yep. All right, so we're under the get paid section. It's secure payment link. We have the correct customer number, all the correct emails that we want this invoice sent out to, and then we're just going to go ahead and click that send link. Yep. All right, perfect. All right, so it's sent to the five contacts that we're going to send it to. And yeah, they. I mean, as Alex was talking bringing up earlier, the. The reimbursement schedule is a big indicator as to when that invoice will get paid. Um, but moving forward, we're probably going to start sending out more. Do you know, because we are on that core plan at the moment, and I did see that there was like a 25, 000 invoice limit. Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: You guys should definitely be on plus.
Jimmy Nguyen: Yeah, yeah. So we're thinking about ramping up. So, like, the slow rollout is very important for us. We want to make sure this is like a system that's consistent and secure. Obviously, we don't want to push something out to the entire salesforce and then have it not work two days later. Totally fair. Yeah. So with the slow rollout, I think the. The plus or the pro is definitely the way we're going to go. But do you have any recommendations on the, I guess the range of invoices that we should be sending out kind.
Christian Sheerer: Of to test it? 0 to 25,000.
Jimmy Nguyen: All right.
Christian Sheerer: It'll only. Yeah, Core will only work up to 25,000. There are some people who hopefully they try to juggle all of the limitations of Core because they're like, oh, I'll just send 25,000. And that just like ends up making a lot more work that is probably less worth than 35 or probably more time wasted than is equivalent to 35 bucks a month, if that makes sense.
Jimmy Nguyen: Oh, are they splitting up the invoice into 25,000?
Christian Sheerer: Just like a little. It's a little, A little silly, but. But I only bring that up to say that like $25,000 transactions will work in court. They'll work across all of them.
Jimmy Nguyen: Yeah. Okay. And then just so I can get some information. So Alex isn't going to be able to make it to the meeting today, but I did see there is that. That option, the nickel Pro. So this is like that custom solutions with. For higher volume. Would we apply more for a higher volume or I guess like a higher invoice amount?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, we open that up for. I think for you guys it would probably be if you're doing a transaction above a million dollars and we need to think through that. The other times that we'll open it up is or we have to take the Pro route is if there's a custom API that we need to build. Think like large manufacturers using something like a Pro, like an Epicore or a Sage or something else. And then it's very variable on what Pro can mean. I think if there's a request that we think is useful for us to build out long term, there might be an upfront, like implementation fee to build it. Depending on engineering resourcing. We could have a conversation between yourself and Claudio again and like really break down what would be diverting from our, like our typical development path and like.
Jimmy Nguyen: What that would cost.
Christian Sheerer: And so like the Pro sort of ranges. But I think the most immediate one is if transaction is going to be above a million dollars.
Jimmy Nguyen: Do you think within, I guess the next year that we'll be sending out a million dollar invoice? Occasionally? We already do. Yeah. Okay. But it doesn't happen, you know, often. But about how often does that happen? Let's say in a year long span. Maybe once a month. So what? Once a month? So I would say like maybe. So maybe like what, nine? Like 12?
Christian Sheerer: Two or three.
Jimmy Nguyen: Yeah. So two or three in the past month. So it could be upwards. Okay, let's definitely keep that on the table. I are. We're definitely going growing. As you can tell, we're growing faster than our means of hiring and getting more heads to pick up the phone. So yeah, I think the Nickel Pro would definitely be the best upgrade for us. Just because I can see us sending larger and larger invoices, especially within the next two quarters.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, that is sort of in my. Was already on my time horizon as well.
Jimmy Nguyen: Right.
Christian Sheerer: Like, if we're going to kind of take this phased approach. Yeah, it's on the table. Simple. Suffice to say, I think the only thing I would flag there is if there are other particular build outs that we need to do as part of.
Jimmy Nguyen: That.
Christian Sheerer: We can build that customization via conversation with Claudio. We're also going to be growing. There should be some. I don't know if I'm allowed to say it, but there should be some good news soon in terms of like, you know, our growth trajectory. And so we'll have, you know, more dedicated engineering resources. We're going to probably grow the team pretty fastly as well over the course of the year. And so we want to be nimble around things that you guys want as well. Not to say, you know, I'm going to promise the world because then I'll go back into the office and Claudio will smack me. But. But yeah, all of those things are on the table as well. Like, and it would just require kind of like a dev to dev team kind of chat about what you guys want specifically.
Jimmy Nguyen: Yeah, sounds good. Do you guys have any precedents of integrating with NetSuite? I'm sorry if I asked this already, but.
Christian Sheerer: No, no, no, it's okay. Are you expecting a transition in NetSuite soon?
Jimmy Nguyen: Hopefully it is a. Definitely a fingers crossed because I believe we're also outgrowing QBO at this rate. So netsuite is on the horizon. I wouldn't say it's anytime like six months soon, but nine to 12 months out I think is a good time frame for when we're thinking about it. And a good. A big plus for Alex would be when we do incorporate NetSuite, if we could just also incorporate that Nickel Pro right into it and just bake it all into one package.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, so we. So that is an instance. We have customers who use NetSuite and that's been an instance where we've like gone the pro route with them. I think we would probably have a native API integration that isn't custom for people who are using NetSuite before, that's nine to 12 months. So I think that aligns kind of well based on what I've heard from. From the engineering team.
Jimmy Nguyen: So.
Christian Sheerer: Yes.
Jimmy Nguyen: All right. Do you guys have any questions? So, more than likely we're going to be. Oh, so I'm going to give you an overall timeline. We're going to be pushing out maybe three to five invoices within the next. For each week. For the next two weeks, we're looking to upgrade to that Pro. Not. Sorry, to the plus first, just because we do need more than the three active users. So we're looking to, you know, upgrade to that nickel plus. And then after the upgrade, later down the line, if the netsuite is coming around the corner faster than we thought, we can reopen the conversation about upgrading to Pro.
Christian Sheerer: Wonderful. Yeah, let's do that. I. I would say, well, I appreciate the clarity on the timeline. And then the second would be if we want to wait over the next two weeks, we can. And we can talk through any workflow challenges. Support is always going to be open, too, if there's like, a quick support thing that you need. But we can talk through any workflow challenges that you might need my brain for and coordination for as well as we can plot out, you know, after those two weeks, what November looks like and then December and just keep an open line of communication for any kind of, like, evolution of. Of what we need to do for y'.
Jimmy Nguyen: All. Oh, yeah, no, that sounds great. Cool.
Christian Sheerer: Well, I think you guys are thinking about it in the right cadence. I will get an answer on where the hiccup in the sink was. I mean, I think you found a good kind of, like, quick workaround for.
Jimmy Nguyen: It.
Christian Sheerer: But I'll drill down into that.
Jimmy Nguyen: And. Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: Do you expect those to be. So you mentioned that this one is the one that you sent out 31167 or whatever it was 36117. Right. 36117 was a reimbursement.
Jimmy Nguyen: This. Is this an IVR one? I'm pretty sure, yes. I'm not 100 sure. Yeah. So this one is more than likely an IVR one if it's, I believe, to do those two sales employees.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, it's that product coded, most likely.
Jimmy Nguyen: Yeah. Cool.
Christian Sheerer: No, the only reason I ask is if we want to get back to schedule getting back together over the next two weeks, like after those process. And if you expect them to process within the two weeks, meaning they actually will pay, it's no issue for Us like again, invoice aging is not a problem. It's just to make the most of our time if we're troubleshooting that workflow.
Jimmy Nguyen: Yeah, no, let's go ahead and put something on the calendar for two weeks out. Let me go ahead and see Alex's availability really quick just so we can try to work something out better for him if he has any of that of the higher level questions. Yeah, let's go ahead and try to do two weeks out. We could try Tuesday again later in the days. Usually better to grab Alex. So if you wanted to meet maybe the 2:30 or even the 2 mountain time. So it'd be the 5:30 to 6, I believe your time.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, yeah, that's the slot. So that's perfect. That works great for me.
Jimmy Nguyen: Yeah, let's go ahead and get that scheduled because I mean, yeah, we're definitely going to be touching base. So I think getting something on the calendar would help us a lot. Cool.
Christian Sheerer: So just title it check in.
Jimmy Nguyen: Cool.
Christian Sheerer: Send it to. Is there anybody else people in the room with you I should add or just YouTube?
Jimmy Nguyen: I think for the check in we're mainly going to be grabbing all of the feedback and kind of putting it in one communication channel. So I think the two of us is okay for now.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, wonderful. I'll send that out.
Jimmy Nguyen: Cool.
Christian Sheerer: And what else can I do for you today?
Jimmy Nguyen: I think that's pretty much it so far. Yeah, we're just trying to get familiar with the platform and it's not ridiculously hard. It's very intuitive. But yeah, we branded our personal payment portal sending out voices. We're trying to figure out some of the better ones to send out that where hopefully will get reimbursed within the next two weeks just so we can have some process payments for our touch base. Yep. Cool.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, that's, that's, I mean again, aging, not a problem. But that was just so we can kill more birds with the, with the same meeting. Awesome. Well, I mean we're really excited frankly. And I think the open line of communication is good. Like we want to be adaptable. We're three about to be four years old, but still pretty, pretty lean and nimble. And we're going to have like an influx of engineering resources. So like we, we, we really appreciate kind of all the breaking down and, and clear, kind of, you know, don't be shy about making suggestions or asking questions because that's going to help us too.
Jimmy Nguyen: All right. Wonderful.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, I will get that over to them, let them know and put on the whiteboard. A little bit more bold than netsuite stuff.
Jimmy Nguyen: All right. Yeah, sounds great. That'll definitely be a big positive for Alex. Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: I mean, we. We, again, it's like, you guys aren't the only ones, right. Who use netsuite. Right. So. So all of this is kind of mutually beneficial.
Jimmy Nguyen: Yeah. All right, perfect. Is there anything that you need for me to ask from Alex before we end the meeting?
Christian Sheerer: No, I think I just wanted to make sure you guys were all set and that you had the right chart of accounts get linked up and pretty much where we left off when you were there with NJIR was just kind of the. The PII Information on the. On the accounting, on the account side. The bank account.
Jimmy Nguyen: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: So, no, I. I didn't. I think my role for now is going to be absorbing your feedback and kind of thinking through at a higher level and quarterbacking. Like what. You know, either fixes. I don't know if there's fixes, really, that we need to make, but just, you know, getting your comfortability and familiarity up with the platform and. And then continuing to quarterback the roll out.
Jimmy Nguyen: Sounds great, as always. I mean, you can always message us. We. We love the proactive communication. So if, like, you know, one random day you see our name come across the Risk management desk and you want to give us a heads up and say, hey, you guys need to figure out what you're doing, get your. Get your eggs in a bunch, please let us know.
Christian Sheerer: Yes.
Jimmy Nguyen: Security is our number one concern. Cool.
Christian Sheerer: I mean, same here. And so we will. And I'll. I'll. I'll know how to kind of maneuver all those.
Jimmy Nguyen: So.
Christian Sheerer: Same to you. I would echo the same thing. Any questions that come up, any things like, hey, you know, we're going to send the one above Nickel plus, you can always, like, kind of just go into your plans and go up to nickel plus. The first 14 days are free, and so no, no worries there. Like, you don't have to reach out to me if you want. If you want to just move into nickel plus, but you can as well, and we can chat through the differences.
Jimmy Nguyen: All right. Everything sounds good so far. Cool.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, really excited. I'm glad that you found it intuitive and. And I think you'll continue to. And so any of those kind of like, higher level things, like the pro conversation, netsuite stuff.
Jimmy Nguyen: The.
Christian Sheerer: I mean, I think I'll raise the fact that, you know, I think the. The QB stuff. Keep them coming.
Jimmy Nguyen: Yeah, no problem. Will do. Cool.
Christian Sheerer: Y' all have a good one.
Jimmy Nguyen: Thank you. You too. Thank you for all the help so far. Christian. Have a great.
Christian Sheerer: No problem.
Jimmy Nguyen: Yeah. See you. Yep. Bye. Bye.
