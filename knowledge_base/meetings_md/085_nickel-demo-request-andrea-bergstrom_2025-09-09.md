Andrea: Not a problem. All right. Well, thank you for setting that. I'm glad you were available for this pretty quickly. We currently use QuickBooks, so, and I understand this would be an integration with QuickBooks, correct?
Christian Sheerer: Mm-.
Andrea: Great. All right. I mean, I'm excited to see this because right now we have no way, we don't accept credit card payments and, you know, just to give you a 15 second overview of who we are. We're a technology company. We create robotic systems. So generally, we don't even need to accept credit cards, right? Because we're doing things that the most companies are not going to pay for with the credit card. However, we just had somebody tell us, hey, can we pay you with the credit card? Or ask that question. And we couldn't. So, and it's like for, you know, $900 or something. Piddly dink, it's just a little thing. So I'm wondering how soon could we do this if we're interested? And I know I'd like to see a demo, but my first question is how soon could we do this?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, so this is to get one payment?
Andrea: No, we're going to ultimately do this. No, no, no. So this would just be set up so that we could start to receive, first of all, I want to also be able to pay our contractors this way, or contractors this way. And from what I understand, it's not just credit card payments that we could receive. We could have ACH come through this direction as well, correct? This could be our essentially what I'm going to send out so that our we get payments maybe just all through one place and then we get it into QuickBooks, right? Okay.
Christian Sheerer: Okay. And so what is that looking like monthly on the AR and the AP side?
Andrea: Oh, I don't have the numbers for you on that. I'm sorry. I don't know what that would be off the top of my head.
Christian Sheerer: And.
Andrea: I can't tell you how many or whatever. I mean, I literally just thought about that or just looked into you guys late yesterday, so. I don't know. I would have to go back and look at what the volume would be. Does that preclude us from doing business with you?
Christian Sheerer: No, it's just something we like to know in the case that there is like a small number of invoices with a large amount per invoice or the opposite, like a small per invoice and like a huge amount of invoices. It's how we think about onboarding and how we think about pricing.
Andrea: I mean, I'll just big picture tell you that usually our payments are going to be, you know, tens of thousands or a couple hundred thousand or something like that. That's the payments that we're receiving.
Christian Sheerer: Okay.
Andrea: So that's our accounts receivable looks like. And then, and we're growing technology, so companies, so hopefully it just continues to get better and better and, you know, more frequently and so forth. And the payments that we make to the 1099 contractors, that's usually about every two weeks is when we're giving them payment when they're submitting their invoices. And right now that's three people, which I did have a question. Can we pay somebody who's outside of the US or no?
Christian Sheerer: We can accept payments outside of the US via credit card. But international payments are in, like we're building that out now, we're going through sort of the, what is it? Regulatory process, building it out with a partner that can like have the rails go through. And so it's in development, but and that's something that we want. I don't know the exact timeline, but I think our goal is by the end of the year. But yeah, we'll be proactive in communicating about like when you guys are using the platform, hey, you know, you can send out international payments. What share of that, what or what share of payments are?
Andrea: That's very, that's pretty small. I would say, you know, $20,000 a year or something. We're a federal contractor, so we do a lot of business with the DOD as a percentage of our total business. So we don't, we're not buying things from, we, well, one company that's outside of the US, but everything else, and that's just Canada. Everything else is purchased here in the US. The person that we would be paying is a contractor and he's in another country. So that's what I would love. I mean, I like to hear that that's in development.
Christian Sheerer: So. And.
Andrea: Sorry, I know I'm just shooting all over the place here with my questions.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, I mean, what's, I think would be helpful to kind of gear us in, in like a, you know, a way that you could see the full picture of it is to kind of break it up half and half into AR and AP. What was that final question?
Andrea: Oh, I mean, I just had a few more on, I mean, I have quite a few questions actually, but on, okay, okay. Go ahead. 1099S. So how do they receive the payment? So we issue this payment. Does it go direct into a bank account that they set up or how do they receive the funds?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, everything will be direct deposit sent to them via ACH. You could also, I guess, I I figure you can pay via credit card because it's not usual payroll, but. So. Let, yeah, let me show you on both sides. I think it's probably easier to tell you, to show you than to tell you.
Andrea: Absolutely. That's fine. And I assume that if it, hey, if it's just going direct deposit or ACH, they don't have to pay any fee for for the service, correct? The 10%?
Christian Sheerer: Oh, no, no, no, yeah. Yeah. I mean, the only fees that we get paid on either side.
Andrea: If a.
Christian Sheerer: Credit card transaction is made.
Andrea: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: So the idea why, and the reason we don't really flinch at like, oh, our payments are going to be hundreds of thousands of dollars, There's a payment that's above a million dollars. We also have to have a conversation about pricing because our tier Nickel Plus, which is what a majority of people are on, the limit there is a million dollars per transaction. The reason I ask about volume is. Because. If you're doing like you are more than $25,000 per transaction sometimes, we're already in Nickel Plus territory and doing a million per transaction, sometimes we're in like a Nickel Pro, we have to kind of think through that in a custom way based on how that works.
Andrea: And we do have contracts that are million dollar contracts, but thankfully it doesn't pay out always, or at the end, it pays out with deliverables. So, yeah, I don't think, I mean, at this stage, we're not going to receive a million dollar payment. Anytime in the near future, but who knows? That could happen.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, yeah, yeah. I'm just kind of, you know, stating that for to also explain sort of like how Nickel got started as a technology wherein we realized that nobody was really serving kind of like the industrial small or medium or even industrial business space for handling payments. Usually those were like relegated to like proprietary tools that large vendors or large customers had set up for themselves. And so it was kind of like this disaggregated situation or it was forcing kind of, you know, industrial businesses to use some things like a Stripe or like a QuickBooks payments, right? Which would charge 1% per ACH even transaction, even more on the credit card side. And then also just like freak out if you send like $20,000 through the platform. Yeah, it's like automatically flag it as fraud or, you know, just make you go through all of those multifactor authentication tests and checks to be able to go and send out that money. We have a funny story of like we use Stripe to pay Zoom or something like that. One of our software vendors who uses them and our founder, even though we have Nickel, we had a $20,000 check and it took him like a week to clear. We found and their background, he came from Stanley Black & Decker, the other founder came from Airbnb. And they were like, oh, okay, like there's these large trends, there's this like opportunity here where if we can start from the beginning and building a payments infrastructure that like suits them, then it actually is probably a pretty lightweight solution that can be built on top of that, you know, actually intense, more intense, I guess, if that's, if that's the if that's a word that makes sense there. Architecture, like infrastructure below it. All right. So, like, AR and AP, and it should be pretty foolproof. Again, we're dealing with a lot of people who are sort of stuck in the 20th century, only doing checks. Right. And so we, we've kind of made it, like, super simple for those invoices to get paid out. And so your question was around, like, how does, yeah, like, it was a, it was a basic one, but it's the right one. It's like, how does the money move? Right. How does it actually, you know, how do I get people to get paid. So you'll link up QuickBooks first and any of those ones with the icon are coming from QuickBooks that can also always create, you know, bills and new vendors in nickel, which will also sync up into QuickBooks. So if you want to do it first or in nickel first, however you want.
Andrea: Mm-.
Christian Sheerer: And I'm going to send a bill to a vendor, either I have their information or I can request it from them. And everything's primarily email based. And then I'll just send, okay, I want them, you know, their details so I can send them money. And then in another tab. I'll open my email. So I sent it to me as my fake vendor. And so then they'll see just like quick debrief on what Nickel is, right? So they know who we are, we're connecting to their bank account to send you guys money. Or to send them money, in this case, their vendor, but they'll see, you know, this stuff, they'll submit the information and then they'll link up their account and get paid.
Andrea: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: And so does that sort of clear it up on the vendor side? Yeah.
Andrea: And how soon do they receive if I process their payment today? To pay one of our vendors. How soon do they actually receive the ACH? Is it typical just like in a bank? Is that or is there a delay on this at all?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, it is two business day turnaround. For. ACH, one business day turnaround for credit card.
Andrea: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: And you just have to get those cut off during the day is 4:00 PM Eastern.
Andrea: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: So meaning if it's after 4:00 PM Eastern, it'll get processed and then it'll get pulled over. Yeah.
Andrea: I have a banking background, so I definitely know the importance of the cutoffs. Okay. And then so continue on with the demo.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, yeah.
Andrea: I mean, let you show me, maybe many of my questions are being answered despite watching the demo.
Christian Sheerer: And I can, I mean, I can also, I'm adaptable. So you asked me a question, I can click around to the right spot, but like, you know, just to knock off one of the earlier questions about like sending out an invoice or receiving one, it's the same sort of process. So I've set up recurring ones, I've set up, you know, one, One's sorry.
Andrea: Yeah, right. Single pays.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah.
Andrea: So that was going to be one of my questions is can I have this set up for recurring? Sounds like I can.
Christian Sheerer: Yes. Either or.
Andrea: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: So this one is a recurring one and I actually just set it up but I didn't send it to myself, which is my customer in this scenario. So I send it over here and I can either send a payment link, which is most typical way that we do things. Every payment is one to one. We're not batch processing. You can do things in bulk. I can hit all of them and send the payment requests. Or I can just go individually and send that out. And it's one to one. We can do it in bulk, but we're not batch processing, so there's no risk of co-mingling funds because each payment as a secure payment link. So I'll send it to Christian. My. Customer, and hopefully I get that already. Yeah. So I have this payment request. Oh. We're getting the death spin. Oh, got it. Okay, cool. I just need to refresh. And. They'Ll see a bunch of things. One is the details on the invoice. If that's coming from QuickBooks and you already have line items in a PDF built in, that'll get attached. I can show you what it looks like when I make a new invoice. But I can edit this and that'll be live on that payment link.
Andrea: Oh, good. So like if somehow there's a mistake, I could go back somehow.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, exactly. You can edit it there. Yeah, you can always hard edit.
Andrea: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: And then this link should update. Yeah.
Andrea: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: And so that's that one-to-one payment link for that invoice for, you know, I titled it the first payment for this recurring, it starts on this day, it ends on this day, what have you. And then they get to choose how they pay. So like, you know, that's sort of our philosophy is like give them all of the options and then they'll pick the one that's easiest for them. And, you know, they won't have really to hassle you for, oh, I need to send you my account routing number or I need to, you know, I'm.
Andrea: We don't really want their banking information, so that's great. I never have to have by doing.
Christian Sheerer: This, you never have to collect it.
Andrea: Yeah, that's great. And then they see, like you're showing right there the fee, they're seeing that as their option. They could pay by credit card if they wanted. And if, like I said, I don't think we're going to have a high volume of that, but I don't know. I mean, who knows? Maybe we should put our corporate merch up and people want to buy it. I'm kidding. Oh, yeah. All right.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, no, I mean, some, I mean, yeah, it's, it's, it's funny like that, that option is, there's people who were using us for, or sorry, had just transitioned to us and they're like, Hey, we've only taken checks the entirety of the time that we've done business and then they offer the options and then the people for the benefits that they get with their credit card to start using credit card shoots up to like, you know, 20-ish percent of their volume.
Andrea: Oh, wow.
Christian Sheerer: And they were doing, yeah, I mean, that might be case by case, but because, no, you're right. But they're still doing those large transactions. Like they're one of those bigger kind of high volume, low, high amount, lower volume amount of transactions. Yeah.
Andrea: Interesting. Okay, so I understand how to do this part or, you know, that seems very easy.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. And then they'll also see the other invoices that were sent out to them. So. I've sent other invoices to this person and they can link into them, but they're going to be different links.
Andrea: Can they set it up so that it's automatic that when I send them a payment, it automatically is paid or can they not necessarily do it that way? Okay.
Christian Sheerer: So the way we would do that is by adding their customer payment method. And then you'll have to send it to them. You'll add a bank account, add a card, whatever. Yeah. You need some authorization document, right? That can prove they've given consent to pull funds from them.
Andrea: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: So I'll do that from the get-go. So I had already created this invoice yesterday. But I'm going to create a new one for and I'm going to use my same email, but it's a new customer. And again, this is me doing it in in QuickBooks and it'll port over. What is this for? Some deposit of something and make it $100,000 and we'll do it one time or recurring, whatever. Any documents that you've attached will get included. You can create that, you can make the date in the future, what have you. You can also split these up. So the day that you send it out and the day that it's due is a different date. But if you're collecting via their payment method, it might be just the same amount. And so I'm going to charge the payment method and then I'll add their stuff. But if I'm adding a customer and I want to set up payment authorization, Sorry, I need to make it into one. You can enter their information if you have it already, or you can set it up with some parameters, right? So full permission, just meaning like no limits or expiration, limited permission, so a max amount per transaction, and they're going to see these terms of what you've requested based on some conversation that you've had with them, I assume. Put in no expiration date or no transaction limit or a specific date. And then some. Note. And then I'll show you what that looks like. It looks similar to what it looked like on the vendor side when I'm requesting information for them. They'll get a breakdown of what Nickel is, privacy and security stuff, and then what terms that you had, you know, determined with them will be. The, I don't know, bylaws by which you, you know, take stuff out and they'll get to read our terms, see all that fancy stuff, click through, and then they'll choose the payment method they want, which we will store exactly like you don't, you don't have to.
Andrea: Yep.
Christian Sheerer: And so then after that, you'll just be able to pull them. So, yeah, either as soon as you send the invoice. Like you'll just go through sending that invoice to them and charge the payment method on file and schedule the charge.
Andrea: Great. And then I guess this leads to, I think one of my questions was, can I set this up at the very beginning of a relationship with say a vendor of ours? I literally know that every month we're going to be charged $289. Can I just, I mean, I know right now I have some autopay set up through them, but if I wanted to just make the payment coming through this instead of doing it or whatever, maybe it's a new vendor. Can I literally have this like no end date, just continue on that way? If I'm hit by a bus, hey, all they have to do is come in here and look and that vendor is set up for every month we're paying them. Whatever that same $289 and it never ends.
Christian Sheerer: Or, yeah, you would put, we do have an end date. I think we should build out something. I think it's a good idea to build out.
Andrea: Maybe like in 10 years or whatever. If I know it's our, yeah, just.
Christian Sheerer: Throw it all the way into the future. Yeah. Okay. You can do that. So you can set up recurring receivables and payables. Yes.
Andrea: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: And month, week, quarter here.
Andrea: Okay, great. And then, let's see. You've answered a lot of my questions here on some of this. So this is totally separate from this from you know, what we've been discussing. But is there a way to have corporate card management in this also or.
Christian Sheerer: No, that's a bit broad of a question. What exactly?
Andrea: So, like, if we have our American Express and I want to see everybody's transactions dumped into here, like, can I do that, or is that not really?
Christian Sheerer: You totally could. I think it would be a little bit. Of a. I mean, I think that's somewhere we want to get to.
Andrea: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: I think it would be a little bit of a. Because it's a different card for each person that's paying out with it.
Andrea: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: Okay.
Andrea: Okay. I mean, I just wanted to know. I didn't.
Christian Sheerer: No, no, no. I mean, I'm. There's a way that you could kind of sort of, like, hack it together. For sure. But I would say that our, like, our primary way that it's configured now is for those business to business transactions.
Andrea: On, like, yeah, more AR and AP.
Christian Sheerer: Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, there's a vision for us where we want to get to where, you know, like, We are the way that we think about payments is like it's the lifeblood, literally. I don't know if you go back to old 19th century kind of like analogies of how they built out the way they talk about economics, it's like literally like money is the blood of the, you know, the national unit or whatever, right? So like we think about it that way. And so we do want to have sort of like a one stop shop for all of payments for like industrial businesses.
Andrea: I just think it makes sense to be able to see it. And I haven't asked you about reporting yet, but for me to be able to show, I work for the two co-founders, for me to be able to show them everything, you know, would be nice because I know what they're going to think as well. Okay, but that doesn't include credit cards. That doesn't, you know, so I would think, and I'm glad to hear that that's kind of maybe in the future. And I get it. I could probably, you're right, with integrations and everything. I'm sure I could get it, you know, connect the information that I want to, but okay. And then on, so we've talked about like for our customers, but then what about for, I guess we've already kind of covered the other, but can you just take me through like can you go back to where you're showing me the demo and show me some other areas that we haven't discussed yet?
Christian Sheerer: Like, which ones are top of mind?
Andrea: So. Okay, so we're. Show me the summary, for example. I don't know that I missed this. That's my dashboard, right?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, this we. I mean, this is a fake environment, which isn't getting populated. We're not really prioritizing this for the fake one, but. But, yeah, you'll see these in a nice little dashboard.
Andrea: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: I think reporting is something that, you know, we're thinking about in. In. Visualizing in unique ways. You can always see all of the transactions to and fro, receivables, payables, filter them as you'd like, see all the notes for them, see which ones are coming in via QuickBooks. And I think in terms of the full scope picture, you guys are using QuickBooks online or desktop?
Andrea: We're not using desktop. I don't know. To online pretty soon.
Christian Sheerer: Okay. So we have an API integration with online. When we build out integrations for desktop, we typically do it with a 2025 type integration. So we'll have an AI agent connect into, we'll just request some information from you about getting into desktop so that we can pull it and make sure it acts in in a live fashion so that it's connecting back and forth. And I call it 2025 type integration versus like the API 2018 type integration. We should have both soon, but for those ones that are doing desktop, sometimes even quicker, less security vulnerabilities and stuff like that. But the reason I go into that is because I think a majority of the reporting, because that will still be, we wouldn't replace QuickBooks as the I think the majority of the reporting and visibility into that would still live there. And then you would come into Nickel to make sure that those payments happen swiftly and cheaply. And be able to pull those invoices back from QuickBooks desktop that you're creating there and send them out through Nickel and then still get reconciled on the back end back into QuickBooks and then visible in full. You know, once they're cleared.
Andrea: Yeah, that makes sense. And all right. And then, I mean, gosh, it's all very, it seems very intuitive when I take a look at the, I mean, the transactions are the transactions have already occurred, right? So this I could look back for two, you know, flash forward in two years, I could go back and look at it from the past, you know, whatever period of time I wanted to. Look, correct?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. And you can always take it out into a CSV and plug it into your Excel version of choice. Usually Excel, but yeah. And you can see those ones which are completed, which are paid out, active means not to be paid or still some amount due if they've paid only a certain amount. Of the 100,000, these scheduled ones which might be like recurring into the future. And then, yeah, you can see them all and all the ones that haven't been, that are still active as well.
Andrea: Okay. And same thing under Bill Pay, it's gonna have the same kind of, I mean, I could still see the ones that are like, can I go in once a month, for example, and just handle all of this and it'll show me, oh, there's the schedule. Old once when on Bill pay, for example.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. You'd see all these ones cued. Yeah.
Andrea: Great. All right. So that goes back to my, I think one of my questions I asked at the very beginning, which I know it's quite put and cart before the horse, but if we, if I said, yeah, we're going to do this, how quickly could we be up and running? On this?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, good question. It takes like an hour to set up really to log in. I've sold software for what seems like a long time to me, but my whole career, which is a short one so far, but. But I've been at places where I would get to that stage of the conversation and they were ready for it, but I'd be like, hey, it's gonna take like four weeks to just like set up the tech. Right. Very grateful to be at Nickel now where I can say, oh, it's super easy. But we also have sort of a customer success team that will help you choose like the right sort of like, it's so super simple to get activated and ongoing, right? But they'll also work with you to sort of spread out how Nickel might fit into your full operational kind of standard operating procedures on the payment side, AR and AP based on your guys' timelines. And so that's usually around like a month of just, you know, a couple of calls with you and the customer success manager who will also then be available for you down the line. Let's say like a new feature rolls out. I'm trying to think of, oh yeah, like, you know, a nickel card, right? Like a nickel corporate card. And then they'll be sort of in charge of helping existing customers kind of wrap their heads around new things with a nickel. But they typically, you know, so like a month in that terms of onboarding phase where, you know, they'll set up a project with you that's like, okay, you know, we got these amount of vendors set up for the larger transactions ready to go. Let's now do the vendors for maybe the smaller ones or vice versa. That is typically the timeline that we say. But in order to get started and start transacting, I've seen people turn it around. We've done it on the call together, right? Because you just get on, sign in, link the account, and then you can start to send invoices and receive them the same day.
Andrea: Well, that would make me a hero to my boss who right now, he's like, Just make it happen. Just take care of it. And the company that owes us this $900 or whatever is like, oh, well, we set this up and we don't really have any other way to pay you. It's like, oh my God. So my boss doesn't want to deal with it. He just wants me to have the solution. So I'm going to brief him on this. I don't think I have any other questions because it sounds like, frankly, today I could set it up. Yeah, you could.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. And that's typically what we do. Or what I and my counterpart on the new business side, when we interact with people who are thinking about Nickel for the first time prescribe is we say, okay, cool. You got a general understanding of the full thing and there might be some things that we need to troubleshoot, but we send you not into the wild. We'll set some time up for maybe about a week from now where we can reconnect and chat through anything that was confusing in your initial setup. And so send you to the wild and you get logged on. It's very simple. And maybe you run a couple of those quicker transactions that you needed this quick turnaround time for. And then we can come back and troubleshoot any things that you happen to stumble upon when you were working through that. Answer any other questions about the future state of, okay, I set it up in this way for this customer, but I have a batch of customers that are going to be paying us in a different way. Can you just remind me how we do that again? And vendors, same thing. And then also on that call, we typically save maybe the last 10 minutes of like, okay, cool. What is this feeling like in terms of your organization writ large? Because our goal, we don't want Nickel to be just like a It's useful for us right now, right? Because it's like, hey, I need to get set up pretty quickly and I need to send it out. But we don't want you to think about it just like, oh, we needed.
Andrea: To send one quick payment.
Christian Sheerer: Like we really. And that's not the intent.
Andrea: I wouldn't. Yeah, exactly. No, no, no, exactly.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah.
Andrea: Probably just say, okay, figure it out. And, you know, so this really isn't, to be clear, this is not about that one credit card. It is about like, okay, we need something. We need a better way to pay our 1099s.
Christian Sheerer: We need this may
Andrea: be a solution for us. All around. And frankly, I don't like sending our bank information to other companies, which right now we've done because we're paying them, you know, we're paying, you know, whatever companies, and they have our banking information. And I really would rather they didn't, but it's in setting up the ACH, that's the only way we've been doing it. So this is going to be helpful for a number of reasons, I think.
Christian Sheerer: And so, yeah, that's exactly what I'm getting at is like we can also, because part of Part of the easiest thing to be able to explain to new people looking at Nickel is like, oh yeah, you'll save a lot of money on the fees, right? But that's not as interesting to me as like, okay, how do we roll out like a, you know, an essential business function for you, right? That's the more interesting and the more fun thing to think through. And so that's like, that's 90% of my job is like helping you think through that. What is, you know, you mentioned your owners have some kind of criteria about certain things that they want to think through. How do we piece it up with with the existing ERP, how do we manage that project and how do we manage for the time being wherein you'll have to kind of have like those corporate cards stay separate? Like how do we still kind of see everything all in one spot? That's what we'll set up that other time for. And also, you know, reviewing those first couple of transactions that you got needed to spin it up for quick.
Andrea: Yeah, yeah. And I do think, I mean, one of our, what we do is automation. That's our technology company is automation. So where I can add automation, it only helps because it goes right in line with what we do. So we can't have processes that are stuck in the, you know, in 2015.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. So crazy how fast this stuff goes where it's like, yeah, I could look back on 2015 and be like, yeah.
Andrea: It'S only going to get faster, right? Now it'll be what you used to see change in five years will start to happen in YouTube. So. All right, well, this is helpful, Christian Sheerer. I'm going to set up my account right after this meeting for my next meeting, and then I will get ready to actually, you know, transact, you know, some business here really shortly.
Christian Sheerer: And.
Andrea: I mean, I think that's the way to, to proceed here, so, yeah, all right.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, that is. And let's set up some time for next week so we can get back together, troubleshoot on those and plan out kind of with the larger scale onboarding looks like.
Andrea: Okay. So send over maybe a time for, I don't know, maybe send over your calendar availability, whatever, however you like to do it.
Christian Sheerer: But yeah, I have it up right now. What's typically good for you during the week? I'm pretty free next week. Yeah, Wednesday.
Andrea: Wednesday looks pretty good. Is usually my good day.
Christian Sheerer: What time usually in the morning is better?
Andrea: Now actually after 10 o'clock, well after 10 o'clock central is usually best.
Christian Sheerer: You're central? Where are you at?
Andrea: Chicago suburbs.
Christian Sheerer: Oh cool. We're all in Brooklyn mostly. One of us actually is in Chicago. I don't know if he's gonna move soon but yeah, you're a customer success person. His name is Colton, he's in Chicago.
Andrea: Oh, okay. Very good.
Christian Sheerer: Cool. So does 10 on the dot central work?
Andrea: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: On Wednesday? On the 17th?
Andrea: That sounds good.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, awesome. I'll send that over. And the same email works for you, Andrea.Bergstrom@yale.edu.
Andrea: It's Andrea. I'm not hung up on it, but it's Andrea.
Christian Sheerer: Oh, sorry. Sorry. Andrea, apologies. I should have done that at the beginning. And it's like, oh, you know, you have a name that's easy to pronounce. I'm not even going to ask. And then you go into it. Cool.
Andrea: There's four, actually, there's four different pronunciations of it. And what I have found is there's only two pronunciations. They get really bad out of shape. If you don't, I've spent 50 plus years going around this world. I've only run into the two pronunciations that get really bent if you don't pronounce it right. So yeah, default with Andrea because that's one of them.
Christian Sheerer: Somebody asked me yesterday, do you go by Christian or Chris? And I was like, I never know what to say to that, but I'll say Christian because that's what my mom named me and let's make her happy.
Andrea: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: They are important.
Andrea: I do believe so. It's like, okay, people.
Christian Sheerer: I agree. Yeah, yeah, there's a lot in a name, right? That's like a, you know, Yeah, that's like Shakespeare thing, right? Yeah.
Andrea: So I've really kind of made sure that our team now actually knows that no matter how difficult somebody's name is to pronounce, I will give them the phonetic, you know, pronunciation. So if they only say it that way, like the first 10 times, they will always remember to say it that way. So it's like, you know, I don't like to hear butchered names or whatever.
Christian Sheerer: So.
Andrea: All right, well, with that and on the ending on Shakespeare, it's a good way to go. Thanks. Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: I said that over. So yeah, let me know. And then in the meantime too, so you'll get set up. I have a couple calls coming up that I have to hop to, but I will send over a recap. Getnickel.com is going to be foolproof to get set up and get started, but I'll send over a recap of all the stuff that we chatted about and kind of pull out some key highlights that we should think through together before we get back together in a week. And if there's anything that comes up in your initial setup, I mean, don't hesitate. That's also a pet peeve of mine, even though I just did it. I always tell people, who am I to tell people not to hesitate? I'm here for you. But really don't worry about asking me a random question that comes up, troubleshoot thing, and if we have to set up some ad hoc time between now and them to help think through something free and open and do that. Sounds good.
Andrea: All right, thanks Christian.
Christian Sheerer: Have a great day. All right, thank you.
Andrea: Yeah, it was wonderful to meet you.
Christian Sheerer: Pleasure meeting you. Thank you.
