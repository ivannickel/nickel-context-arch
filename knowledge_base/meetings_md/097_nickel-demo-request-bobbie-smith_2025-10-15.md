Christian Sheerer: Hey, how's it going?
lifes: Good.
Christian Sheerer: Are you doing well? Staying busy? Can't complain.
lifes: Good. Close my door here. Okay.
Christian Sheerer: Okay. Yeah. I mean, best place for us to start, as I can kind of introduce to you. Nickel at a high level based on what you guys currently do for payments. So I understand it's like a full dentistry practice, right?
lifes: Yeah, we actually have two practices that we're running out of the same office.
Christian Sheerer: Oh, nice. Okay, cool. And so you're looking for, I guess, a change in payments for both of them or just one of them?
lifes: We have credit cards set up already. We're looking to get. Patients want to pay by electronic checks.
Christian Sheerer: Right now you want to get paid by electronic checks?
lifes: Patients want the option of paying by electronic checks if they can.
Christian Sheerer: Okay.
lifes: And.
Christian Sheerer: And how do they do it today? They just write checks. Physical ones?
lifes: Yes, physical ones. They use their credit card. They're getting charged a 3.5% service fee.
Christian Sheerer: Oh, wow. Okay. And that is via, like. So walk me through from start to finish. When they have to pay, you send them an invoice or something?
lifes: No, they pay day of service.
Christian Sheerer: How does it get collected? Are they just writing their information down or.
lifes: Well, I guess I'm not sure what your question is.
Christian Sheerer: So is there, like, a terminal or something?
lifes: Yep, we have a terminal. They pay by. They pay by credit card.
Christian Sheerer: Okay.
lifes: Get a lot of that. Or people are paying by cash or check right now to avoid the service charge.
Christian Sheerer: Okay. And they're just writing a check there on the spot.
lifes: Correct.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, cool. So what's wrong with that?
lifes: Patients want to be able to do electronic check versus a paper check because a lot of people do not have paper checks anymore.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, cool. Heard you. Yeah. We deal with a lot of companies who are sort of, like, graduating into, it's funny to say, like, 21st century. Right. And a lot of people who are kind of very comfortable with keeping the check option, but then they. They realize, oh, if we just give all the options to our. Our customers, their patients, whether they're, you know, regular customers of. Of whatever they're buying, makes it a lot easier for them. It, like, slows down processing time, slows down reconciliation time. So that's, like, sort of the main thing that we do, I think, is less kind of immediately flashy, but I think more important over time is like, the 10 to 12 hours that we save, like, having to forego driving checks to the bank or whatever. Right. And. And. And making it, like, kind of foolproof for. For customers, patient, whoever they are, to make payments in whatever way is easiest for them. And so we don't have a terminal per se. There's like ways that we can think through that. But the way that nickel got started was around kind of like we call it now, like America's core businesses, but is usually around the built world industry where we could handle large transactions pretty quickly and safely. Whereas like most electronic platforms were built for very small transactions. And that's why they charge kind of like a lot of in terms of fees. And so because we built it out that way, because our founder, he came from Stanley, Black and Decker, the other one came from Airbnb and they were like, oh, if we, if we just build out like a payments infrastructure that can handle these large payments, even companies that use small payments will be able to benefit from it. And so we don't have a terminal per se, but everything happens with a payment link and like an invoice. So are you guys like still creating some version of like an invoice or it's just uploaded into the terminal and then how does it get reconciled, I guess is the best way to frame that question.
lifes: We have a dental software, so we're manually putting in the payment ourselves. So our actual terminals are not integrated into our software right now. So we run our terminal, we do a batch at the end of the day, get our totals there, and we cross reference them with our dental software with what we manually entered in.
Christian Sheerer: And does the dental software act as like an erp, like an accounting software as well?
lifes: Yeah, we run reports after that. And that's what you mean?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, sort of like, you know, like a industry specific version of like a QuickBooks or something. If you're familiar.
lifes: It is not operating like QuickBooks. That's totally separate. So I can post checks, I can send patients, I can bill out of our software, I can give patients receipts, statements, all of that. That's what you mean?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. Do you guys use QuickBooks also?
lifes: We use QuickBooks for. Yes, Dr. Geiser does.
Christian Sheerer: Which one? Which, which version of QuickBooks is that?
lifes: We are have an online version.
Christian Sheerer: QuickBooks online. Cool.
lifes: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: The reason I ask is because that's the typical way that people get started with us, is they link up with QuickBooks and tip like, you know, vast majority are sending out invoices via QuickBooks and once that's linked up with nickel becomes very easy because it's a two way sync and then they send out that invoice. But I'm, I'm interested in the, in the, the dental software, the, you know, dentistry software and whether or Not. It doesn't sound like. So they're not integrated today. Kind of like the payments flow and the dentist dentistry software. Would that be kind of like a hard and fast requirement for us to link up into?
lifes: I guess I don't. I guess I don't understand your question. As far as linking up, are you looking at integrating into our system? No, no, no.
Christian Sheerer: Well, I was wondering if that was something that you were kind of like a cornerstone of your evaluation of, like, a new payments platform.
lifes: Well, we've talked about, like, being able to send patients a link to pay a bill if they want, or if they're here in office to pay a bill. They could do that.
Christian Sheerer: They already can today.
lifes: Not with us, they can't.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, okay, okay.
lifes: We don't. We do not have that availability. That's what we're looking at, too.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, cool. And so I'll show you kind of how Nicholas set up in the. In the majority of instances. And they'll be able. They'll save on. Our fees are 2.99 if they pay by a credit card, so save 0.6. I think that's meaningful over time. It's free for achievements. That's because we were able to build around these large transactions where if you did a $300,000 transaction, 1% of that is 3,000 already off the top. And each kind of payment link is tied to, like, a particular invoice or like a particular transaction. And so then I'll give that general instance of how it works, and then we can chat through kind of what the requirements are on your end, whether it necessarily needs to link with the dental software. Because if it does, something might be something that we could build out, but it would require a little bit more engineering leg work on our end, and we could scope that up together.
lifes: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: And so quick. So. So in your payments flow, where you set it up in all the transactions in the day and then you settle them, that's happening, I mean, for lack of a better word, sort of manually. Right. Like you're doing it, they're paying either they're sending a check, and then you kind of collect all of that, and then you push it into QuickBooks via some CSV or something.
lifes: It doesn't go into QuickBooks right away. That's something Dr. Geiser does, you know, later on when she reconciles. So right now we do, you know, because we get insurance checks. So we add up all those and we get our deposits together manually and drop them off at the bank.
Christian Sheerer: And then. Okay, I got you. Cool. So honestly, this might be even a little bit a shortening of that time too, because what people typically do is they come in, they create an account, right. And they, they set up their, and link their QuickBooks account. That happens in two minutes. You just have to select the right chart of accounts that you want linked up to this particular nickel instance. And you can also have multiple accounts within nickel and not have to log out if you guys link them together. If you want to have completely two separate accounts for both of the practices, totally fine as well. That might make it a little bit easier if, if you're tasked with, with managing both of them. Is that which one of those you think would be the way to do it?
lifes: Don't know yet. Need more information.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, cool. What, what would help, what would help make you understand that?
lifes: I guess I need, I, I am not even sure what I need to wrap my hound. Everything that you're talking about. So right now you're saying like, for us to make deposits, we were going to hook up with, we're going, everything's going right directly to QuickBooks right away.
Christian Sheerer: So that's, so that's usually, usually how people are, are, are creating it. Right. Because if you're creating an invoice in QuickBooks and then you want to send it out via a nickel payment link, that's the easiest way because we'll just automatically sync those together. You could always though, and this might be the way that you guys do it is like, okay, I have a new patient come in and I'm going to add them as a customer, put in their email address and I'll send it to me.
lifes: If we, honestly, if we have to run the payment system through QuickBooks, Dr. Geyser is not going to roll every single patient into QuickBooks that way.
Christian Sheerer: You don't have to.
lifes: Yeah, she just won't do that. And then we've got to worry about HIPAA compliance.
Christian Sheerer: Oh, it just peaked. Honestly piqued my interest because it, if, if you guys were, if all of them were in QuickBooks, then it would make that process a little bit easier. But you can, you don't have to integrate them. Really.
lifes: The only time they go into QuickBooks is if I need to refund them some money.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, cool. Yeah. And so what I'm showing you here is like absent QuickBooks, I'm just making an invoice and I'm going to store everything in nickel and I can just, we'll have a store of all of that information and all the transactions as well. Receipts that can get downloaded so that you can run your same process, make it a little bit quicker on the saving of time of, like, you know, writing a physical check. And then also save the patient some money on. On the credit card fees.
lifes: So if I have a patient that I'm checking out and they want to pay through a. Through electronically, I'd have to go into nickel, create an invoice for them, send it to them while they're here for them to pay it. Is that my understanding?
Christian Sheerer: Yep, you're right.
lifes: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: And so I'd create. So I'm creating this invoice for. For that checkup or whatever, whatever the amount is. If you have documents that you need to upload tied to it. Don't have to, but you can. If you have their payment method already, you can charge it automatically if they've, you know, given you debit authorization. Right. Something that says, hey, you know, life smiles can just take it away from us. Or if you want to just give them. This is the way. I don't know, 70, 30%, 70%. Just, you know, send out a link and I'll send it over. And so then that invoice is. Is open.
lifes: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: And so then I'll show you what it looks like on their end. So they. So I'm the customer now or the patient, and this is what they'll see. So it was instant. And they'll be able to do it before they leave. Technically, that. That this will just stay open until they pay it out.
lifes: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: You can set a particular due date. If they go past the due date, it'll become overdue, and then they'll be able to pay how they want by card or by ach.
lifes: So how does the. Does the link come up immediately after sending.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, I just sent this one.
lifes: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, I just sent this one 30 seconds ago.
lifes: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: And it came in. So you could really do. You could do it in the. They don't even have to leave the chair. Right. Okay. And they. They would get it and then they just put their card details in or their electronic check, like ach stuff in.
lifes: Okay. And then we would still manually have to enter that payment into our dental software like we're doing with the credit card payment.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. So let's say it's completed. Right. Let's say I paid all of this stuff out. That'll live here in transactions. It'll live in both places. You'll see the completed ones here in invoices. But also in transactions, you can also pay vendors. Right. So we have accounts payable too. But all the receivables will be here.
lifes: Okay. And is there a monthly fee for the services?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, it's 35amonth.
lifes: Okay. And that you guys do the credit cards and the ACH payments?
Christian Sheerer: Yep.
lifes: Okay. Can we do one and not the other?
Christian Sheerer: Why would you do one of it, not the other?
lifes: I need to check to see if we're under contract right now with our current company.
Christian Sheerer: Oh, is it a. It's like a point of service thing we have.
lifes: We don't have anything for electronic checks, but we are set up with. With merchant. A merchant to run our credit cards right now.
Christian Sheerer: Cool. Yeah, it should be pretty easy to get out of, but yeah, you could always. You could always run one, not the other.
lifes: The 2.99. That. Can we pass it on to our patient?
Christian Sheerer: Yep.
lifes: Okay. And what about share it if you.
Christian Sheerer: Want, but it's defaulted to pass it over to them.
lifes: Okay. And what about health savings accounts?
Christian Sheerer: Is that any issues there with those Health savings Accounts?
lifes: Yeah, like an HSA card?
Christian Sheerer: You know, that's a good question because we don't typically get too many medical professionals. I don't think it should be okay. But I. Let me just triple check.
lifes: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, do. What is the merchant service provider?
lifes: It's Kibo.
Christian Sheerer: Kibo. Is that with a cube with a K. Okay, cool. And they don't run the terminals, do they? They're just like. They're just help you organize the credit card stuff.
lifes: They're. We have. We got the terminals from them. That's what your question.
Christian Sheerer: Oh, you did?
lifes: Yeah, we got everything from them.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, cool. Awesome. Yeah. So it sounds like for like, kind of the immediate way we would slot in is those people doing the ACH initially and then over time, or if it's easy to get out of the Kibo situation. The thing is about. Right. So about the terminal is like, that might be a big shakeup if you move away from the terminal. Right. This is simple.
lifes: Okay. So to do credit card. How do we process credit cards with you guys then? Do we have like a terminal here that we're running or is everything through the software?
Christian Sheerer: It's all through here.
lifes: Even the credit cards are.
Christian Sheerer: Yep. We don't have a physical. Yeah, we don't have a physical terminal that we would send to you. You could. So we have what's called like a payment portal. You could turn this into like a QR code. So this is one of our customers, and they have like a payment portal live at their site that people can just go and pay. Honestly, really, whenever Like, I could send them a thousand bucks right now.
lifes: And.
Christian Sheerer: They make the payment.
lifes: So the one thing I need to look into is, like, the HIPAA compliance, like, going through a third party.
Christian Sheerer: What did. What did Kibo have to do for HIPAA compliance?
lifes: They're not hooked up into our system at all. They're not locked into our software. But if I have to bill somebody through your software, then I'm. I'm sending out patient information. I have patient information in another website, another portal.
Christian Sheerer: So. Oh, Kibo doesn't collect any payment. They don't collect card information.
lifes: But it's not linked into our software. It's totally separate.
Christian Sheerer: We wouldn't be linked into your software.
lifes: But I have to give you information. That's my. That's what I just don't know about.
Christian Sheerer: Okay. Yeah.
lifes: Especially if there's an invoice there. It talks about all the services that were done, you know, that sort of thing.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. I mean, so the. The minimum amount of information that we need, you don't need to create, like, an invoice that is, you know, detailed with us, but the minimum amount of information that we need is. Is an email and. And, like, sort of the name of the customer. Right. It could be a number of a person, but, yeah, we do need their contact because then we wouldn't be able to, you know, send them stuff.
lifes: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: And go ahead.
lifes: Do you. Do you work with any other medical facilities?
Christian Sheerer: We work with medical tech providers quite extensively. Like, there are a couple big customers of ours who use a lot of payment volume every month, year, who are selling. And every time I've gone into a conversation with them, like, HIPAA compliance comes up. But they are selling, like, two. Two doctors. Like, think of, I don't know, the dentistry equipment. Right. It's those types of providers that we're using.
lifes: Okay, so up front, you guys are doing $35 a month. There's no charges for the ACH payments, and you take 2.99 on all credit cards.
Christian Sheerer: That's correct, yeah.
lifes: Okay. Are there any setup fees?
Christian Sheerer: No. And it really should take, like, two hours to set up in the way that we've described it. Okay, but if you wanted to link up to the dentistry software, I can't promise that we would even take on that project because it would sort of be a custom one with us. But if we did want to do it and we scoped it out, there would probably be some charge because of, you know, the engineering kind of investment we'd have to make.
lifes: When you say that, does that mean you guys could integrate into our software? Is that what you mean by that?
Christian Sheerer: I mean, we're. Yeah, we're super talented team of developers who can integrate pretty much anything that has like a, like coherent documentation around it. But we would have to evaluate kind of like the, the return on that investment for us, and then that, that. That would be the only instance and where there is a setup charge. But in the 99 of instances of people just signing up to use us, there isn't so much.
lifes: Okay. Okay, well, I think I've got enough information. I will talk to Dr. Geisler and then see what she wants to do. And if it's something she's interested in, I will circle back with you.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. When do you. When do you think you're going to have that conversation with her?
lifes: All depends if she comes in on Friday or not. So I hope to know something by the end of this week.
Christian Sheerer: Did you want to set up maybe a tentative time for early next week? If you're able to have that conversation, then we could download and if we need to move it, we can move it. But just so I am able to prioritize, y', all.
lifes: Do you have a contact number that I can reach out to?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, I mean, have my number and I'll. I'll follow this up with an email, so you can.
lifes: Okay, let's do that. And then I. I have to look at the schedule to see when we have open time for myself, so.
Christian Sheerer: Cool.
lifes: Yeah. Okay. Yeah, give me an email and I'll talk to her and then we'll. I'll let you know either way what she's thinking or if she.
Christian Sheerer: I'm sure she'll have more questions, but yeah, and if. I mean, I'm happy to make time around her schedule too, if she wants to hop on directly and we can chat through kind of all those different things too.
lifes: Okay, that sounds.
Christian Sheerer: Both practices.
lifes: Yes, we've got a general dental practice and she's also operating an airway clinic. Nice dental office.
Christian Sheerer: So awesome. So it would be. Yeah. Okay. That just helps me prepare if. If we do keep the conversation rolling, like how we might particularize, like you guys's nickel setup if you have two accounts under the same account or two separate ones or however we want to do it. And only the dental. The only the dental clinic uses QuickBooks or the only the airway one does.
lifes: Everything's on QuickBooks books for Oliver County. Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, cool. Nice. Can I get a sense of what you guys do, like, monthly, volume wise?
lifes: I'm gonna say I was on medically for a little while. I've been meaning to look at our numbers and reports.
Christian Sheerer: Oh, you're good.
lifes: Bet you're looking at anywhere between 150 and 250amonth.
Christian Sheerer: Okay. Across both of them together.
lifes: Yeah. In production.
Christian Sheerer: And is that pretty evenly split on the who people on Teboo versus physical check?
lifes: I'd have to research that because we have not been with Kibo that long.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, cool.
lifes: I have not researched that much.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, yeah, no worries. And when did you guys get set up with Kivo? Just if I'm curious, Probably this spring. In the spring. Okay.
lifes: Yeah. Again, I'd have to look back.
Christian Sheerer: No worries. I think that's might be when I give you my recap of everything. That might be just some things that I call out as homework for you just before we get back together again.
lifes: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: Because then that'll give us a good sense of, like, where your guys's kind of priorities break down on. On being able to. To service. And I'll do some research on Kibo and see if there's like. Or if. Or if you want to pull it up to. Because I know you mentioned that would be something you have to look at if you wanted to save the 0.6 for the customers paying by card, what your kind of commitment to them is. Okay, cool.
lifes: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: No worries. Oh, yeah. So I'll get that over to you in a couple of minutes here. I have a call in four minutes.
lifes: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: So probably after that, I get you a good recap and spell out some next steps for us, and then hopefully we can get back together, like, Monday or Tuesday next week. If Dr. Geisler, you said yes, Geisler is interested. Yeah, I think. I think it'll be pretty easy to slot in. And I think typically it's around, you know, a couple days that you save every month. I'm just, like, literally not having to drive checks to the bank. Right. And the reconciling time of that.
lifes: Okay, that sounds good.
Christian Sheerer: Cool. Okay. Yeah. You'll hear from me soon.
lifes: Okay, thanks. Have a good day.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, you too.
lifes: Bye.
Christian Sheerer: Bye.
