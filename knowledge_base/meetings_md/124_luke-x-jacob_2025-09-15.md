Jacob Greenberg: Hey Luke, can you hear me okay?
Luke Holding: All right, I heard you. Can you hear me now?
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, I can hear you now. How's it going?
Luke Holding: Good, how are you?
Jacob Greenberg: Good. So yeah, I have 30 minutes, I actually have an hour booked for us today, but I think we're only going to be half an hour. Does that work for you?
Luke Holding: Yeah, if we could keep it to a half an hour, that'd be great.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, we could definitely keep it to half an hour. Yes, so the purpose of this call is just to touch base and to get you set up with your free account. I'll walk you through some of the basics. I understand that kind of where we left it last time was this does seem like it'll be a fit for you. The only concern you had was bandwidth. You've got a lot of profits on your plate right now. So really the purpose of this call is just to set you up with the account. Have you create it, walk you through the basics of what you're going to need to do to get going so that once you get some bigger deals and need to use a solution like this a little more, you have it in your back pocket, you don't need to set it up last minute. Does that sound all right?
Luke Holding: Yes, sir.
Jacob Greenberg: Awesome. Okay, great. So first things first is I'm just going to guide you through account creation. If you'd like to share your screen, it'd be helpful. If not, I could just walk you through verbally. But if you're on Zoom, the share button is going to be the green arrow in the center at the bottom of the screen. Yeah.
Luke Holding: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: Great. So I would go to www.getnipple.com.
Luke Holding: And. I K E L and I C. K E L. You.
Jacob Greenberg: Can go ahead and click get started up there. And enter your company information. All righty. All right, so you can either start by connecting the QuickBooks account or by connecting your bank account. But both, those are pretty much the two big steps here to get to going. And then I'll walk you through a test transaction if you'd like. So business account, you could click that and it's going to prompt you to sync with plaid for verification, which makes it a little bit easier.
Luke Holding: Probably be best to try to connect with QuickBooks. Cool.
Jacob Greenberg: So then if you want to start with QuickBooks, click explore nickel to exit out of the screen and then go to the account settings tab on the lower left hand side of the screen over there.
Luke Holding: Account settings.
Jacob Greenberg: Yep. And then go over to the integrations button on the far right. And then click Link QuickBooks.
Luke Holding: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: There you go. Now, on your first time syncing QuickBooks, it does take a few minutes, but depending on how much information you have for it to actually show with a nickel. So this can be anywhere from like two to 10 minutes, but that's just the first time. That's just today. Afterwards, once you start transacting, it'll be an automatic instantaneous sync. For all of your transactions. So now if you want to click into general really quickly, I'm just going to show you a few things here. You don't have to do it right now, but I want to walk you through them. This is where you would update your branding and your logo. So you'd update your logo there and you could put a banner. So this banner will show up whenever you send your invoice or whenever anybody's going to pay via your payments portal and pretty much anything coming to and from Nikkel. So this is where you can kind of customize what your customers are seeing. Okay, now click on the members tab. Here you'll be able to add other administrators that you want, or you can give them different types of access. So if you have an accounting person or someone just on the AR team or someone just on the AP team, you can invite their email address and give them access with the QuickBooks, with the Nikkel core program. Which are currently signed up on for free, you can have up to three different users, including yourself. So without having to upgrade, you can have three different seats. And if you pop into the notifications tab really quickly, this is where you can customize what notifications are being sent to your customers or to the vendors you're working with or to your internal team. So, like, whenever anybody opens a link or if they send a payment, you get to customize what you're getting notified on. So this is a nice place to play around for your internal customizations. And besides that, when you're ready to upgrade to the $35 a month plan, which does have a one month free trial period, you just click on the plans button to the left of notifications over there, and you'll be able to upgrade from there if you'd like. Okay, whenever you're ready to do that, it's 14 days, excuse me. This would give you one day faster turnaround times for both credit card and for AE. It's still unlimited pre-AE for plan you're on. It also opens up unlimited amount of seats and it enables you to have an unlimited per transaction limit. So on the core plan, which you're currently on, it's going to cap you at $25,000 per transaction. When you upgrade, you could do several million per transaction.
Luke Holding: Want to. Gotcha.
Jacob Greenberg: And then let's see. So now you could scroll up. Let's go into general real quick. One more time. Or, excuse me, get paid now on from this page, you'd be able to update essentially your nickel wide preferences. So if you're going to pass the credit card costs on to the customer, 100%. You keep this here. If you want to customize that, you can. If you want to enable or disable credit cards, you can if you upgrade your plan. Now, once you go ahead and scroll down a little bit on the payment method, you can add your bank account here so that you can connect your payment method. That's the last step to getting ready to begin the process. So how do you use flab before?
Luke Holding: You have I used what?
Jacob Greenberg: It's called flab. P-L-A-I-D. It's a banking verification. It's, like, very standard. I don't.
Luke Holding: I don't think so.
Jacob Greenberg: So I'll show you what it looks like. You just click add business information and payout method. We don't have to complete it today if you don't want to, but once you do click your. Click to link your bank account right there. It's going to open Plaid and now you enter your information and phone number and it's going to populate once you enter your phone number, it'll populate a screen with a bunch of different banks. You just pick the bank that you currently are banking with. This way it's like a two-step verification and this way you're able to more securely link your bank account and log directly in from your bank account. To create that thing.
Luke Holding: Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: Exactly.
Luke Holding: Yeah, makes sense.
Jacob Greenberg: Yep. So I know that you said you were hoping to use nickel for larger jobs, but also, you know, any job, you'll be able to save a little bit of money and get some transactions out of them. Do you think that there are any test transactions coming up within September that would make sense testing? The reason I ask is typically we like to before you have a big job, do one or two test transactions on the platform so you're comfortable with it and everything settles.
Luke Holding: I do have a job coming up. It'll probably be next month.
Jacob Greenberg: Any test transactions you'd be able to do before that job comes up?
Luke Holding: Maybe on Friday, I've got a little job on Friday that I'm going to do.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, great. Yeah, a smaller job would be a great test transaction. This is really just so that, you know, I could alert my team that you're going to be activating, make sure it goes smoothly the first time. Once you get everything synced the first time and you have a test transaction and you're familiar with the platform, it should be smooth sailing from there.
Luke Holding: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: So I can let my team know that either this Friday or early next week, you're looking to do a couple of test transactions and I'll just keep them in the loop.
Luke Holding: Okay, sounds good.
Jacob Greenberg: And if you exit out of this and yeah, you'll need to do this before your test transaction, just so you know. Go ahead and go to the get paid section really quickly on the left hand navigation bar.
Luke Holding: Good day. Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: So this is where you have to click your chart of accounts. So this would be a subcategory of your QuickBooks. So you'll see here, these should all be things that are showing from your QuickBooks account.
Luke Holding: Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: The one you want to sync or however many you want to sync, and then it would start to populate under, you know, invoices or built in. So, yep, once you click set up, this is the process that usually takes a few minutes to get it going. Go ahead and click complete set up. If it looks good, there we go. Okay, so now you're synced with QuickBooks. Whenever a new invoice is populated from within that page within QuickBooks, it will automatically show within Nickel. And whenever one of these are paid from Nickel, it'll automatically settle within your QuickBooks account. And it'll move from this active tab over to the completed tab, which you'll find on the top next to active. And if you schedule new invoices for the future, they'll be found under that scheduled tab right there. If you go ahead and click the, you see the payments portal hyperlink on the top right there? It's kind of like a purple color. So, oh, I guess you need to set the bank account up before this happens. But this will essentially be, I encourage you to check that out once you set up your bank account. What's going to happen is this will be like more of a generic payment portal that you could plug in. We have some customers that on their website, there will be a button just to pay invoice. People can go there, click it, and it'll be branded to, you know, holding construction company. Whatever branding and logos, et cetera, you want to include. And it's just like an easier, more generic payment portal that some people will embed on their website.
Luke Holding: It's a nice little backup thing to have.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. Yeah, that's pretty much the basic walkthrough. It takes a second to set up. So I would encourage sometime this week before Friday, syncing your bank account, making sure that everything runs smoothly there, and then doing the test transaction on Friday or sometime next week so that by.
Luke Holding: The time your job comes up in. October,
Jacob Greenberg: it'll be smooth sailing. Okay. All right, cool. Do you have any questions? How are you feeling with the platform so far?
Luke Holding: I mean, it seems pretty self-explanatory for the most part.
Jacob Greenberg: Awesome. Okay, cool. Are you excited to start using it? Do you have any hesitations that you want me to address?
Luke Holding: Not really, no hesitations.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay. All right, well, awesome. In the meantime, over the next couple of weeks, if you start your test transactions, I'll do a check-in with you. I'll let my team know that you're expecting to do it Friday or early next week. I'll check in with you sometime later next week to make sure it went okay.
Luke Holding: And if you have any questions in.
Jacob Greenberg: The meantime, don't hesitate to shoot me an email. I'll be quick to respond. Okay.
Luke Holding: All right, Luke. All right, cool.
Jacob Greenberg: Well, that was even faster than half an hour, so I'll give you some time. Awesome,
Luke Holding: man. Awesome. All right, cool. Happy we can connect and yeah, let. Me know if you need any more support.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, we'll do.
Luke Holding: All right, have a good day. All right, you too. Thanks.
