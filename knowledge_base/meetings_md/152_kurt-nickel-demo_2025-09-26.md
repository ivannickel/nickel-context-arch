Participant 2: Daring.
iPhone: Looks like you're on mute.
Participant 2: Oh, hey.
Jacob Greenberg: Can you hear me?
Participant 2: Yep.
iPhone: Can you hear me?
Jacob Greenberg: I can hear you now. How's it going, Kurt?
iPhone: Good, good.
Participant 2: Neil? Good.
Jacob Greenberg: Good. I'm happy we can make some time to connect today.
iPhone: Yeah, me too.
Participant 2: Awesome.
Jacob Greenberg: So I actually have a full hour on the calendar for us right now. Typically, these usually take around 30 minutes. Is that time framework okay for you?
iPhone: Yeah, the 30 minutes is fine. I know it was kind of a 10 minute, and then if it was good, then we kept you.
Participant 2: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah. So typically, what I like to do for the agenda for these calls is like, learn a little bit more about your business, why you're interested in learning more about nickel. To begin with, I'll ask some questions to better understand what your current processes are, and then I'll spend some time showing you a demonstration that's unique and custom to your environment and some background on nickel. Does that sound fair?
Participant 2: Fair. Yep.
Jacob Greenberg: Awesome. So, yeah, give me some background on your business. I know that you have Spartan drilling tools as well as an M I n C O N D T email address.
iPhone: So I actually have five businesses. Spartan Drill Tools is a manufacturing company. We build drill pipe and drill tools. I've got an auction company called Sell Auction, a printing company called Incan Online, a storage company, cleaning company. Was really just kind of curious, want to get the high level on nickel, see if it was a fit for any one of those companies. And then I presented over there to the managers.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, sure. I think it might take a little bit of time to discover what's going on at each of these businesses, but can you walk me through your current process? Are all the businesses different as far as what type of payment methods you're typically receiving?
iPhone: I mean, yeah. So the auction company is typically wires, achs, and credit card. Okay. The manufacturing company is pretty much all checks and achs. The printing company is mostly all credit cards. The storage company is all reoccurring. Reoccurring credit card charges. And then this, the cleaning company is just credit. Check. Sorry.
Participant 2: Gotcha.
Jacob Greenberg: All right, let me give you a quick background about how nickel came into existence so that you could understand how we might be able to apply to all these businesses. But really what we do is we were founded by the previous director of innovation at Stanley, Black and Decker, initially built for Built World Industries. So construction and contracting companies, mostly because these companies are businesses that cash flow is really important to them. And there's a lot of cash flow challenges in these organizations. So what we ended up doing was building a Tool that is free to access on a basic level, offers free unlimited ACH so that no one's getting nickel and dime to death. And essentially the purpose of it was to make receiving any type of payment, whether it's ach, check, credit card, fast and free for businesses and, and enabling their customers to be able to pay in whichever way they prefer, but without that damaging the bottom line of the businesses that they're paying or the settlement times as well. So we started with Built World Industries because there's a big cash flow problem there. But we really quickly realized that nickel is applicable to a ton of different businesses. We've had accounting firms reaching out, had many cleaning companies reaching out. I haven't worked with an auction company yet, but we've worked with whole gambit of businesses that need to schedule recurring charges more easily that are transferring from check to ach, looking for affordable and easy options to do it, or companies that are just looking for better cost from using QuickBooks for example. That's the background of nickel in a nutshell. Really quickly, are all of your companies using the same type of accounting system and similar tech stacks or are they all different?
iPhone: So the majority of them on the base level accounting use QuickBooks. Some of them are go using a GoDaddy platform.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay.
iPhone: But most of them use QuickBooks.
Participant 2: Okay. Yep, go for it.
iPhone: Sorry. Storage. Storage uses Square. Oh my God.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. Okay, so the storage company is all recurring credit cards and they're using square to process those credit cards.
Participant 2: Correct.
iPhone: That's.
Jacob Greenberg: I mean do you know what your annual revenue is for that storage company business?
iPhone: Roughly about $60,000. We just increased it. So it'll go up another $12,000 a year. So $72,000.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, gotcha. You're likely spending about 3% on fees at that business. I could tell you off the bat.
iPhone: Correct?
Participant 2: Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, so we can eradicate like that's the low hanging fruit here is we could just eradicate that.
iPhone: So.
Jacob Greenberg: How.
iPhone: Where do those fees go? Like you guys just not charge fees or does the customer pay them? What's the.
Jacob Greenberg: So the truth is a lot of these merchant processors, their business model is just to honestly nickel and dime and gradually increase the prices for ACH and for credit card. For us, what we do since the core industries that we work with are typically construction and contracting which have larger payment structures. So the technology we developed is to be able to handle larger transactions. We can handle small transactions to just fine. But we're also able to handle 500,000 to million dollar transactions and up on a one to one settlement ratio. And that's just because of the technology that we built. Other merchant services providers, like if you get a 50,000 or 20,000 or $100,000 transaction, they're going to pause it for like a week and a half to review it before it's approved and then they're dispatch that to your bank account and like 10 different smaller incremental payments. It's just they're not built to handle that type of transaction. But because we are. So we keep the entire credit card fee when your customer does a left to pay by credit card. And what we found is when you offer both credit card and ACH clearly to the companies that you work with, especially for contracting, construction, built world industries, roughly 17 to 22% of the time, the end customer making the payment prefers to pay by credit card because it provides a cash flow advantage for them. They get to extend how long it takes for, for them to pay that back. And Most people have 2 to 3% cash back business cards at this point anyway. So it just, it doesn't actually cost them any more based on their credit cards and it gives them a cash flow advantage for their business. So we, that's where our revenue comes from. We don't look to make revenue from ach. We think that that should be free and easy. To be transparent with you, it costs us a couple cents for each transaction that people do on ach, but it's worth it for us to be able to offer that to customers for free. And in the future what we hope to do is offer other products that improve cash flow advantages for businesses that would be optional add ons. So we're looking at doing trade credit, more complex net term agreement, contracting as like add on products, stuff like that. Does that make sense as far as like our business model, why we're able to support that?
Participant 2: I mean.
iPhone: Yeah, you can. If you guys can support it that way.
Participant 2: Great.
Jacob Greenberg: Cool. All right, awesome. So I mean for the storage company, seems like that's one of your newer companies and you guys are growing 12 or 12K. You're looking at year over year, paying about 3% with square year over year. That's an easy fix for us. Let's see, the cleaning company is mostly check.
Participant 2: Yeah. Are you.
Jacob Greenberg: And manufacturing is mostly check with a little achievement.
Participant 2: Correct.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. Or do you have an initiative to move from check to ACH for any of these guys?
iPhone: We've tried in the past and a lot of them push back a little bit and I think it's more a Cash flow issue. Right. They want that extra week or 14 days for the check to show up.
Participant 2: Yeah.
iPhone: Which is. Honestly, it's fine because nobody is really over much over 30 days, so.
Participant 2: Okay. Okay with it. Cool.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah. So what nickel will do in these situations is just make it easier to keep track of all these payments. Whether they're paying by credit card or ACH or however the payment happens, it's easier to settle, and it just gives the customer a better, more organized option for paying. I'll show you what it looks like as far as. Can you give me a quick breakdown for the auction company, manufacturing, printing and cleaning, typical transaction size and, like, typical, typical revenue that you guys are seeing?
iPhone: Yeah. So, I mean, on the manufacturing company, we do about $2.5 million. On the auction side, we do about $1.2 million.
Participant 2: Okay.
iPhone: Printing and cleaning, printing company, we're working on an acquisition right now. If it goes through, we should be on Track for about $2 million there. The cleaning is small. We have one big contract, and we do about $70,000 a year there.
Jacob Greenberg: Now for the manufacturing company, you're already accepting ACHs at this point. How are you collecting ACHS for the auction and manufacturing companies?
iPhone: So the auction company, we just go through QuickBooks, which is a pain because they tend to hold things for longer than I would like.
Participant 2: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: You know what your fees are on QuickBooks right now? I know it's different for different customers.
iPhone: I think it's 1%.
Participant 2: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: And you said it. You were. Sorry, I interrupted you. You said it's a pain because they're holding things for longer than you'd like.
iPhone: Yeah. When they're larger transactions. So anything over about $75,000, then they hold it for seven days.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha.
Participant 2: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay. So what I was saying before must have resonated with you pretty directly.
Participant 2: Yep. Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: Is that the same with the manufacturing company as well?
iPhone: No. So we use bank of America there. They don't actually charge us any fees for ach.
Participant 2: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: And you're making payments for accounts payable using bank of America as well?
iPhone: Yes.
Participant 2: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: We do have a. So where we're going to save you the most amount of money is going to be on accounts receivable. But where we might save you even more time, an organization is going to be on accounts payable as well. So I'll quickly show you that before the end of this call.
iPhone: So would we send invoices from Nickel then through your platform?
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah. Here, let me. How about I open this up and show you what it looks like?
Participant 2: A little bit.
Jacob Greenberg: My last question would be, I know for the auction company you're getting 1% ACH fees from QuickBooks. You're sending out all the payments for requests through QuickBooks. Do you know what your split is for ACH first credit card for payments. Because I know you said you're collecting some credit card payments on the auction company.
iPhone: Yeah, I think they're at like 3% or something like that for the credit cards.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. Do you know how like in an estimate, how many of the transactions you receive rach versus credit card?
iPhone: The majority are actually wires. We've tried actually to move kind of away from ACH and credit card on smaller stuff is okay, but anything over about $5,000, we don't take credit cards.
Jacob Greenberg: And that's because of fees or another reason.
iPhone: It's because of fees, but also because people can go back and back charge or whatever. Yeah, chargebacks.
Participant 2: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: I'll show you how we take care of chargebacks as well.
Participant 2: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: Give me one second. I'm just going to open this environment. Okay. So can you see my screen here?
Participant 2: Yep.
Jacob Greenberg: So this would be within the nickel platform. Now I just want to call out quickly. One thing that we could do is we could sign you up for what's called a master account. This way you could have a clients tab or business tab. You'll be able to manage all of your different businesses from within here.
iPhone: Right.
Jacob Greenberg: So you'll be able to have access to the manufacturing company, the auction company, etc. And when you click Go to account, you're just going to go to that individual account and you can pick it from the dropdown makes it easy for coordination sake. Now when you start to populate some information in here, this is going to be a high level summary of your transactions over the past couple days. For a deeper dive into transactions and an overview, you're going to click on this transactions tab on the right hand side and now you're going to be able to see all the transactions that you've had, where they're coming from, going to the amount and their status. You can click into this to reconcile or flag any transactions. You can download it by CSV and we make it really easy to sort and filter through your transactions. It's just a little bit more convenient than the way that QuickBooks is built. However, the first thing that you do when you pop into nickel and you set it up is you're going to go into the Integrations tab and link your QuickBooks. Depending on how much QuickBooks data you have this will take anywhere between like three and six minutes. But once it's completed, every transaction that you create within QuickBooks, every invoice you create within QuickBooks, and every invoice you get settled with a nickel, are going to automatically populate with each other. So if you create an invoice in QuickBooks right now, that's your typical process. You can keep doing that if you like. It's just going to populate right here in the Transaction tab on Get Paid under Invoices. This is where you'll live for Accounts Receivable. It'll just populate right here automatically. And you could just click Request Payment. You could do as many as you want, filter for all the unsent invoices and you can send them all out at the same time. Makes it a little bit easier.
Participant 2: Yep.
Jacob Greenberg: Before I dive into what it looks like to receive one of these invoices, which I'm going to show you momentarily, and to collect customer information in advance should you want to auto charge them, just going to show you this Easter egg really quick. When you get nickel, you get your own portal here. So this will have your company name.nickelpayments.com all of this branding is updated from go to account settings and you could update your logo and your banner. And this is going to be your own brand. And this will link back to your website. So a lot of our customers will link this on their website. So I was just working with these guys the other day. They'll have this payments tab here and then you can just make a payment to them. And this form is customizable, so whatever type of information you need to collect that's relevant for each different type of business, you can customize the fields.
Participant 2: Okay.
iPhone: So we could put in their invoice number or any of that kind of stuff, right?
Jacob Greenberg: Exactly. So this is more of like a generic catch all. If someone wants to just go on your website and make a payment via credit card or ach really quickly, they can do this here. And they're required to enter their full name and their email contact information on the next slide. So you get to capture that no matter what. But this is more for general catch all people want to go online, make a payment on their own. If you are sending out individual invoices, I'll show you what it looks like. So I'm going to create a test one for us right here. Real quick. I'm going to put my email address so I can show you what it looks like to receive it. Now, all this information will be populated based on your QuickBooks invoice already. So this will have already been generated. If you will be using QuickBooks, I'm just going to show you for our purposes today. Now you can set a one time or a recurring payment. If you select a recurring payment, you would pick the cadence every week, quarter, year or month, the start date and the end date. And what we'll populate is an overview preview of when these payments will be scheduled for. Today I'm going to do just a one time payment. Notes for customers can go here and you can upload any documents you want to live on this transaction in this invoice in the portal that you create for your customer. But automatically the PDF line item invoice from QuickBooks will be automatically attached to it. You'll also be able to. Let's see, I have a sample invoice. For some reason it's always the hardest thing to find on my computer when I need it.
Participant 2: Oh well.
Jacob Greenberg: Well, you can attach any documents you want here. So if you have net terms agreements with your customers, if you have photos of the item that they purchased for auction, you could add any communications here. So it's consolidated. Do you guys. You said you typically do 30 day net terms?
iPhone: Yeah, on the drill pipe company we do.
Participant 2: And.
iPhone: As well.
Jacob Greenberg: Will you say that one more time.
iPhone: The printing company also has net 30.
Participant 2: Okay, gotcha.
Jacob Greenberg: You'd be able to set that due date here for when it's due. Set a reminder and you could add a netterm contract in the upload documents.
Participant 2: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: Now on the advanced tab, if you want to, you can disable credit card payments. Pretty much every customer keeps this enabled because you offer the ability to pay for free with ach or should they choose, they could pay with credit card but they keep the fees. You can also allow customers to edit the payment amount. So if you wanted to send one invoice where they pay incrementally, they make a deposit and then pay the balance later, or say it is one of your larger transactions that you're getting charged 1% on in QuickBooks and they hold for seven days. This enables your customer to say hey, I want to pay half of this in credit card, half of it in ach. I'll get some points out of it. They're able to do that on their own.
Participant 2: Yep.
Jacob Greenberg: Again, this is customizable and it's up to your preference. You can change the preference per invoice or you could set it as a universal preference for your company so that every time an invoice is sent out. It has those preferences set now created the invoice. You'll see here that I could actually charge the payment method on file. So do you have customer information for banking already stored in your QuickBooks for some of these businesses?
iPhone: Yeah, we do on the storage. It's all stored square though so they would need to re enter their information. I don't have any of that stuff.
Jacob Greenberg: It's pretty easy to export that and import that either into QuickBooks which will then sync to here or square at least.
Participant 2: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: But yeah, if you wanted to you could schedule a payment so that if you have your customer information you can add it manually. You could also request for them to add it on their own and I'll show you what that workflow looks like. It's one of my favorite things about nickel but you can charge the payment automatically on a certain date or you can send out the invoice. So you can send it by text or by email.
Participant 2: Or both.
Jacob Greenberg: I just sent it to my own email here. So here we see. This will be the company name in my demo environment it says degrad distribution. So this will be your logo and your company name. If you click on it, it goes straight to your main website and I'll say you have a payment request, the amount and the due date, who it's from, the invoice number, high level memo notes. Any attachments like the invoice will be attached to this email. And when you click Pay now you're brought to this unique portal that will have your branding and your logo, your company name and your name, the invoice number and the amount. You'll see that the customer can decide to pay with no fees by bank of any size transactions and it will take one or two days to settle no matter what. Or they can elect to pay by card and incur the 2.99 fee on their own here.
iPhone: So do you find, do you find that. I mean does that discourage customers when they realize there's another feet or are.
Jacob Greenberg: They when they realize there's a fee for credit card? Yeah, I think more less so than discouraging customers to make payments on credit card. I think it encourages customers to know that they have the ability to pay for free if they want to. I think there are certain circumstances where more and we find it. It's more common with industrial companies would prefer to pay with credit card to get a better cash flow advantage. Right. And then you know they can also. The other great thing here is they could customize that the amount so if they want to pay 20,000 by bank and put the rest on the card, they're able to do that really quickly. Did that answer your question?
iPhone: Yep.
Participant 2: Okay, cool. Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: Once that payment's made, you come into invoices and it will be automatically marked in nickel as completed. It will also be marked in QuickBooks automatically as reconciled and completed. Be able to see all the ones that are paid and you can see any schedule for the future. So you can schedule invoices to go out at a certain time. You can also create recurring invoices. Now, when you click on recurring invoices, you'll see you'll be able to create a new one down here. And you can also manage your existing recurring invoices right here. So if you have several customers that pay a certain amount of money on every specific day of the month, you can manage it here and you can see the previous transactions that they've had here. I know we're kind of running up on time. I have a couple other features that I wanted to show you if I have your permission to go a couple minutes over.
iPhone: Yep, that's fine.
Participant 2: Awesome. Okay, great.
Jacob Greenberg: But so far what I'm showing you, is there anything that stands out that might be like more useful or less useful for any one of your businesses?
iPhone: I mean, it makes sense for all of them.
Participant 2: Honestly, yeah.
iPhone: Seems like a little bit simpler platform we're currently doing.
Participant 2: Honestly, yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: And I think that one of the confusing things that we have when Zach's reaching out to people is, you know, we say, hey, we're going to say 5 to 15 hours of work a week and 3% of your revenue. And they're like, okay, that sounds great, but this is going to take five months to implement, isn't it? You know, and they get bogged down by that. Oh, we don't have time right now. The cool thing about nickel is if you do have QuickBooks, it's guaranteed to save you time, guaranteed to save you money. And it's really a one day implementation. You know, it's. I could have a phone call with you and whoever else on your team. We could set up specific permissions which I do want to go over really quick. And we can have you up and running by the end of the day and saving 1 to 3% for all of your transactions. One cool thing here, since you do have several different companies that you might want to have layered. Do you guys have different accounts receivable and payable people or accountants for each company? Is it one person that does it for everybody?
iPhone: No, we have different ones.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. So what you would do is you layer your account so each company has their own Nickel account, but they'd all roll up into a master account that you have visibility into. And you can invite members and give them custom access so you can assign a manager or an administrator or just a member so that you can control what type of processes they have visibility to and what type of numbers they have visibility into. And on the bill pay side, I just want to show you a workflow really quick. You can have it so that your your accounts payable teams at each company you can have one person submitting the payments or scheduling them in advance and you can have another person going through and approving or denying them. If you want to give that level of management ability, you can within nickel. The cool thing here is that all of your bill pay stuff is going to live next to your get paid stuff. And instead of having to, you know, currently it seems like you guys are assuming, whether intended or not, the PCI compliance liability for processing all of your vendor and customer card information by holding it in QuickBooks manually. So nickel takes care of all of that for you. For both get get paid sections and bill pay sections, all of your customers and your vendors, we ensure PCI compliance. The information lives within Nickel. You can request customer information from Nickel and you guys never have to worry about PCI compliance again. We're also SOC 2 compliant with the same standards as banking industries and we have, you know, quarterly reviews of this. So very secure. Let me see show you really quickly how you can request customer or vendor payment information. So right here you can add a customer payment method manually by entering it, or you could request it from the customer. So for larger companies, at the beginning of if you're going to be working with the same customer or have recurring payments, you'll say, hey, please update your banking information on record. And you'll get an email saying this company wants to save your payment method on file. Here's a quick overview of you know, this auction company wants to save your payment method on file. Or this manufacturing company click get started. You simply check off the terms and conditions and you can click here to read more about them. And then you upload your bank info or your card info. We make it really easy to connect the bank by using plaid. All they need to do is click the button for the bank that represents the one they work with and enter their phone number and just sync it. So it's very easy to save that information. And once they enter that, you're able to go ahead and schedule payments in advance and auto charge that customer's card or automatically pay that vendor and schedule it in advance.
iPhone: Okay, so if, let's say for the insurance company, this is their payment, is there a place it comes flags?
Participant 2: Yep.
Jacob Greenberg: You're definitely able to filter by overdue payments. Can you hear me there, Kurt?
iPhone: Yep, I'm still here. Hear me?
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, I thought you cut out for a second. So you can just do do on and filter this and it will show you the overdue ones by clicking this button first, but it'll show you in chronological order as well.
iPhone: Does it send them out automatic notifications if their card.
Participant 2: Yep.
Jacob Greenberg: These are great questions. So when you go into the settings tab, you click notifications here and you could customize the notifications that are sent to you or to your customers or to your vendors. So for customer notification, it can give them an automatic notification. If the payment has been paid, you could toggle it on or off. You can let them know if it's failed or if there's been a refund. And you can toggle all of these on and off for your team internally. You can be notified for made payments, failed payments, ach payments, processed refunds and payout paid. You can also put a contact email thing here to set a specific email address to CC every time a payment link is sent out. So if you have a manager from for all of your arn AP and you have other people actually operating and sending out those invoices, you can make sure that a manager or any company email is automatically looped in and cc'd on every email transaction.
iPhone: If we have a customer, does that.
Jacob Greenberg: Satisfy what you were looking for?
iPhone: Yeah, it does. If we have a customer that.
Jacob Greenberg: Kurt, I love this. You're doing my job for me. Yeah, there is. So firstly, this on the settings tab is the universal. So this is like the default, right? Most people put 100 on the customer and that's the default. You could always change that. But. So say I'm working with you. I have an active invoice. Let's see, where did I put the test? So I created this invoice. You see that? You know, you have to pay credit card processing rates, but you want to pay in credit card. You just don't want to pay that much. You call me, say, hey, let me update that. So I could come in here, see all of the settings. I could customize the fees on this payment request and I could edit it so that it says, you know, 50% and we split it 50. 50. Or I could put 0% onto the customer. It's up to Kurt. Are you still with me?
iPhone: Yep, still here.
Participant 2: Okay, cool.
Jacob Greenberg: Does this answer your question for that one?
Participant 2: Yep, it does. Awesome.
iPhone: I just have a couple of those customers that would be that way.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, it's. It's typical that most of the people that use nickel have at least two or three different businesses that will have like custom arrangements. Right. So like our larger distributors and manufacturing users might have customer arrangements with like their best clients where they'll offer them credit card but at a reduced rate.
Participant 2: Yeah, yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: So this is nickel in a nutshell. There's definitely more details in Easter eggs and I'm happy to. If you decide to move forward with this, we could set onboarding times. I'll set you up with a customer success rep so we could onboard and give trainings for everybody on your team. But it is super straightforward. On the help center down here, we have, you know, frequently asked questions and new to, like a walkthrough guide for onboarding. We also have pretty much everything you could do with nickel in a two minute demo video. So it's really easy to learn and get going. I know that, you know, for you guys, it seems like run some numbers here real quick.
Participant 2: It.
Jacob Greenberg: I mean, I think on a conservative estimate of where to be able to save just 2% across all your business units, it'd be $116,000 annually. I think we could probably save a little bit more than that. But mostly it's an operational improvement. Right. It's cleaner and easier for you guys to manage and it saves time for your customers as well. Yeah, yeah, I'm happy you brought that up. So when it comes to chargebacks, like, we can't guarantee that we're going to win chargebacks on your behalf. Nothing can be guaranteed on that front. But what we do is we definitely reduce the amount of times our customers get charged chargebacks to begin with. And because we're the middleman between it, there is some liability on nickel to want to fight these chargebacks for you and on your behalf. So if a chargeback does go through, occasionally, we're on the hook as well. And there are fees associated with it and time invested associated with it for us. So we really are incentivized to win these chargebacks. And the good thing is that we're verifying banking information for both your side and your customer side and documenting absolutely everything in between those transactions. So that if you do need to fight a chargeback for any given reason, we have all the documentation for you to be able to do that successfully. So again, we can't guarantee winning chargebacks, but we help prevent them. And when they do come up, we help win them. It's just, it's always good to have a processing middleman between you and a credit card payment. Sorry, were you signing up for the business? You kind of cut out a little bit.
iPhone: I said, do I. I said, do I get the referral? The referral bonus after my first business.
Jacob Greenberg: We could play this game. I think I can make that work for you. It is. Let me talk internal highlighted. So yeah, yeah, it is. We might be able to do that. If you did it that way, you probably wouldn't be able to set it up as a master account where you have like the clients list, because then you'd be considered one business with one parent account. But if you wanted to set them up all individually, I could probably get you the referral bonus.
iPhone: I would actually rather the master feature personally. It's going to make my life.
Jacob Greenberg: Let me see what I can do.
Participant 2: Yeah, yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: I don't want to guarantee it, but.
Participant 2: What I can do.
iPhone: No, no. With that said, let's say I sell one of those businesses. How easy is it to part that out of that master group?
Jacob Greenberg: Very easy.
Participant 2: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: Just send me a request and I'll ask the development team to do it and they'll take care of it in the same day.
Participant 2: Gotcha. Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: So I guess before we wrap up, because we are a little bit over and I do have another meeting I have to hop to in a couple minutes here. I'm sure you do too. What is your temperature check like, scale of 1 to 10? Do you think nickel would be an effective tool for your business?
iPhone: Yeah, I like it. Honestly, I think there's a little bit of time to roll out. You know, obviously five businesses to roll out, it's gonna just take a little bit of time, but I think it's worth doing. And I think we'll probably have to dive into each business individually and just kind of double check things as we go along.
Participant 2: But.
Jacob Greenberg: When we're thinking about rolling it out, what do you think would be the most realistic and logical place to start as far as which business do you sus out as being like most efficient for the first one to roll out?
iPhone: So I would love to do story because that's all. Credit card seems to be okay, but with that said, I am concerned because I can't actually see the credit card number. So once we plug that in.
Participant 2: I'm.
iPhone: A little Concerned about how that's going to work.
Jacob Greenberg: So say that one more time. You can't see your current fees with Square, so you're worried about rolling it over or you can't see historic transactions either.
iPhone: I can't see their credit card information. So how do we get the customer's credit card information moved over from Square to Nickel?
Jacob Greenberg: Got it.
Participant 2: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: I can look into this for you as well. Are you have recurring charges for those ones right at the storage company?
Participant 2: Yeah.
iPhone: So There's I think 92 customers currently.
Participant 2: Okay. Okay, cool.
Jacob Greenberg: So what I'll do is I'll bring after this call, I'll do my homework and I'll figure out how to export that from Square. I'm sure it's possible. I used just for some background, before I was working with Nickel, I worked with Toast, which is a point of sale service. And the company I dealt with the most was Square on a daily basis. So I know that. I know a couple tips and tricks to export some stuff. Let me look into it for you. But beyond, beyond the storage company, is there another one that you want to roll out as well? Like if we need some more time to do the square stuff, worst case scenario, what else would be like number two on the list?
iPhone: Probably the auction company.
Participant 2: Okay.
iPhone: A payment portal. And they could put in their invoice and then ACH or credit card, that would be, I think that would be very convenient for our customers.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, I gotcha.
Participant 2: All right.
Jacob Greenberg: So I think what we should do before I hop off is we should set a follow up call. Firstly, Kurt, you can go into getnickel.com and create a free account and play around and get activated on your own without me whenever you want to. It's very easy to do. But what I would advise doing is we set a follow up call sometime for like maybe later next week or whenever you have availability and we can. In the meantime, I'll do some research into how we can transfer over easily all the credit card information for the recurring charges for from Square for your storage company. And on the next call we could walk through and outline what it might take to get the auction company transferred over. Will take care of those steps for those businesses on that call. And if we have some additional time, we can make a kind of wider plan for onboarding the rest of the businesses more gradually after you get some testing. Testing in. Does that sound fair?
Participant 2: That works for me.
Jacob Greenberg: Sounds good. What time, what day next week would you prefer to meet? I am available most days except for Thursday.
Participant 2: Okay. Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: And I'M looking at my calendar here. I'm on east coast time. What time zone are you? You in over there? Mountain time.
Participant 2: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. So I've got 10:00am Your time on Wednesday, or I've got 1:30 or 2:00pm Your time on Wednesday.
iPhone: You said 10:00am.
Participant 2: Yep. Yep. Okay, great.
iPhone: You'll send me an invite?
Participant 2: Yep.
Jacob Greenberg: I'm gonna shoot you an invite right now. If you could just do me a favor and accept it. It helps prevent me from getting double booked from inbound meetings.
Participant 2: Yep.
Jacob Greenberg: All right. I sent over that invite. Fantastic. All right, Kurt, I really appreciate. Say that one more time.
Participant 2: You.
Jacob Greenberg: Awesome. All right, I just sent it out. Go ahead and accept whenever you can and have a great weekend. Looking forward to getting the ball rolling.
Participant 2: Yep. You all right?
Jacob Greenberg: Take it easy, Kurt.
Participant 2: Bye.
