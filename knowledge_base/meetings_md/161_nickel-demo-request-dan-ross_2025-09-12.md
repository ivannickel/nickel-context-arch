Jacob Greenberg: Hey, Dan, how's it going?
Daniel Ross: Going good. How about yourself?
Jacob Greenberg: Good, good. All right, great. So I have half an hour on the calendar for us. Does that still work for you?
Daniel Ross: Yeah, I mean, it could be as short as like a minute. Do you guys definitely do QuickBooks desktop integrations?
Jacob Greenberg: Right now we don't have a direct API built for a desktop. We have it in the pipeline. We're looking at October for it to be launched. It's a pretty big request. We get a lot. We do QuickBooks Online direct native integration and for people that use Nickel and have QuickBooks Desktop, we just have an import export feature for CSV. Whenever they need to update to make payments, whatever regular cadence that is, they'll do Do a export from QuickBooks, import into Nickel, and vice versa.
Daniel Ross: Okay, yeah, it's probably not gonna work for me. I need it to be like- Gotcha.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, you guys are on desktop right now for QuickBooks? Yeah, Enterprise.
Daniel Ross: And you guys are using QuickBooks Pay, I assume? We were, they shut me down, so I don't really, I can't wait till October. They shut you guys down? Yeah, apparently commercial real estate is akin to selling adult toys
Jacob Greenberg: and
Daniel Ross: drugs. Wow. In their world.
Jacob Greenberg: Wow. Okay.
Daniel Ross: That's what they told me. I was like, I haven't heard that. I was like, I've been using that for five years. They're like, you got flagged, we can't open you again.
Jacob Greenberg: I was like, great. I know that they've been doing a lot of updates to the platform recently. I haven't heard that one yet, but they're pushing a lot of people to join QuickBooks online and in the process. They've been taking some pretty interesting initiatives. They also just jumped up the price that they charge per ACH as well.
Daniel Ross: It's getting very easy. My next call is Sage. Gotcha. Okay. Do you guys integrate with them?
Jacob Greenberg: Right now we have only have one two-way API and that's with QuickBooks Online. What we do have is on a case-by-case basis, we've built what's called AI agentic syncs or do webhook syncs. And the reason for that is APIs between larger data sources, like ERPs or CRMs, typically it's more information being passed than needed, and it creates security vulnerabilities, and they're pretty hard to build out. So we found that webhooks and AI agentic sinks are more secure. We could build them much quicker.
Daniel Ross: Totally. They take like an hour.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, I'm like, it's a case by case basis though. If you do end up going with a different platform like Sage, or if you do use another, do your evaluation and find one that fits you guys well. If you do want to revisit the conversation with us towards the end of next month, that's when we're expected to have QuickBooks Desktop Live. I could give you updates if you'd like along the way. Or if you do end up going with a different ERP, we could discuss more details about building out a custom sync for you guys. It's not a guaranteed thing. It's a case by case evaluation.
Daniel Ross: No, totally get it. I think I have to just plug the hole right now. So, you know, yeah, no worries.
Jacob Greenberg: Just so that I could put some information here in case, I'll put it on your account and then when we do have desktop out, I can reach out to you and see if it makes sense.
Daniel Ross: It's not going to make sense because I already found another company that can do it right now. They're a little bit more expensive and a little bit more annoying, but... And that's staged? No, no, no. It's shit. What's that company called? I forgot, to be honest.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay.
Daniel Ross: It's like not ramp. It's in that van, hold on. Easy BizCharge.
Jacob Greenberg: Easy BizCharge.
Daniel Ross: The only one that seems to have a full-blown integration with QuickBooks Enterprise.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, cool. All right, cool. Enjoy the experience. I hope it goes well for you. I'm sorry that you had to encounter this. I can reach back out once we have a desktop. Feel free.
Daniel Ross: I'm happy if it's easy to do. I mean, your system seems great from what I read online. It was sort of my first choice.
Jacob Greenberg: Where did you end up finding us, by the way?
Daniel Ross: I have no idea. Between agents and just my own searching for things. You go through 30 different websites really fast and found it. I think I was looking for merchant services and stuff like that. It was interesting. Our volume, though, is several hundred thousand. I think it's like 50 to 70 flows through a month.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, gotcha.
Daniel Ross: Okay. So it's not insignificant, but it's massive for you.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah. Well, once we have the, I'm going to tag your account that you're looking for QuickBooks Desktop. Once we have the feature released, I'll reach out and see if it makes sense.
Daniel Ross: Great. Thanks so much. Pleasure meeting you.
Jacob Greenberg: You too. Have a great day, Dan.
Daniel Ross: You too. Bye.
