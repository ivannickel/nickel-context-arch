Christian Sheerer: Hey, Amanda, Sorry about that. I had a. In a hotel at a conference, so I had to. What's it called? Hot Spot. It.
Amanda Pettay: Will I get a copy of the recording?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, you have a read. You have your thing in here, and I can send you a copy of mine for mine if you need.
Amanda Pettay: Okay. So. Hi, how are you?
Christian Sheerer: Doing well. Doing well.
Amanda Pettay: Just to kind of give you a little bit of background, this all started first with bni. I'm sure you know who BNI is. They're trying to figure out how to. Basically, members aren't paying their freaking dues on time for this space, and it's 150 a quarter, and they're trying to set it up to where they can do the auto billing.
Christian Sheerer: Okay.
Amanda Pettay: And they were going to go through a bank and the ACH would be free, which obviously it's still free with you guys. But if somebody decided to pay via debit card, there was going to be a fee that they would be paying as the merchant fee. And I see where I was like, okay, well, let me research this. Let me see what I can find. And that's how I found you guys.
Christian Sheerer: Cool.
Amanda Pettay: So now it's not just bni. It's. There's several of us that are now interested.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, cool. So, yeah, and so this is really just about transferring over the. The fee when you accept via card.
Amanda Pettay: What? And it's. So it's not just that. So the first. I think the biggest thing that what they're looking for is the set it and forget it style.
Christian Sheerer: Okay.
Amanda Pettay: That is their number one thing. They don't want to have to go in every single month and say, Bill XYZ. You know, right now it's at 30 members. They're hoping to be at 50 members by January 1st. So she doesn't want to be going in there every single month and selecting to bill each person. She just wants to be able to do the reoccurring invoices.
Christian Sheerer: Okay.
Amanda Pettay: Where it'll then send a receipt. And obviously, if you guys do bill pay like that, then obviously there would be a receipt. And that's. I mean, that's pretty clear.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah.
Amanda Pettay: But for the set it and forget it, that is essentially where it's the $35 a month, correct?
Christian Sheerer: Mm, yeah. For recurring payments, 35 bucks a month.
Amanda Pettay: Okay. Do you do estimates? So an example of that, let's say that me, I'm a financial and tax strategist, and if somebody says, hey, look, can you take a look through my quarter two transactions and review to see what deductions I'm missing an example of that. My CPA told me I couldn't write off my rescue dog's dog crate. I had to put him in his crate when I was in meetings because he'd literally be doing zoomies behind me while I was in client meetings. And I'm like, dude, you cannot be running around. I'm trying to have a meeting. So in his crates is safe place, and I bet you that's where he is right now. But he. I looked it up, and IRS Publication 463 says, here's what you track, here's what you do, here's how you write it off. Here's how if it's mixed use. So if I were to write an estimate for somebody and say all of this and then they accept it and then pay it, is that an option with you guys?
Christian Sheerer: No.
Amanda Pettay: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: We just primarily do invoicing, AR. We don't write estimates.
Amanda Pettay: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, we're not like. No, in the short. A bit.
Amanda Pettay: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah.
Amanda Pettay: What about deposits and partial payments?
Christian Sheerer: So you could say invoices all the time? Yeah, it's totally fine.
Amanda Pettay: Okay. Is that only part of the paid version or is it part of the free version as well?
Christian Sheerer: No, that is not gated for the free version.
Amanda Pettay: Okay, so it's only the paid version.
Christian Sheerer: No, no, no. Sorry. You can, you know, on both.
Amanda Pettay: Oh, okay. Okay. So how does that work? If you were to do the invoice. So let's say that I were to invoice you for $1,000 and say I.
Christian Sheerer: Can just pay 750 of it.
Amanda Pettay: Okay, you.
Christian Sheerer: 250 later.
Amanda Pettay: Okay. So is there a way that I could put the dates in to say 750 is due by this date and 250 is due by project completion?
Christian Sheerer: You could put it on the. So we can't split the invoices yet like that. Unless you wanted to send them as separate invoices with separate due dates.
Amanda Pettay: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: Due date per invoice. But you could also put that into the invoice. Are you guys using QuickBooks for them to write out the invoices?
Amanda Pettay: I'm personally using QuickBooks. The question that this came from is somebody who is using a separate CRM and wix and then another one, he's using square. So this is coming from three of us that are asking, but it's a matter of how it works. I know with QuickBooks I can do deposits, so to speak, but what I do, I just say that it's the initial setup fee and that this will be discounted on your next invoice. And then I do literally set up fee minus whatever that dollar amount was, so they can view that the deposit was actually deducted from their total amount due.
Christian Sheerer: Okay. So, yeah, I mean, our invoicing isn't as in depth as like running it through a QuickBooks.
Amanda Pettay: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: But that's why we link up with QuickBooks is because we integrate with them. And then you're going to create a QuickBooks invoice. It'll automatically sync into Nickel, and so you could write out in those line items there. You can also attach any PDF, okay. Even if it's not QuickBooks, right into Nickel so that they're reading it and they say, okay, I have the terms of my short payment of the thousand from 750 one day, 250 the next, and then that link is going to live as long as they have a balance on that invoice. Okay, that would be a solution. I think eventually we do the estimates thing. I don't know, we might want to do it because we're, you know, kind of around the built world industry, so that might be interesting. Certain things that we could build on top of, like, you know, into the platform, but that is definitely more functionality, I guess, or customization around invoices, something that we're talking about and the developers are working on all the time. So, I mean, I think that's well taken, but for now it's not. It's not really a work workaround. It's just. Yeah, you would just. It's just the communication. You would just put that on the.
Amanda Pettay: Invoice, put it in like a Word document or something, save it as a PDF. And do you agree to these terms, yes or no? If you agree to these terms, sign it and then attach that to the invoice once that time comes.
Christian Sheerer: Exactly, yeah, exactly.
Amanda Pettay: And Banjo, give me one second. Did you do. Okay? Okay, you're eating good. Okay, I'll leave you alone. My bad. Jesus. Okay, I'm back.
Christian Sheerer: You're good.
Amanda Pettay: If you're vaping, you're fine.
Christian Sheerer: I'm not, I'm not. I just. I don't like to look at myself. Just like, staring, staring.
Amanda Pettay: Okay, so the next one was, do you store users payment information if they want it to be stored, like for reoccurring?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, yeah. So, I mean, one of our larger customers, they do that all the time. I mean, plenty of people do that all the time. Debit authorization. So we can request it. You can request it through nickel, meaning send them a form that they'll Sign that is like, hey, Amanda's going to charge you on a recurring basis. And you know, here's how nickel stores your information. Here's nickel security standards, blah, blah, blah. Because we're going to store it. Or if you already have one, you can put that in as well.
Amanda Pettay: Okay. And that's only part of the paid plan.
Christian Sheerer: Debit authorization. I don't. Yeah, I don't think. I think it's available for both.
Amanda Pettay: Okay. But like for the recurring billing, that's.
Christian Sheerer: You can't do recurring. Yeah, you. Yeah.
Amanda Pettay: So it can store it if it's on the free version, but if it's the reoccurring, then it's 35amonth.
Christian Sheerer: But if you're gonna, if you're gonna run. So are you gonna be running their instances? Their instances meaning their accounts, nickel accounts, or are you gonna set them up in that sort of way?
Amanda Pettay: I'm not the one who's going to be running their accounts. So I don't like what QuickBooks is doing with their billing. I can't stand it is 10 times worse. And then the integration with Square into QuickBooks makes it where it's just like, dude, this is insane. But what I do like about QuickBooks is for. Well, one of the downsides is you have to select either due upon receipt. Net 10 days, 15 or 30. You can't set custom dates. So it's. It's like, all right, I don't want to tell somebody do upon receipt. Because that's too vague.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah.
Amanda Pettay: They can take it, however. Oh, I didn't see it for three months. Or if I set it too far out, then I've just done all this work and I'm not getting paid. So one of the things is, do you guys allow that customization on your invoices to say this is due on this date?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, you can set it up. It's an invoice date and due date are different. Like invoice date, when it's created, you know?
Amanda Pettay: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: And do. It can be pushed out into the future.
Amanda Pettay: Okay. So for me, my invoices, when I'm sending them out to customers, they are not reoccurring.
Christian Sheerer: That's fine.
Amanda Pettay: Mine are built based on what work I've actually done. Did I need to do tax analysis? Did I need to go and read through 400 pages of IRS tax law? Or did I just need to code transactions?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah.
Amanda Pettay: Versus some are reoccurring. Like the website developer. He. If he's got somebody who he built a website for for five grand and they agreed on 500amonth, then that's going to be reoccurring. Or like the bni. That one's going to be reoccurring.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. So up to. Yeah, none of them are. So the reason I asked if you're going to run the accounts is because if you have an accountant's account where there are like multiple clients under it, think of it similarly as somebody who has multiple business units and they just want to toggle between them. They have one nickel login, but they have multiple units, multiple instances in nickel. You could set it up that way and it would just be 35. So if any of them are going to use any of the plus features, you might want to do it that way. But then you would have, you know, some level of access into all of them, unless they wanted to completely shield you from it. Right. You can still set it up from a privacy standpoint sort of how you want it, but you would have as a bundle, I guess, of accounts is.
Amanda Pettay: Okay. Okay. That's something I can bring up with them.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. And if they want to just do it individually too, that's. That's totally fine.
Amanda Pettay: Yeah, I. So the. The thing that the lady would be an eye. She liked that Clover would do this, set it and forget it. But obviously there's still that merchant fee. So how would you guys differentiate yourselves from. From Clover?
Christian Sheerer: I think clover is like 4, 3.5% or 4% or something.
Amanda Pettay: Yeah. Because it was. If they ran $50 a month, it would end up being 52 total. So I don't know what that percentage is at the top of my head, but obviously that's. Yeah, it's not 10%, but it's also not 2%.
Christian Sheerer: Clover is also like a POS system, right? Or am I getting that mixed up with something else? They have, like, physical terminals, point of sale.
Amanda Pettay: I don't think so.
Christian Sheerer: Oh, I might be just getting that mixed up with something else.
Amanda Pettay: I don't. I don't know. I don't use Clover.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah.
Amanda Pettay: I'm not sure with it. So the other one is remote check deposit. What is that?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, so that's. That's something that'll be live by the end of the year. It's basically if I take a picture of a check and I don't.
Amanda Pettay: Okay. The mobile deposit that you do with your bank. Okay. Yeah, we were just trying to figure out what the heck that was, but I'm just gonna say mobile deposit.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. It comes up a lot and it's just like. It's annoying. Because not technically live, but it will be very soon.
Amanda Pettay: Okay. And we've already talked about the receipts being automatically generated. And then the other question is where I see that we can set the merchant fee, whether we want to pay it as a business owner or if we want to pass it on to the customer. If we pass it on to the customer, will that show up on the receipt so they can write off that merchant fee?
Christian Sheerer: Oh, that's actually a good question. I mean, so that it'll show up in this way. I'll show you.
Amanda Pettay: Because I can write off merchant fees, any merchant fees that are passed on to me. As long as I can view it on the receipt, I can write it off.
Christian Sheerer: So they'll pay it here? Yeah. I mean, right there.
Amanda Pettay: Yep.
Christian Sheerer: It'll be. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, the reason I questioned it in my head is because I was like, I know it's up here, but I didn't have a visual memory of being like, oh, yeah, it's listed out here as well.
Amanda Pettay: I am writing that. That is a big one. That obviously would be an eye. This is all business owners. So everybody's going to want to be like, you know, those that are part of the C Corp. Some major corporations, they're not going to have ACH information available to them. They're going to have a company card versus me. I can just give my business ACH information without an issue.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah.
Amanda Pettay: So I'll be able to say that. Yes, it's right on the invoice. And then obviously the receipt is going to say that amount. Correct.
Christian Sheerer: Mm.
Amanda Pettay: So it'll say like the receipt will be to say, you paid via this date. Do you want. I don't know if you want to pull up a receipt to see if you.
Christian Sheerer: I actually am trying to do that right now. See if I have one in our fake environment. If not, I can pull a real one. Yeah. Okay. This is an older. I think the. The actual layout is a little bit.
Amanda Pettay: Different now, but right there, Fees collected.
Christian Sheerer: Yep.
Amanda Pettay: Okay. As long as it says that, that's fine.
Christian Sheerer: Yep. Yeah. And I just have.
Amanda Pettay: Giving the card number.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, I just went to the transactions here.
Amanda Pettay: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: And I just clicked into that went into, Sorry, View original payment and then all at the bottom. I can download the receipt.
Amanda Pettay: So while you're in transactions, can you show me. Is it possible this is coming. Yes, I see it. Download CSV. That's all I wanted.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, of course.
Amanda Pettay: All I cared about.
Christian Sheerer: And I mean, we. We also have, you know, our own master kind of database of everything so if there's any. Some things that we need to pull or you're having trouble with, like, we have a record of all the transactions that go through nickel.
Amanda Pettay: Okay. How long have you guys been in business? Is this a recently developed company?
Christian Sheerer: No, I mean, in this world, in fintech, it seems ancient because there's a, like a new fintech company all the time and Stripe is only like 12 years old, which is crazy to think about.
Amanda Pettay: Oh, wow. Yeah. Okay.
Christian Sheerer: And. Right. It's like, you know, I think. No, no, I'm just saying because, you know, the years. We're about four years old.
Amanda Pettay: Okay. No, when I, I want to let you know that when I search the questions. Initially, you guys popped up with Reddit immediately. Hey, guys, check this company out. This is what I really like about them. I mean, and it wasn't just one or two chats, it was several chats, several different posts and discussions. And so I read through those to make sure that they weren't bots and whatnot. And I saw that they were valid. Then I was, yeah, telling everybody, you know, okay, no, wait a second. This is a valid company. So hold on a sec. So the other questions are, what happens if the invoice isn't paid by the date requested? For example, if the pay date's the fifth, does another email go out? Do they get reminders? How does that work?
Christian Sheerer: You'll have to manually remind for now. Well, you can do it in the platform. You just click a button to remind. Okay, um, I'll show you. There is on as I'm pulling it up to. It's funny, there was this one really sassy, but like, positive in our direction Reddit post. And it was so. We were all joking about. It was so funny because then the guy, somebody responded and they were like, well, this is. This, you're a bot. And he's like, well, would a bot say this? And then he said something rude and it was like, so. But you just come here and send a reminder. And so notifications, another big thing that we need to build out. I mean, the team is supposed to triple by the end of next year. So, like all of these, like, little quick things I think will kind of get raised. You're not the only prospect slash customers.
Amanda Pettay: You know, come in, who's asking about this?
Christian Sheerer: And so we'll have. Anyway, there's, there's going to be good news soon where, you know, we're, we're going to grow a lot of the team. And so you can think about what that means. But okay, the, yeah, the, the reminders. I am sort of in agreement. I think we should have like, you know, real big flash. Like hey, it's overdue. I don't know, there's probably some psychology around not doing that which is like, you know, we, we don't want to really get in the middle of your guys relationship with the customers. Right.
Amanda Pettay: Well so that, that's one of the things I do like about QuickBooks is I currently have it set right now on net 15 days. So it does the initial email on the, when I send does one, what is it, seven days into it and then the day of.
Christian Sheerer: Cool, that's smart.
Amanda Pettay: So it's not too much. So if somebody were to choose five days, let's say the day it sent and then the day of because obviously you don't want to send it out two and a half days into it. So I think they have it built on their platform where if it's 10 days or more, send it at the halfway point.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, cool. Yeah. No, these workflow things I think are very, are, will be very fruitful for us.
Amanda Pettay: So can we add late fees if it's not paid on time? Can we say if this is not paid, add 5% or does it need to go on to the next invoice to say invoice number 251005 was late?
Christian Sheerer: You would have to sort of.
Amanda Pettay: Because everybody's going to have different late fees.
Christian Sheerer: You would have to manually do it.
Amanda Pettay: Okay. That's, that's how everybody is.
Christian Sheerer: You would have to go in and just edit it. I can edit the invoice whenever I can make this 490. Right. So that's cool. But you would have to edit it. You'd have to edit it.
Amanda Pettay: So how can you say, let's say that you bill for three services. How do you put those three services? Does it have to be one invoice total and then break it down in note for customer?
Christian Sheerer: Up to you. So people who have three services, three things, goods per invoice, they might put it into the invoice that they're creating in QuickBooks or wherever and then just upload that into nickel.
Amanda Pettay: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: Or they split it up. Or each of them requires an individual invoice and they split it up.
Amanda Pettay: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: Up to you.
Amanda Pettay: So if you.
Christian Sheerer: I'm just. This one is maybe not the best example because I was, I kind of just created it to show somebody what the link looks like.
Amanda Pettay: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: But usually your people are creating the invoice in QuickBooks. It's automatically syncing over they can edit it there too. And that sync will sync. I mean, that edit will sync over as well and save. And then they upload this stuff and then they send it out here or they can edit it from here.
Amanda Pettay: So if I go into my. I have an accountant profile in QuickBooks, for obvious reasons, because I'm doing transactions like this. So if I go into my QuickBooks, though, I can actually. Why are you not going to QuickBooks? That's not what I clicked. Thank you. How do I link you guys? Do I need to do it as a bank?
Christian Sheerer: No, no. Yeah, you. I mean, you pick the chart of accounts. Yeah, you have to. It's bank account chart of accounts. But you'll do it through nickel and we'll prompt you. You'll go to. You'll go to your nickel account, go to integrations, and it'll be sync. Quickbook link quickbooks account.
Amanda Pettay: Okay. Because my quickbooks is a free account because I have the accountant version.
Christian Sheerer: Nice.
Amanda Pettay: I'm not trying to say that's good or bad. It's. I have a different. I'm also held by a different set of standards with the accountant version where I can't do stupid crap because of the ethics behind that. So does it matter what kind of account you have with QuickBooks?
Christian Sheerer: No. No. Just as long as it's QuickBooks online. Yeah.
Amanda Pettay: Okay, so this was one that came up. It was how many invoices can be sent a month via the free account. I saw that it was. You could send a limited number of invoices, but the max dollar amount per any One invoice is 25,000. Is that correct? Okay, so that's. They'll live with that. So the one. I think what I know that there was. So basically it sounds like the best bet is to tell the BNI Group that for the. Set it and forget it for the reoccurring is to do the paid version.
Christian Sheerer: Yes. Yep.
Amanda Pettay: And I showed the same customer. Excuse me if I already said this, but I went through his merchant fees in 2023.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah.
Amanda Pettay: And I saw his merchant fees were four grand. And I. It was his. His CPA did net sales. She didn't do gross minus merchant fees. So he was missing that four grand difference. But when I showed him that you guys are ultimately 420 a year, what's going to be more cost effective?
Christian Sheerer: Exactly.
Amanda Pettay: And if I can say if you are passing this merchant fee off or splitting it, will the CSV show that I paid 1.9% and they paid 1%, is there a way that the CSV can show that for.
Christian Sheerer: Oh, that you split it.
Amanda Pettay: Yeah. So this way I can write off the 1.9% merchant fee. They can write off as the other business owner, the 1% merchant fee.
Christian Sheerer: Well, it would show up. Oh, so I mean, it would show whatever they're paying on that receipt. It would show up on that for them.
Amanda Pettay: Yes, but I'm saying.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, yeah, yeah. In. Is there, Is there a way for you to extract information about how much you guys pay of the 2.9?
Amanda Pettay: Yes.
Christian Sheerer: Let me take that back. I don't know. Off the top of my head, it's a good question.
Amanda Pettay: So I have to follow up with.
Christian Sheerer: I understand what you. I understand what.
Amanda Pettay: Okay, so you. Okay, yeah, yeah.
Christian Sheerer: But I, I just don't know where we would show that or. Because on the CSV, it doesn't appear like it would be.
Amanda Pettay: Can you pull up what the CSV looks like or like, let's say you change one of those transactions to where you guys paid the merchant fee and then sync and then pull the CSV and see if it shows up.
Christian Sheerer: It doesn't, but I know, I mean, we're, we're tracking this somehow, so I'll find out if we can. If we can't designate that it just shows fees charged.
Amanda Pettay: But that is the merchant fee. Then.
Christian Sheerer: Yes, but it, it doesn't show if I, if I. It doesn't create another column if the fee charged is less than 3%.
Amanda Pettay: Okay, so it doesn't show if it's split.
Christian Sheerer: Exactly.
Amanda Pettay: Okay, so it's just showing. Here's the fees. And there isn't a way in the CSV to tell who paid what.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah.
Amanda Pettay: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: But I mean, there might be a way that we can pull that stuff. So let me, let me just ask the engineers.
Amanda Pettay: Okay. And yeah, the reason I'm saying that is again, small business owners don't know this, but that is a write off.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah.
Amanda Pettay: Cool. So that's where. Whether they're the ones paying it for service or they're the ones covering it for their customers, it's a write off either way. So that's where. Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: Nice. Okay. Okay, I got you. I'll pull that out. Okay.
Amanda Pettay: Those are basically all the questions you guys are sounding a hell of a lot better than.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, I mean, they're also, they're keeping. They keep. They keep kind of like inching forward the amount of fees that they charge and do.
Amanda Pettay: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: But yeah, I mean, did you have someone, maybe PNI or somebody else that you had some transactions you wanted to test out with. And I say test not because they're not going to work. Like you can run, you know, big one tomorrow if you wanted to. But it tests just so because we're coordinating a bunch of different workflows if. And that's different for each of the different businesses you've been working with. So if you had those and you were able to run three to five or something, we could get back together after those and kind of troubleshoot any.
Amanda Pettay: Questions, how it goes. Yeah, that would be something that I wouldn't have an answer for you until Tuesday. But what I can do is see, hey, can two of us volunteer on the BNI side? Can somebody volunteer on the website side? And I'll use my shareholder distribution as like I'm paying back a loan that I made to my business from my personal account. I'll do that as an invoice on my end because then I can split the merchant fees and see how it all goes from there. So we can see how it looks. But I just need to get everybody on the same page. And it's not always the easiest, of course, but on Tuesday they will literally both be sitting right next to me. So I can ask both of them.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. Do you want to get back together at the end of Tuesday?
Amanda Pettay: Actually that'd be a really good idea. Yes. Okay. Let me take a look at my calendar. So at the moment I've only signed up for the free account.
Christian Sheerer: Okay.
Amanda Pettay: Oh, another business owner. So currently she is billing through wix because if she bills through her CRM, it wants to add on fees every single time. How do you guys work with integrations like Wix?
Christian Sheerer: Don't we? I mean Wix. Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Amanda Pettay: The web, like WordPress, Elementor.
Christian Sheerer: I'm, I, I know Wixes, but I mean more like I. We have a payment portal that is not like very hyper focused on invoicing. It's like an open payments portal and you could just anything that is a hyper. You use WIX hyperlink feature, make it hyperlinked box and you can tag this as the payments portal.
Amanda Pettay: So and then you can, can you set like your own required fields, put a name, first name, last name, company name, email address.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. So if I go to nickel, this is our payments portal. I could pay us.
Amanda Pettay: Or.
Christian Sheerer: Oh, that's fun. We'll do Chicago Brasses. This is one of our customers.
Amanda Pettay: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: And so you go in and you just.
Amanda Pettay: Oh, right there. No, that's perfect. That's all I needed to see. So scroll down on their website though.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah.
Amanda Pettay: So they're set up through Wix. It looks like it's either Wix or it's WordPress, one of the two. But yeah, I see it. Pay invoice right there. So it. That's totally. That's what she wanted to see.
Christian Sheerer: Cool.
Amanda Pettay: And the only thing I don't like about pay invoice, so if you click that again, you're not. It's like we can't change anything in there.
Christian Sheerer: You could if you wanted to. Just require some tinkering.
Amanda Pettay: Okay, so you could say this is what's required, as in first name, last name, email address.
Christian Sheerer: I will say it's a little bit hard to do it, but yeah, you could. You would also. They would. These would create contacts and customers for you as well. So you would get it.
Amanda Pettay: Oh, so okay, so then you could say it doesn't matter what the reason is. It could. You could just put renewal. And then as you're paying by that, here's the contact information information. And then the clients, as in Chicago brass will get the information saying Tom Smith just paid a thousand dollars for renewal.
Christian Sheerer: Yep. 100.
Amanda Pettay: Okay. So. Okay, that answered it right there.
Christian Sheerer: Cool.
Amanda Pettay: No, that's perfect. Okay, well, that was actually four companies I talked to about you guys.
Christian Sheerer: Nice. Yeah, I think the psychology there is. Well, yeah, I mean, honestly, once they all get signed up and activated, we'll, we'll, we'll make sure you get your referral bonus too. I don't know if you even knew about that, but, but I'll make sure we, we. We send it over. Okay.
Amanda Pettay: Yeah, let's schedule something though for.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, does the same time Tuesday work? I'm pretty free, so.
Amanda Pettay: Yeah. You want to do 4:30 again?
Christian Sheerer: Yep, let's do it.
Amanda Pettay: Okay, that sounds great.
Christian Sheerer: Okay. And I'll, I'll summarize all this stuff. I know there are a bunch of different disparate threads, so I'll just like put this all together in an email thread and if anything pops up before then, respond there or call.
Amanda Pettay: Okay, whatever. Okay, I'm. What I'm going to basically let the BNI person know is, look, Clover is going to charge 3.9 to 4% versus either you can split the merchant fee, you can pass on the merchant fee, but for $35 a month you can do the set it and forget it, which is $420 a year. And ultimately that is going to be your best bet. So it's all there. The only downside is going to be the reminder part.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, I mean, that's what of a manual situation. I get, I get it.
Amanda Pettay: That that is going to be her. Her one. Oh, God. But if all she has to do is click a button. I mean, she can set three people on the free version or unlimited admin. It would just be three of them anyways if it, if I wasn't the one overseeing it. But basically where they could go in and you know, hey guys, somebody going in, resend all the ones that haven't been paid. And then we can offer like discounts or something for those that set up where it's just automatically reoccurring.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah.
Amanda Pettay: And then that is something where if I were to pay via ACH to BNI and I said yes, automatically bill my account every month for $50. You guys can do that.
Christian Sheerer: Automatically.
Amanda Pettay: Agree it. Or, or does she have to send the invoice each time and I have to click into it each time?
Christian Sheerer: No, no, it can be automatic. Can debit. They just, I mean they just have to give the consent to have their money.
Amanda Pettay: Okay. So as long as the person gives consent, then it's one of those. We're good.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah.
Amanda Pettay: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. If they've already given written consent, they can, they can do it.
Amanda Pettay: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: They can upload. Yeah.
Amanda Pettay: Okay, that all works then. Yeah. I will let you know how it goes when I speak with them. I am accepting the invite right now.
Christian Sheerer: Awesome.
Amanda Pettay: And then we can go from there.
Christian Sheerer: Cool. And I'll reach out. I have a call I have to hop to in about five minutes or 10. But after I get off that I.
Amanda Pettay: Will take your time. You're. I'm not gonna. Like I said, I'm not gonna see these people until Tuesday.
Christian Sheerer: I'm verbalizing it for myself because I'll think about it if I don't do it today. So I'll just do it.
Amanda Pettay: That's why I do reminders on my phone and then I make it remind.
Christian Sheerer: Well, that's nice.
Amanda Pettay: So. And I'm going to text the. The other networking business owner and tell her I just saw it. You guys do link through the website with a pay invoice and then you will get a. As in she would get a copy of this and that's going to take that off her shoulders. She's gonna love that. I mean, straight up.
Christian Sheerer: Perfect, let's do it.
Amanda Pettay: Yeah, I'm going to text her right now. And basically, good news.
Christian Sheerer: I think Tuesdays we'll just work through kind of how you want to get set up. Meaning like which if you're going to have a multiple client situation or just each has their own situation, and then we can piece together their individual kind of quirks with how their workflows around payments work.
Amanda Pettay: Okay. And then what I can do is if it ends up being individual, I know you need to go, but I will get their THEN email address, send it to you so you can reach out to set up a call with them.
Christian Sheerer: Beautiful. Yeah, we'll just make a thread together and. Because they know you and then. Then. Yeah. Awesome.
Amanda Pettay: Yeah. This way it's not anything crazy, so. Yeah, that's perfect.
Christian Sheerer: Cool.
Amanda Pettay: So. All right, well, thank you. I appreciate it. And good luck at the hotel and hotspots.
Christian Sheerer: Appreciate you. Thanks for your time. And I'll see you. I'll see you Tuesday.
Amanda Pettay: All right, sounds great.
Christian Sheerer: Bye.
Amanda Pettay: Bye.
