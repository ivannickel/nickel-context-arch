Emma Pell: The day over here, and Matt was on, and then I think he just had to step away real quick.
Christian Sheerer: Oh, okay. Well, thank you for making the time. So. I guess let's start from, like, even scratch. I know we had a good conversations. Thank you for picking up the phone when we. When I called you, because it gave me a good download, and it's like, I think the primary motivation that you guys found us. for was these fees that you're getting eaten, eating up on ACH and credit card. Yeah. Yeah.
Emma Pell: That's what we're most, we most don't like.
Christian Sheerer: And apart from that, what are. I. Guess, how, like, what are the types of payments that are coming in? and payments going out, like what vendors are we paying? But I think we'll start with the ones that are coming in first, like what's the typical size, like how much is going to the fees and then what methods did you guys collect them?
Emma Pell: Yeah, I know some of this. I don't know. Matt will be back hopefully in a second. But so a lot of our clients, it's usually like sports clubs or universities. And it's usually for like a few thousand up to like our biggest clients might pay us like $20,000 is kind of the biggest we usually get. And that'll be like for the year. So it's like they pay once and then that lasts, it's like a year long subscription. And then usually I think it's through like ACH, whatever that is, credit card or sometimes they do mail us checks that we like deposit. I think those are the main ways.
Christian Sheerer: Okay. And so it's one, is it one payment?
Emma Pell: So usually, I mean, we give them like one invoice, but we'll have because it's like colleges and they have all kinds of processes. Sometimes they'll give us like a deposit and have to wait till we ship or they're like, well, our budget has for this month, we can only spend this much. So they'll break it up.
Christian Sheerer: Okay. So they'll so. Okay, I'm trying to. Wrap my head around that. So the okay, so you'll have one payment, right? Meaning like, okay, one invoice, and then you split that up into multiple different payments over time. Right.
Emma Pell: Like, if they're like, well, we can only pay you a thousand right now, we'll be like, oh, okay, no problem. How about we set set up a plan and have you pay us, you know, in two months when your fiscal year starts or the semester, whatever, for schools, they'll pay us, like, the balance that's on their invoice in QuickBooks.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, I got you. And I, and, and is it usually split up across a certain cadence or that's totally up to the particular. School. For example, that you're dealing with, meaning. We work with clients that have every full invoice is paid out over four payments. But this one seems it's more random.
Emma Pell: I think it's a lot more dependent on the school and it's like they, when they start their subscription and some of them pay a fee the second year and some of them don't based on like what they negotiate with our sales guys. as far as I'm aware, it's kind of random.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, cool. And do you know, okay, so that's the, that's the stuff coming in and people pay, it's about a split with credit and ACH. I know you guess somebody gets a check, but like, that seems few and far between and you probably just tell them, hey, come pay us through the nickel payment link. Don't send us a check so it doesn't get lost.
Emma Pell: We like the online, but sometimes the schools are required to like, do. I don't know. There's, like, paperwork that's specific to certain states and, like, laws for colleges, I guess, but, yeah, I don't know the actual split of.
Christian Sheerer: It's not too important. I just. Just roughly that it's like, you know, you're doing both and. So when we get into the platform, I should show you both.
Emma Pell: Yeah, maybe just showing both because I do not even know how to see that.
Christian Sheerer: So. Okay, cool. And that's sort of the idea behind Nickel is like giving your customers all of the options makes it easier for them. It sounds so simple, but makes it easier for them to pay you. And so that then they pick whatever the one that they want. And we have a way to set it up so that if you are accepting credit card, you can do it in a way that passes the fee on to them because we're handling the payment without tripping over any wires on surcharging laws, et cetera. So fully compliantly and then, you know, any 2.99% that they'll pay on the credit card, you can push on to them. You can, if you guys, if your sales team wants to negotiate with it, you can pay for some of it or all of it or make them pay for all of it. So that's one thing. So you're, Giving them complete all the options and then on the ACH it's always going to be no fee. And. Are you, Emma, going to be the one like, you know, are you the one sending invoices in QuickBooks and stuff like that?
Emma Pell: So usually that's our sales guy, Michael. He like does the deals with the people and emails and then he goes in and just kind of creates it and gives them that link.
Christian Sheerer: Awesome. Okay. And it's that Intuit link, right, where they're like, hey, pay this invoice.
Emma Pell: Yeah, it's just whatever, like automatically through QuickBooks. I think it's how we usually get it.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, cool. So we can do two things. One, as I'll show you. And should. We wait for Matt?
Emma Pell: Yeah, he was just here. Let me see where he's at. I have sent someone to go find him because he was like logged on and everything and then I don't know.
Christian Sheerer: And do you know roughly how much is going in and out? Like we didn't talk about the vendors, which we can talk about when we're in the platform, but do you know how much roughly on a monthly basis coming in and out?
Emma Pell: It's a great question. It definitely, I do know, I don't really know, but I know it varies greatly because like the summertime we have a lot of deals because a lot of clubs and universities are going back for like soccer season in the fall and then winter is like a lot quieter. because it's more like they're already in season, they're done with their season. We're branching into basketball a little bit, but not really that much. Okay, Matt says he got pulled into another call, so he will be back soon if he can.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, yeah, I see that. That's okay. And we're recording this so we can send him over a recording. And I think the way that I typically structure these is, Show the platform. It should be pretty simple, but provided that you guys feel pretty comfortable with how it looks and how if you think you have easy time educating the salespeople on how to make a transaction through here, and it will be pretty simple, then we set up a situation which, okay, cool. Know, we leave this call and you guys are ready to go, Hey, make some test transactions, either if it's a test or, I mean, we handle transactions up to a million dollars. So like the highest one on your end, 20,000. I don't like calling it a test because it's like we can handle $20,000 transaction. We did dozens this morning, right? Um, and so anyway, you get familiar with the system and then we come back in a check in after you run some transactions to see, okay, cool. what did I need to troubleshoot? What do I, what am I missing, you know? And then if there's anybody else, if Michael, you know, wanted to get on a call, he'd been manipulating it just from his logging in, then I can spread that all out and we have, like, a, a plan to get you guys fully making the most of it.
Emma Pell: Yeah, that sounds great. Yeah, I can kind of get. A general idea and then tell everybody else what I found out.
Christian Sheerer: Awesome. So you see, do you see my screen?
Emma Pell: I do, yeah, there it is.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, awesome. And so this is like a summary. I mean, these are all fake transactions, so I don't really have a good summary. But in terms of QuickBooks, I think that's where I'll start because we don't want to shake the boat there. And you guys are online, right? QuickBooks online. Yeah. Okay, cool. And so I'll just go to settings and I link my QuickBooks account and I will automatically have it flow back and forth in real time. That means like a couple minutes delay. So if I am getting paid and I need to create an invoice, if I create an invoice in QuickBooks, it'll pop into here.
Emma Pell: Okay, awesome.
Christian Sheerer: So it'll pop into here and then I can go and send this link which is tied to that QuickBooks invoice. And so you'll just rather than sending it on the QuickBooks Intuit links where you're going to pay that 1% soon to be 1.5% whatever you're kind of made to pay on the credit card side. You'll just educate them to pay through this payment link here.
Emma Pell: Okay. And it just does it. That's great.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, and I can show you what it looks like on the customer's end. So I'll copy this. Let me see if I can send a reminder. I'll send it to my teammate. Let me send it to me. Okay, so this is me. I'll send a reminder. And I'll show you in this tab what that looks like. So I pop in and then boom, right? Oh, nice. This invoice to pay, I'll pay by bank. It's nice to for I think dealing with clients where maybe you're not dealing with the person who has the full bank account access, right? But they have a routing and accounting number. Like if you're dealing with an accounts payable team on some other organization, right, your customer, rather than having to go and grab their boss and say, hey, you need to log into the bank account or you need to write a check, you need to blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, right? go through these levels of multi-factor authentication. Typically, the account payable team will have a routing number and bank account number and put that in very quickly. And so can spin it around pretty much on the same day that you send out the payment to them, or you can make it tied to like a due date in the future.
Emma Pell: Yeah, okay. That's really cool. Awesome.
Christian Sheerer: Mm-.
Emma Pell: Yeah, we work with, I mean, like universities or even like these big clubs and it's like these athletic guys who don't know a lot about like all the inner working stuff. So I think that the simpler we can make it so they don't have to go to their, you know, the higher up people is always good.
Christian Sheerer: Mm-.
Emma Pell: So then otherwise it'll get delayed and they're like, oh, well so and so is out of office, but the coaches are there, but the coaches don't always know a lot. So if they can just know their bank stuff, that's great. Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: And does that, has that happened in the past where you've had sort of a delay because of just silly administrative stuff? Yeah. Yeah.
Emma Pell: It's not, not like uncommon, especially over the summer and people are out of office or on vacation or whatever, and like the coach is ready to go and it's like, I want these before players get back or whatever, but then we're stuck waiting for so and so to get back and give us one last piece of information or something like that.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. And it's like, what are we doing? You know, it's like we're in, we're 2025. Right. And that's sort of how I think about it. Like, you know, we're, we're built for all types of companies, but it was nice to be able to build out for, like, this construction industry. I get. That's like a very limiting way to describe what nickel does, but that was, like, the first kind of big problem we were tackling is, like, you're on a job site and you don't have your boss ready to go and open his bank account and do a multi-factor or write a check and you lose that check in the mail for a couple hundred thousand dollars. So if we're simplifying that process, it's gonna be even simpler for y'all. Exactly. So yeah, coach, somebody who has account routing number, or they can just throw in their card payment. And I've set up my settings to pass that fee onto them completely. So card will be a day, one business day turnaround, ACH about two.
Emma Pell: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah.
Emma Pell: I think what we've been kind of trying to do to try to get rid of these fees is we've had our guy, Michael, adding on, like, a processing fee as a, like, a line item in our invoice that he goes in and manually has started, like, trying to add in so they can. So we don't pay the whole, like, fee. But with you guys, it's just automatic, so we don't have to calculate and be like, okay. this much, you pay this so we don't have to kind of thing.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, exactly. And that, that's like, there's two issues we found with that, which is why we built that part of the product. One is time, like you just said, right? I have to calculate it. And then it might be also another conversation. Some customers are like, you know, I've been in sales for a while where, anything that's another line item is like another two days of a conversation just because people are busy, right? And it just goes into an email back and forth of like, what's this line item? I thought I was paying for this.
Emma Pell: And yeah, we definitely get that for sure.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. And so that's one thing. It's like you just make that super simple. And then second one is if you want to have that conversation, you do have the flexibility But adding on a charge to cover credit card fees in some states is against, is like surcharging and saying against their surcharging laws. But because we're handling the transaction and putting it elsewhere, we're kind of making sure that every transaction is compliant by those surcharging laws. We have a bunch of blogs on our site about each state. What is, are the clubs and universities all over the country? They're primarily on the West Coast.
Emma Pell: No, it's it's all over for sure and then we even have international clients in a lot in Canada and then a few in We just got one in the Cayman Islands for gosh sakes in Singapore. So some of those but mostly us and Canada.
Christian Sheerer: Cool. Cool.
Emma Pell: It works through international and everything. I mean, it's just the internet.
Christian Sheerer: So. Yes, and so we can deal with your bank as a US bank. Canada, I know, yes, I'm going to need to just for the time being, there's a possibility, but I need to wrap my head around it when I get into the office today with my engineering team. So I'll leave that as a follow-up of like, okay, we're billing from somebody in the Cayman Islands. how that all shakes out. Yeah.
Emma Pell: I mean, I think the. The guy that we've been in touch with, he's, like, American, and that's why I think he has, like, an American credit card, but he just lives there now and is starting a club or something.
Christian Sheerer: Okay.
Emma Pell: So I don't.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, sometimes. Yeah. No, no, no, no. And, yeah, and I don't think I would say worse. I just. I like to be extra careful when I'm on these calls and answering questions. Like, let me just make 100% positive. Yeah, it might be the case that he just banks in the US still and just lives there. Right. And. Also it's small. So like, as we're going through this rollout and you get everybody in the US on Nickel and this Cayman Islands one needs to be like a special example because you're a special guy. You want to go into the Cayman Islands. Anyway, yeah, I will take that back to just like fully get a good download on what the possibilities are there. And it's, you know, you'd be surprised it's online, but there are a whole host of things to think through when you're doing international money movement. It's like all these money laundering.
Emma Pell: It's a vast majority US and Canada for sure, and then just a few one offs.
Christian Sheerer: Cool. I mean, our goal is to grow into international payments as well too. And we're doing that very quickly. And so ultimately we will make sure all of them are running through Nickel, but I just want to be clear on that before I do that. And so I'm going to show you, sorry, get paid. Yeah, this is where you set up that split. And so this is the global rule, global meaning for every customer, this is the default rule. of, okay, that's 3% on the credit card, the buyer is going to pay ACH is free. And then you can also allow them to edit the payment amount so that, okay, for that invoice, they're going to make a payment and they'll still have that balance and you'll still be able to track that balance of this was a $20,000 arrangement, but you're going to pay it over 5,000 in one time, 6,000 the next, 9,000.
Emma Pell: Yeah, that's super common. We have that all the time. So that's really cool that they can just do that on their own without us having to be like, Great, let's adjust this for you. And I think our sales guy, it sounds like from what I hear, he spends a lot of time doing that manual stuff, which is just 2025, we shouldn't be doing that.
Christian Sheerer: And so he just sits it. So walk me through that if you know he will create, let's just call it 20,000. He'll create an invoice, send it to them, you guys have a deal ready to go, and then they're like, oh, well we can't pay 20,000 right now, we have to do it in this, and then he has to go back and send another invoice or?
Emma Pell: Well, I don't know a lot of the details, but I know sometimes because for like their records, it's like something about the records and it's like split it into we can we can only pay $2,000 for this season like this fiscal year. So bill us for this and then in the fall, we can pay you the rest, you know, 5,000 whatever that we owe for it's like 7,000 but we're like for their records, we can split it up. And so we're like we give them flexibility because there's often like budget stuff.
Christian Sheerer: Cool. Okay.
Emma Pell: That's all I know.
Christian Sheerer: No, but that makes sense. I think this will just overcome that issue pretty cleanly, and then you'll still be able to see the balance remaining on a particular invoice.
Emma Pell: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: And you can even set it up. I think one of the easiest ways you might be doing it is I'm going to set up a new invoice. For for. Fiscal year 26 and you make the total amount whatever 20 000 and then I guess the final due date when they're ready to go like oh we can only pay you the full 20 in this next year on 10:31. Do you ever keep, but it sounds like you only do once a year with the people?
Emma Pell: Usually, yeah, it's like a subscription, but we often have them be like, oh, we need three more. And so we send them like a little invoice in between if they need it. But like their big annual subscription fees are like once a year.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, so most of them are two questions. So then most of them are recurring. Does that sound right?
Emma Pell: Yes, well, I mean, and like they have to choose to renew, so we always have some people who choose not to and then they're done. And then it also depends sometimes like we'll adjust the dates. So it's not like every year on the same date necessarily.
Christian Sheerer: Okay. Okay. So, yeah, I mean, you can set it up to be recurring just so you can kind of, like, set it and forget it. And ultimately, people don't have, like, it's not like we're not debt collectors. Ultimately, like, we want it. We are going to give you the full visibility to make the conversation with them happening with the most amount of information. and the easiest way for you. So if you set it on this recurring, hey, this is a yearly subscription next year, we're going to have a bill for the same amount. I'll schedule it for every year. Next year, we're going to have a bill for the same amount. If they don't pay it, then you'll have to go in and edit that invoice to say, okay, now the next invoice in the schedule is now August 24th, 2026, rather than August 19th. And so the reason I say, oh, we're not debt collectors or whatever, is just because we're not gonna like pull it from their account unless they're sending it. Right.
Emma Pell: They still go in and pay it. Okay. I do think that could help because the way we do it, I mean, we use Google Sheets and we just know every August send an invoice to so-and-so, which is just not the most efficient way to make sure we get people and get 'em paying on schedule and stuff. So I actually think this could be great. And then is it a way to see who's upcoming and like, okay, invoice is due in August. So we can go back and email them first and be like, Hey, confirming we're still good. Let me, can I send you over the invoice? And then that's when they say yes or no.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, you can sort it by who's due when.
Emma Pell: That is, that would be, I think, a big help for us to just set it and renew because right now it's really manual and it's hard to scale up to as we hire more people. It's like, to keep going back and asking our one guy, hey, when did, what was the date of their transaction? And then do the math from there. And that's annoying sometimes.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. And I can always see all the scheduled ones and the archives. So this is just like fully done or overdue, and I just kicked them off as a customer or something like that, or all of the completed and paid ones when it was sent, Etc. And then once you set them up as recurring, you can always send them those one-off payments or, like, you can always send them a one-off invoice. Like you said, oh, I need three more. You know, let's just get that added to the bonus. Or you could do something like this, which we do, we can help do for you. This is one of our customers, and we like talking about them a lot because they're good. friends of ours, but they have a, and multiple customers have a, this is part of the plan, payments portal. So this could be useful for those one-off ones that maybe aren't tied to those particular, maybe this is like clearing up on a balance or isn't tied to a particular subscription. You can have them just come to the site and say, oh, do I need to pay an invoice? All right, cool. I'll put that in here. I'll go make a payment.
Emma Pell: But they just have to know the amount that they owe already.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, this is, I think this is just, this probably I wouldn't worry about on your guys' end too much. I think I would just do it, you know, because you guys are, your payments are a little bit few and far between. this is for, you know, those ones that, like, I need to pay Chicago brass, you know, a week after I already paid them because I need this. And, you know, I didn't have the money at the time, whatever.
Emma Pell: Right. Yeah, probably less. So we do have a Shopify, and so, I mean, our goal is eventually, if they need a one-off they just order it through there and it just goes. But we're not there yet with the whole.
Christian Sheerer: Everything.
Emma Pell: But this sounds really cool for those big like team orders where they're buying in bulk for their organization, which is mostly how we use QuickBooks now and then Shopify is for like one random person in New Jersey bought it or something.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah.
Emma Pell: Okay. This sounds really cool. I really like especially I think the CEO Matt is going to like the fee part and that set the recurring invoice and I don't even know maybe we can recur in QuickBooks, but we haven't yet.
Christian Sheerer: So.
Emma Pell: This sounds like this would just be such an easy way to do it. So I think it sounds good, but I don't really make the choices. So I will definitely pass all this along to Matt and Michael, who's the one who would be mostly using it to see what they think.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. And before we have to hop, just because I got to go in a couple minutes, let's do two things. Do you have. Do you know if there's. some transactions to be processed in the next couple days?
Emma Pell: That is such a great question. I don't even know how to find that. I mostly just fulfill them once they're already paid. So I'm actually not sure. I'm sorry.
Christian Sheerer: Oh, no, all good. I was just asking to see when might be good to Because you guys can get set up like today. I can send over this full video that we just had for Matt to take a look at and Michael. And I also have a shorter video that walks through the entire platform. It's about seven minutes for y'all to get set up, run a couple of transactions, and then we get back together. I was just wondering if doing that next week would make sense or later this week would make sense.
Emma Pell: I I'm trying to think we have a lot that have just recently paid because they're going back and, like, sports teams are starting up already, so I'm not sure. I mean, it kind of varies each week. I guess it's almost the end of the month, so maybe people are paying at the end of the month. I really don't know, to be honest, but I can ask.
Christian Sheerer: You know, and whether it's like, you know, a couple customers, when they get started, they, like, run a couple of, like, you know, dummy like, hey, here's a dollar transaction just to make sure they're understanding the flow and setting up or recurring correctly. And then after that, we can plan for a check-in if Matt wants to be on and if Michael wants to be on where I can just, like, give a full. Right. Okay, you guys already got your feet wet on it a little bit. Here's how it works. Writ large. And you can always get started for free. We have, like, a two-week free. use of it for everybody. And then after that is 35 a month. So does it make sense to just put some time on the calendar? Maybe in between then my homework will be the international stuff. Homework for y'all would be get your feet wet in the platform and then we can come back and like kind of answer any questions that would prevent like a full, okay, this is how we Make sure to boost the words Circleback, Christian, Sheerer, Eva by Marblism, Christian.
Emma Pell: Sheerer, Matt yeah, I Pell, think that sounds Emma Pell great. in We the can audio. put something on the books and I'll just invite the guys and they'll figure it out.
Christian Sheerer: Cool. Yeah. What do you think about. Do you think Friday's too quick?
Emma Pell: Friday's probably fine. Yeah, that's probably good.
Christian Sheerer: Does the same time work? I know it's early for y'all.
Emma Pell: Probably. Probably, probably yes. Yeah, let's just, I'll just tell them they had to be here. So yeah, that's good.
Christian Sheerer: Nice.
Emma Pell: And then I can make it too if it's early.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, cool. Yeah, I'll send you, I'll put Matt on the invite as well. And yeah, and if you want to bring Michael on, because he'll be using the platform. Feel free to, but this is all recorded too. So I think that might be useful. And so we'll check in on Friday. If you can try to run a couple of transactions just to get your feet wet on the platform, I'll send a link to get signed up. It's just getnickel.com, very easy to sign up and get started. And then we'll go from there.
Emma Pell: Great, awesome. Thank you so much. I'm excited to go back and let the guys know how all the stuff I learned today and get them ready for Friday.
Christian Sheerer: Yep, got you. Okay. Well, it was nice to meet you. Thank you for hopping on so early. Yeah, me too.
Emma Pell: Yeah, thank you so much.
Christian Sheerer: School today? Yeah. Okay. Well, have fun and good luck.
Emma Pell: Thank you.
Christian Sheerer: New year is just started or what?
Emma Pell: Yeah, first day back. Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, cool. Awesome. All righty. Well, have fun and I'll see you Friday.
Emma Pell: Thank you. See you then. Bye.
