Zak George: Hey, I'm doing great. Good to finally see you in the flesh. Just waiting for my colleague to hop on. I believe he's just about to hop off of one meeting.
Christian Sheerer: So, yeah.
Zak George: How's it going so far?
Kush Shah: It's going well. Just busy, but busy be good. Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: Right, cool.
Zak George: Oh, there he is. Speaking of him, Christian, you there?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, what's up?
Zak George: Hey, what's up? Christian, I'll be right here, flying the wall. You can just ask me any questions if you feel like asking me something. Christian's account executive over here. he'll be taken over and. Yeah, I'll be around.
Kush Shah: Okay. Yeah. Thank you, Kush. What's up? Hey, how's it going? Happy Friday.
Christian Sheerer: Happy Friday. Yeah, I have a. I think I have a pretty decent download. Probably better to hear it from the horse's mouth, though. Not to call you a horse. That's off put. But I guess give me, give me kind of like the full download on what you're looking, this is for both Altiro and ComicFi or?
Kush Shah: I mean, I was gonna, I do a lot of things and he, you know, Zak brought this up where sending like a payment stripe link to certain customers, we're doing like a venture where we're just reaching out to businesses that don't have websites and build websites for them. basically. Nice. My initial thought was use Stripe. He brought up about fees and I figured, why don't I just give it a shot and see what we have to say, learn about a little bit, and that's why we're here. Cool.
Christian Sheerer: And what are the payments typically like?
Kush Shah: That's TBD. We're about to close in on one, maybe next week. But, my initial thought was just have them do a initial upfront and then do a subscription afterwards. So for this one currently, I was gonna charge, like 450 for the first three months and then 150 after in perpetuity.
Christian Sheerer: Cool. So this is the first one that you're running through, first, first deal to close.
Kush Shah: Yeah, cool. Fingers crossed, yeah.
Christian Sheerer: Well, yeah, yeah, my bad.
Kush Shah: It's over, it's over.
Christian Sheerer: You got the sales gods karma, all right? They screwed you. Nah, they'll be fine, they'll be fine. And so, yeah, I think a couple of things. One is, so you want it to.
Kush Shah: Be.
Christian Sheerer: Just a direct link for each one and then having a recurring at the end for 450 for the first and then 150 after.
Kush Shah: Essentially, yeah. I mean, it's subject to change, the pricing and all that, but that's for this first one, I'm starting small and I'm going to do, that was like the plan here. Cool.
Christian Sheerer: I think here is the bulk of it. This should be very simple. And you could get set up today. We could try a transaction like within this call if you want. And sorry, I'm trying to find screen share and I made my Zoom window super small. I think the key difference on Stripe is we can handle way bigger payments. Stripe, as you know, kind of best in class for the small software movements, but they're going to charge you 1% on ACH. We won't. If they charge you on the card, they're probably going to be charging more than 2.9% and probably don't have that good of an ability to pass on fees. We can pass them on to the customer if you want, if they want to pay by card. So immediately knock off the 1% there. You just have full optionality to them. Like, frankly, the reason that we're able to do that is because we deal primarily with businesses who have huge transactions, right? Where we would come to them and say, Hey, what is your transaction size? And they're like 200,000 on the small end, right? And so we're not averse to having people who have smaller transactions on. If anything, they reap the benefits of us focusing on the bigger transaction sizes and being able to use a platform for that free ACH, take advantage of it, and then as they grow, continue to use it.
Kush Shah: Right?
Christian Sheerer: And so you would send out a bill. So sorry, this is to pay a vendor. Do you pay any vendors? You just do that straight. I'm sure you're just like individually putting your card on vendor stuff.
Kush Shah: Yeah. Yep, cool.
Christian Sheerer: And so when you send an invoice to somebody, you can create a customer. I'll just make, I think I have Chris five already, yes, so I'll do Chris six. Throw in their email, I'll use my email. Oh, sorry, that's the purpose. So that's, what would we call it? Deposit, down payment, whatever. whatever you want. And then throw in the 450 one time. And then you can create another one that's like the recurring 150. And then I'll show you what a recurring one looks like. You can send them reminders, follow up with them, et cetera. Have a two-day forum if you want to put it into the future, whatever.
Kush Shah: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: Are you using some ERP yet?
Kush Shah: No, no, not currently.
Christian Sheerer: Cool. Are you looking into one?
Kush Shah: I don't think I really need one at the moment.
Christian Sheerer: Probably not.
Kush Shah: Maybe you see our, we use Pipe Drive, but ERP system, we don't really have one. We make them, but we don't use them.
Christian Sheerer: Nice. Yeah, I mean, honestly, you're probably as you can imagine, we talked to a lot of people. I talked to some guy just now who was like, what's Zoom? And I was like, nice. Okay, cool. So we talked to a lot of people who are less Adept than you. So you'll, you'll be able to figure out, and you'll have all the invoices and batches right here, right. Completed in the future, what have you. And so I send the, like, link to myself, and then I'll go in, and this is what it'll look like on the payer side. It's So for they'll get this the link. deposit and then you could just make the option or they will already have this option to pay by their bank card, what have you. This is nice. I think as you think about it in the future, if you are going after a larger client who's like, you know, they're sending like an ops person at you to handle like the payment stuff, they might not have like full access into the bank account. This is a good thing. Everybody should have like the routing account number so like the owner doesn't have to get involved in all this stuff, right? that might be something to think about. That's a good value add for us because, you know, somebody's making a large transaction, they don't have to like flag down the owner to get all the bank account information, multi-factor, et cetera. They can just put in the routing and the account number.
Kush Shah: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: Or they can pay by card.
Kush Shah: I see. Is, so the fees just go onto them. Right? Not as opposed to Stripe having charging me for that.
Christian Sheerer: Well, the 1% ACH, we are, we, it's, we're not passing it. The only fee that's involved, we're just, it's not existent for us. The only fee that's involved is on the credit card. And yeah, the default logic is to pass it. You can share it if you want. You can eat it if you want. Up to you.
Kush Shah: Okay. Okay. So for, I guess for this scenario, we would do, like, a one-time payment and then send them a subscription three months after the fact. Is there, is there, like, no, like, one shot where, you know, you can flub it as, like, a free trial and then. they get charged three months after in perpetuity or how does that work?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, you can set up a recording.
Kush Shah: Yep. Okay.
Christian Sheerer: So I think hopefully I have this guy. 150 and then. and then we'll just start it. What's three months from now? November. And then this is in perpetuity?
Zak George: Yeah, November.
Christian Sheerer: November.
Zak George: Sounds about right. So if today is a 15, that's gonna be a 15 as well.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, that was a, that was a weekend. Okay. do it that way.
Kush Shah: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: You can also, if you want to send them a debit authorization, because we're pulling the funds, they need to sign it through us. And so you can send it. And then once we get their consent, we can just charge their payment method on file automatically so they don't have to think about it or you don't have to think about it.
Kush Shah: I see. Okay. Do you have like a one pager or something that you send to people that, because I mean, I just need the information and I don't think I have the mental capacity right now to just make a decision, but I just want to make sure I have all the information. Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: What information are you thinking you'd look for?
Kush Shah: Just comparison, like what you guys do. better than Stripe, basically. Like, what's your value prop? Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: You won't have to pay any fees, ACH, and you can pass all their credit card. You can also have a payments portal. That's a nice thing. I mean, I think that's the short of it.
Kush Shah: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: The long of it, I don't know what Stripe charges, like on just their SaaS. we'll be 35 a month. That's like, frankly, a little bit lower than we should be charging. So there's a pretty good value there.
Kush Shah: And.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, I mean, it's, it's, it's sort of, it's sort of as simple as that.
Kush Shah: Okay. And your website is getnickel.com. Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: Could get set up today, test out a transaction. I'm happy to send you a one pager. What is the tipping scale on a decision? It's sort of a low lift decision, frankly. It's not like I've sold software for a while. I've been at places where you sell software that takes a month to get implemented.
Kush Shah: Right?
Christian Sheerer: So it's like, oh, I actually have to mull over this. I'm curious what that is for you here.
Kush Shah: Like what will get me to sign up? Is that the question?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, yeah, you mentioned, yeah, exactly.
Kush Shah: Yeah. I mean, I'll sign up today. I don't mind. Let me do it right now, actually.
Zak George: What are we showing the pricing page for us for comparison?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, it's 35. 35 a month if you're paying on a yearly subscription. 45 for if you're paying month to month.
Kush Shah: Okay. I see. I see.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, that's on the site. I can share screen, but- yeah, can.
Zak George: We share that so we can have a look at it?
Kush Shah: I'm looking at it right now.
Zak George: Oh, you are?
Kush Shah: Cool. Yeah. Okay. Let's. See here. Yeah, I'm just like. I'm not, like, really pressed to make a decision just yet. Just because I need time to make sure like I've got all the information and I do enough comparison and all that kind of stuff, but I'll keep you I'll keep you posted, man. Like, yeah, I appreciate this. Yeah, no worries.
Christian Sheerer: Do you want to just make time to check in a couple weeks time or when do you think? And again, you're going to be adept more adept than and have a way lower barrier to entry than 95% of our customers who do like, they have to think through, it's like, oh, I'm gonna move $50,000 a week through this platform, right? So we don't have to speak again if you don't, you know, if you're like, okay, yeah, this makes sense. I'm just gonna, you know, save 1% on ACH and set it up and I can send a link to everybody. You're more technologically adept and also it's like, you're, you know, really not much to think about. So if you don't want to hop on another call, totally okay. But if we want to check in, if you run some test transactions and then you want to troubleshoot anything with me, we can set up some time to do that.
Kush Shah: Yeah, it's none of those stuff. It's like the math, right? Like I need to make sure, but I mean, to put it simply, like depending on how this next month goes or next month and a half goes, I want to see how those transactions go and then I'll compare the math. I mean, you know, you guys versus this. And like, I'm just, I'm trying to make an informed decision. That's the only thing. Like nothing else.
Christian Sheerer: No, no, no, 100%. And you can, you can start, we have free baked in 14 day trial. So like, that'll give you time to make that math and just play around it and, yeah, yeah, exactly. And, and, and if you want to just put time on the books in the case that we need to come back, totally cool. And we can move it in the future. If you get on there and it's like math worked out cool. Nicole, I'm just gonna get it set up again. Probably not that much of a lift for you to get set up. Again, I've sold software. It takes a month to implement. This should take like an hour.
Kush Shah: Okay. Yeah. If you throw something for, let's see, we're on August 15th. If you find me for October, early October, I'm sure I'll have enough of a opinion by that point. I should. Cool, yeah.
Christian Sheerer: And if you get set up and run some transactions, we'll be able, small team that sees everything, so we support you'll have access to, we'll be able to track anything if it's, again, very low likelihood it goes wrong, but if you run into anything that you need help troubleshooting, we'll be here and you'll have my contacts. So I'll just follow up after this call.
Zak George: We have a very solid customer support team, so you're not gonna have any problems. I guarantee it.
Kush Shah: Yep.
Christian Sheerer: So I'll send you one for the 10th of October.
Kush Shah: Okay, awesome. How long have you been building this slash marketing this? How's it going?
Christian Sheerer: It's been about three years. Really took off this year. And I joined a couple months ago.
Kush Shah: Yeah. Okay. Okay. Are you, you know, do you have co-founder status or like what's going on.
Christian Sheerer: With the No, no, no. There's, we're all co-founders here, Kush. No, there are two that are really, right, they're the co-founders. One of them came from Stripe, sorry, not Stripe, Airbnb. One of them came from the industrial space, Stanley Black & Decker. So that's sort of where we're at.
Kush Shah: Yeah. Okay. what is, what is your background? And because you said you've sold software for quite a while, right? Yeah, yeah, I worked at Rippling.
Christian Sheerer: Oh, okay.
Kush Shah: They, they sent me a little Stanley Cup just for. Oh, sick. Yeah, yeah, they have the best marketing team.
Christian Sheerer: They send a bunch of stuff all the time. They were giving out free Nintendo switches at some point.
Kush Shah: Yeah, I remember.
Christian Sheerer: What?
Kush Shah: That's crazy.
Zak George: Yeah, people, people get airpod maxes, too.
Christian Sheerer: It was crazy. They'd hop on a demo and they're like, hey, I'm here because they said I would give me an airpod Max. I'm like, Good for lead gen, but then sometimes you get on a call, it's like, come on, bro. But yeah, it was cool. It was a cool time.
Kush Shah: Yeah. Sounds like they're booming, so good for them. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. So is your background in sales or the reason I'm asking is because like I'm on the sales grind here for a couple of my apps. So I'm just, you know, trying to get some looking at a sense of who you are and all that. Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: Background. Mine is I was at another company and then I went to Rippling. That's been my whole career.
Kush Shah: Yeah. Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: I mean, if you.
Kush Shah: I.
Christian Sheerer: This is actually the most succinct, high value recommendation. Look up Matt Redler. Look up Zazu. I think it would be very. useful for your the way that you would go to market with like a web agency, right? He has this thing called like the cold email handbook. I think that would be sick for you to use just because like your TAM is everybody who needs a website and you can think through how to like really growth hack using cold email.
Kush Shah: How do you spell Riddler? Matt. Redler.
Christian Sheerer: R-E-D red l-e-r okay.
Kush Shah: And then. Okay. Okay. Zazu. Yeah, yeah.
Christian Sheerer: He, like, posted on LinkedIn a bunch, but. And then zazu is like C-A-Z-U but with a dash in the middle of Z-A-N-Z-U I think.
Kush Shah: Okay. Okay. I'm not too worried about this one.
Christian Sheerer: Sorry. Go ahead.
Kush Shah: Yeah. What were you gonna say? Sorry. I'm not too worried I mean, about this we web got a rock agency. star in this That's call with like Zak a. over here, to be honest. And I'm more worried about this educational tech app that I'm basically marketing out to like schools, SLP, clinics, therapists, all those kind of people where it's like a hard industry to break into. But that's one. And then the other was like, I'm selling to commercial real estate firms and law firms, which is another industry to hard break into, but once you're in it, you're in it. So, yeah, that's just me talking out loud.
Christian Sheerer: Not, you'll have my contact. I mean, if you have anything that you think you want to pick our brains about when we have time, we're down for sure, because we're thinking through the same things. We're breaking into a weird industry that's hard to technologize. and so we're thinking about the same things all the time. I think that like cold email handbook is just like, that's the thing that comes to head, even if for that ed tech stuff, just because it's like, how do I personalize, get into a bunch of email inboxes in a very short amount of time and do it in a way that's sustainable? That's like where I would start. And then yeah, other sales stuff, yeah, bang my line. We can chat.
Kush Shah: Sounds good. Yeah, I was good to meet some folks that I'm software engineering for like 10 years. So it's like, it's good to meet people that know other stuff and trying to learn from them as much as I can.
Christian Sheerer: And, dude, I'm on the same boat. I'm like trying to, I'm in cursor when I go home and I'm like, yeah, what do I do? I'm on the same page as you. So, yeah, you'll have my contact. I'll drop my number in there in the case you just want to text me. call me about nickel or anything else, let me know.
Kush Shah: Definitely. Cool. Good meeting you. And yeah, look out for that tweet because cursor just deleted some guy's database and it fucked everything up.
Christian Sheerer: So that's- well, mine is tiny and so hopefully I'm not a target for them. But yeah, no, I know they're going through a little bit of a weird spin the past couple weeks.
Kush Shah: Yeah. Too much control, but we'll figure it out.
Zak George: Also, make some time, Kush.
Kush Shah: Yeah, of course. Yeah, thanks for making this introduction. So, yeah, we'll keep in touch for sure.
Christian Sheerer: Absolutely. Yeah, and if you're ever in the city, let us know.
Kush Shah: Yes, sir. Where do you live? What city?
Christian Sheerer: I'm in Brooklyn. I'm in Brooklyn.
Kush Shah: Okay, I'm in Denver. So that's a- yeah. Awesome. Thanks, guys. Have a good one.
Christian Sheerer: Talk to you later. Nice to meet you.
