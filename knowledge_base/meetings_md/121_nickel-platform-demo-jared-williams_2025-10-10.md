Jacob Greenberg: Sam. Hello, Zach.
Zak George: Hey, Jacob.
Jacob Greenberg: How you doing?
Zak George: I'm doing okay. Yourself?
Jacob Greenberg: I am also doing okay.
Zak George: I see that name. Jared accepted the invite. I also sent him an early sms.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, great.
Zak George: Hopefully he shows up.
Jacob Greenberg: Cool. How was your call with him when you first did the call? Was it good?
Zak George: Yeah, should have. Should have sent you the recording prior, but yeah, had a lot of things going on, so.
Jacob Greenberg: Oh, good. I'm sure he was pretty receptive. He was receptive, you said?
Jared: Yep.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, cool.
Jared: Awesome.
Jacob Greenberg: Oh, hopefully he pops on here.
Zak George: If not, then I'll just give him a call.
Jacob Greenberg: Alrighty. No problem. I'm gonna keep my camera off just because my WI fi is a little bit spotty and I worry with my camera on, my audio might get kind of bad.
Zak George: Same.
Jacob Greenberg: Oh, I see. Jared, can you hear us?
Zak George: Hi, Jared. I. I think you might need to unmute yourself, Jared. There's like a. A little icon showing that you're on mute.
Jared: Can you hear me now?
Jacob Greenberg: Yep, I could hear you now. How's it going?
Jared: Perfect. Well, just stepped off the job site to talk to you guys.
Jacob Greenberg: Nice. Okay, great. Well, we'll make it. Make it valuable and brief so you could get back to it. So I have half an hour on the calendar here. We could try to make it a little bit quicker, but does that work for you?
Jared: Yes, if we could wrap up by 1150, that would be fantastic.
Jacob Greenberg: Perfect. And where you. Where are you located?
Jared: I'm out in Northern Virginia.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, gotcha. Cool. All right, Jared, so typically, I like to start these calls by learning a little bit more about your business, how you guys are currently doing accounts receivable or accounts payable, and how you're managing these payments with your customers. This will help me customize the demo so that I'm only showing you things that are most important for. So can you give me a little bit of background about how you guys currently accept payments when you're setting out invoices?
Jared: Sure. So we use QuickBooks. QuickBooks for accounting, and we use out of the Box for accounting as well. Right now we use a CRM called Service Minder when we're taking credit cards. That connects to a different platform called Zift.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. Zift. Z I F T. Is that correct?
Jared: Yep, that's integrated with our current CRM. So what started this call is that I believe I'm getting charged at least 1 or 1 half percent for. What's it called? ACH.
Jacob Greenberg: Got you. So you're doing ACH through QuickBooks, is that correct?
Jared: No, through Zift.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay. Gotcha. So both credit cards and ACH are going through ZIFT. ACH is being charged about 1.5%. And then for credit cards, are you also paying the credit card fees when your customer is elected to pay by credit card?
Jared: If it's a huge amount, like if they want to do the whole job like 20,000 on it, then we pass them the fees at 3%.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha.
Jared: But if they're only paying like 6 to 7,000 on a deposit, usually we, we eat it. But then if they want to pay the rest of credit card, we put the 3% fee for them.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. And when you guys do that 3% fee, is that just doing like the manual calculations of what 3% of 20,000 is and then adding that on top on the invoice?
Jared: That's correct.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. Okay, great.
Jared: So we are a new business. We only, we've only been going around for six months now.
Jacob Greenberg: Oh, great. Congratulations. How's it going so far?
Jared: Well, the first couple months was, you know, roller coaster, train wreck. And then we start figuring out and now we're, now we're good to go. At least for now. Knock on wood. You know, we went from like zero sales. Zero sales. And then we finally figured out with the right sales guy, and now it's now we, we hover between 150 to 200 in revenue a month.
Jacob Greenberg: Nice. Very cool. And I understand that you guys are part of. It's a franchise, correct?
Jared: Yep. Through five Stars, the umbrella, and then franchisor, and then we're five star best solutions. Got you.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, cool. And did, did you guys find Zift on your own or did Five Starlight try to set you guys up with some tools to be able to take payments?
Jared: They were a vendor that they pushed.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. Okay, cool.
Jared: But you know, it's. Once again, we can choose whoever we want to go with. But that was one of the ones it's like, hey, you can use, usually get one or two options.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, perfect. Okay, so they recommended it. They gave you that as an option, but you have the autonomy to do whatever you think is best for your business when it comes to payments.
Jared: Correct? Yeah. Zift is. Zift is a vendor.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay. Okay, great. Yeah. This is going to be really quick and simple. And you guys use QuickBooks Online or QuickBooks Desktop. Okay, perfect. Yeah, I think this is going to be a really quick and simple solution for you guys. Nicole, I'll give you a quick background and then I'll show you the demo. Make sure I get you off the call in the next 24 minutes so you could be back to for the next 14 minutes so you can get back to what you're doing. But Nicole, our founder, was the head of innovation at Stanley, Black and Decker and he was working with a lot of what we call built world industries. So contractors, construction businesses that have low profit margins and tight cash flow. And he realized that a lot of the cash flow problems in these businesses was because there wasn't one unified way to be able to accept payments from customers. However, they prefer to pay and have them settle quickly with no fees. Right. So the entire idea of nickel was founded based on the idea of being able to provide optionality to customers of contracting or construction businesses typically, but without their choices taking a negative impact on the business as far as taking time to settle or as far as fees. So we wanted to make it hyper simple. A lot of businesses will have like this place to do ach, this place that does credit card, this thing for wire transfer, then they have a check machine, stuff like that. We wanted to consolidate everything into one offer in a free to use solution. So we have two platforms. One is Nickel Core and one is Nickel Plus. I'll walk you through the pricing later. I'm going to walk you through some features now real quick. All right, can you see what's the.
Jared: I can see it. What's the speed of my customer? We submit ACH or credit card. How quick does it hit my bank? Yep.
Jacob Greenberg: So here, I'll show you the pricing right here. So there's two plans. Nickel Core is free to use. Nickel plus is $35 a month and the big difference here is the time to settle. So on Nickel Core it's a three day business turnaround for ACH and on Nickel plus it's a two day business turnaround. When it comes to card for Nickel plus, it's a next day turnaround for credit card and a two day turnaround for Nickel Core.
Jared: So a side question, why does it take two days?
Jacob Greenberg: That's a good question. So we actually are coming out with a product by the end of this year which is same day deposit. It's similar like. Have you used Venmo before, Jared?
Jared: Yep.
Jacob Greenberg: You know, you know when you like cash out from Venmo you have the ability to do same day deposit and they'll charge a fee or it's a three to five day deposit otherwise sure. So we're coming up with a solution like that have a same day deposit. The two day deposit is, it's part of the security measure, we take that extra day to ensure that there's not going to be a chargeback, that there wasn't a fraudulent attempt, that it's not a high risk transaction for you or your business.
Jared: Gotcha. Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: And one of the reasons here, and this is to go more into the ethos of what nickel is all about. Many merchant services providers, I'm not sure about Zift, I haven't experienced zift before. It's the first time I've heard of them, to be honest with you. But many merchant services providers have trouble transacting large transactions. So if you're looking at $25,000 or up per transaction, even $15,000 and up per transaction, merchant services providers will take that transaction, even if it's ach, they'll take three to four days to process it. Then they'll put it under fraud review for two to three days and then they'll send the deposit and take another two or three days to settle. And when it does settle, sometimes what will happen is because they're on outdated payment rails, that $25,000 deposit is hitting your bank account as five $5,000 deposits. What nickel is able to do, because we're built on more advanced, more modern payment rails, we call it industrial strength Payment for the built world industries is we can transact an unlimited amount in a single transaction and it'll settle on a one to one ratio. So if you did a $500,000 transaction, it'll settle the same two days and it'll settle in your account as a single $500,000 transaction. And that's because we have updated security measures that enables us to, in that one to two day period, provide the security required to process that transaction without having to put it on pause for like another seven days like pretty much every other merchant service provider does.
Jared: All right, so $35 a month, unlimited free. Ach. I mean that's nice. I mean the timing of it is not the craziest. But three business days, is that standard or is it like sometimes 2, sometimes 5?
Jacob Greenberg: With 35amonth, it's two day business turnaround. It's pretty consistent two day business turnaround. The one thing to know is that the cutoff times because of banks are 4pm so if the payment is sent at 6pm Technically that transfer will begin the next day. That's the one caveat to be aware of. That's a banking industry still with that.
Jared: Technology was like Swift, that it's kind of changing all that.
Jacob Greenberg: Say that again.
Jared: Just banking that shuts off at 4pm it's old technology.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah.
Jared: I'm not saying like this is just in general, I mean like I'm just waiting for like the Swift takeover and like, you know, blockchain that is going to improve all this stuff.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah. I don't know how much Swift has to do with the banking cutoff times. I'm not super familiar with that, but I do know that we actually have tech in place that we're developing and partners we're working with. We're hoping by the end of this year and don't hold me to that specifically, but at least within the quarter, we're really hoping to try to extend these hours to be a little bit later in the afternoon. There's some other protocols that we think we can enact, but our whole thing here is helping push forward the advancement of Payment Rails. It's outdated. It's been kind of the same Payment Rails for a really long period of time. Cryptocurrency is exciting. It's not what we do. That's something I'm more personally interested in. But we're hoping that with ACH checks, credit cards, typical payment methods, the technology to be able to move higher value transactions more securely and more quickly is what we want to pioneer and more affordably too. You'll see a lot of places are taking the 1.5% transaction value. We're offering it unlimited for free. The one thing I would highlight is that the difference between Nickel Core, which is free, and Nickel plus, which is 35amonth, is Nickel Core will cap you at $25,000 per transaction. So if you do occasionally have higher value transactions above that or you want that one day faster turnaround time, you're going to want to sign up for Nickel Plus. The great thing is you can sign up with Core, test out the solution when you're ready to get the value of the better turnaround time or the higher transaction limit. You can upgrade on your own from within the platform whenever you want. So go for it.
Jared: I'm just trying to figure out how you guys make money if I do ach with you guys.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, it's a great question and I'll this is going to be much more clear once I show you what the finished invoice looks like for your customer. But when your customers elect to pay by credit card, we take a percentage of the credit card percentage as well. And we just think it's fair and honest business. It it's enough to support us to be able to continue to do what we do. Ultimately, what we want to do is create more products that create cash flow advantages in the future for our customers. So we're talking about net terms or trade credit products. But for now, just about 22% of the time when nickel companies send out invoices, their customers elect to pay those invoices via credit card, even if they're very large transactions, because it provides a cash flow advantage. A lot of our businesses are business to business entities and that is enough for us to be able to continue maintaining the platform and developing new products. We just think it's fair and honest business and antithetical to the rest of the payments industry, which is trying to nickel and dime everybody to death.
Jared: So I take a $10,000 in a credit card, you charge me two point or, you know, 2.9% and then you charge the customer a percentage. Nope.
Jacob Greenberg: I'll show you right now. If you can see my screen here, I'm just going to create an invoice and show you what this looks like. All right?
Jared: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: The first thing to note though is when you do come into nickel, I'm going to do a quick walkthrough. You'll have the summary tab of your most recent transactions, your transactions tab, where you can see all the basic information about the money flow within your business. QuickBooks will be your ultimate accounting system. Nickel is going to be where you have easier, better visibility into the flow of money in and out of your business, whether it's for accounts receivable or for accounts payable. You can manage all of that from here. And the first thing you're going to want to do is go into settings, update your logo so it's in your banner, so it's all branded to your company and your business, and then pop into the integrations tab and sync QuickBooks. The first time you sync QuickBooks is going to take about five to six minutes in order to sync. And then after you sync QuickBooks, it's going to be an instantaneous, automatic, two way transfer of information for every transaction that you guys have. So if you guys currently create those invoices from within QuickBooks, they'll automatically populate here within Nickel and you'll be able to highlight all of them and click Send or Filter. For the ones that aren't sent yet, press Apply and send them all at once. Now I'm just going to quickly walk through what it looks like if you were to create the invoice from within QuickBooks, I mean from within NIFL. So I'm just going to add you as a five star bath solution as.
Jared: So, so right, right now we create our invoices through our CRM, right? And then we click a button and press Sold and Zift knows to charge it. Or do I have to go on your platform, create an invoice every time separately.
Jacob Greenberg: Right, so here, give me one second here. Sorry about that. So when you create these invoices on your CRM, is that invoice information getting synced back to QuickBooks at any point?
Jared: Yes.
Jacob Greenberg: So if you do have an API sync from your CRM to QuickBooks and then you sync your QuickBooks to Nickel. Essentially QuickBooks will be your source of truth for your accounting system. And everything you create within your CRM or your ERP will go through QuickBooks and then auto populate within Nickel. So you can create the invoice from your ERP or your CRM go into Nickel, and that invoice will have been created inside Nickel as well, having been pushed through QuickBooks. So it's going to sync all of your systems together and any of the line item invoices. So if you do have PDFs and line item invoices that are generated from your ERP CRM or from QuickBooks, they'll automatically be attached here in the upload documents section when that invoice is auto generated within Nickel. Does that make sense?
Jared: That's a little over my head. But the main thing I need is figure out if this is programmable with our CRM of service minder and if it makes it, if it.
Jacob Greenberg: Like I just can't be making my.
Jared: Life more, more difficult if I have to do a second step.
Jacob Greenberg: Let me simplify my answer for you. If you have service miners synced with QuickBooks, you're going to continue to create your invoices the same way you typically do, if that's your preference, which it sounds like it is. And then when you come into NCCL, those invoices will be automatically generated and the invoice PDFs will automatically be attached. All you need to do is come in here and click Request payment.
Jared: Gotcha.
Jacob Greenberg: Yep. And let me show you what that actually looks like. So for today's purposes, I'm just going to create a test from within Nickel. But remember you're. You don't have to do it this way. You'll be creating it from whatever system you want to because they're all going to be synced together. So I'll do 5 star bath demo. As a new customer, I'm going to put my email address here so I can show you what it looks like to receive the invoice. I'm going to put the invoice amount. If you wanted to do recurring invoices, you could, but it seems like with your business it's mostly going to be one time invoices. You'll have the invoice date, the creation date and the due date as well. So do you guys ever do like 30, 60 day net terms?
Jared: No.
Jacob Greenberg: No. So you can do the due date for the same day you put any notes for. The customer will go here. And this is where your invoice line items are going to be populated from QuickBooks or from your CRM service minder. You could also add any other documents you want. This is actually really nice and unique tool. It's going to be able to consolidate all of your communications with your customer in a single place. So if you want photos of the job site, any contractual agreements you have with them, any specific documentation you want to exist on a link that they can always access. It's a very nice way to consolidate your communications with your customer and provide them a very easy branded experience for your business. Some other advanced features before I create this invoice. And you can do this on a universal level for all of your invoices or on an invoice by invoice basis, you can enable the customer to edit the payment amount. So if you do have a $30,000 invoice, you could give them the option to pay part by credit card and part by ach. You could also customize fees on the payment request. Like you said, if it's a larger transaction for credit card, you'll put the 2.9% on the customer. If it's not as large and they want to pay by credit card, you guys might need that fee. Most nickel businesses will put the 100% of the cost of using credit card onto their customer because they have the option to pay by ach, which incurs no fees, or to pay by credit card which would incur fees. However, if you do want to split it, you can customize this however you would like. So you could split this fee 50, 50 with your customer or you could put 100. Say that again.
Jared: You're talking about the 2.9%. You could, you're saying you could split that?
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, you could customize it however you want to on a universal level for all your invoices or on a one by one, case by case basis.
Jared: Gotcha.
Jacob Greenberg: I'm going to head and create this invoice. If you do have the customer payment information on file already, you can add it and just go ahead and charge the customer right away. You could also schedule charges in advance. So we do have a good amount of businesses that when they get a new customer and a new project, they'll send one invoice with the deposit and they'll collect the information from the customer and schedule the payment for the balance when the project is due and will auto withdraw Otherwise. You could send these individual invoices by email or by text message. Text message is convenient if you're accepting payment in field. For now I'm just going to. Since I can't show you my phone, I will send this as an email to myself and I'll show you what the invoice looks like. So my my demo environment, the business in there is called degrad Distribution. So this would have your business name and your invoice number. They'll have your logo and your business name. And this is actually a hyperlink which is pretty neat and gives a nice branded experience. It'll go back to your website. Let's say you have a new payment request here, the total amount, who it's from, invoice number and any notes that you want. All of the attachments will show up in this payment portal once I click this button. But they're also going to be attached to the email itself for easy access. If I go ahead and click pay now, this is what the invoice will look like again. Your branded logo, your company name will go here. Your email address will go here. All of the PDFs and line item invoices will be downloadable from here. You'll have the total amount, any notes for the customer, the due date and the payment amount. Here you'll see the option to pay by card or to pay by bank. And should they elect to pay by bank, you'll see that there's no fees associated. And that's for both you and your customer. If they do choose to pay by card, there will be the 2.99% fee, however you decide to split it with that customer. But you can kind of see here why nickel businesses will put the entire fee onto the customer. Because they have the ability to pay without incurring any fee whatsoever by choosing ach. Or they have the ability to get a cash flow advantage for themselves by paying the 2.99% fee. And at this point most people have 2 to 3% rewards or cash back cards. So kind of cancels out. Now one thing to call out about this fee for the credit card Processing is that once the payment is made, that fee is attached on this end and it's going to be removed before it hits your bank. So there's no. No more of the manual having to calculate what that fee would be, updating the invoice manually and then accounting for it later. Inside your accounting system. We're going to add it on this end and remove it before it hits your bank. So you just have to charge the customer exactly what they owe and not have to worry about doing any of the manual processes around processing fees.
Jared: Gotcha.
Jacob Greenberg: And it's very straightforward. I know I'm talking kind of quickly. I just want to make sure you get back to your job site in the time that you allotted me to do the demo.
Jared: Sorry, I'm just driving there now. So I'm still looking down and listening to it. But um, yeah, the main thing is I'm really interested in the 0% ACH. Is there a limit per month of how much that is?
Jacob Greenberg: There is not.
Jared: Okay. So I think probably the next step is I'll get a hold of the person in my company who deals with all the integrations and ask them what they think about this because I think they'd be interested in the 0% ACH as well.
Jacob Greenberg: Awesome. So who. So that I have a, a name to go by. Who in the. Who in your company is responsible for those integrations?
Jared: Man, now you caught me on the spot. Here it is. Last name McQueen. What is her first name? I don't know. Trying to think of it right now.
Jacob Greenberg: Does she work with you in, in your office? She works with a franchisor with the franchise. Okay. Okay, great.
Jared: So.
Jacob Greenberg: So yeah, I would be happy to set up a call to explain the solution to her as well. Walk her through it. And I'll also bring on Crystal. Crystal McQueen. It's a great name. If she, if she wants to get a walkthrough on a technical side about how the integrations would work, what I think would be the best step there is setting up a follow up call and I'll bring somebody from my technical team to walk her through it.
Jared: Yeah, I mean if she's interested, I mean that's the. She's the one who solves all our issues on the CRM side. And then, so I mean that's like all. You know, there's a hundred of us businesses that are attached to that. So yeah, if you guys sell her and it makes sense to the business, I mean that's the, that's the big ticket.
Jacob Greenberg: That'd be Great. I mean, really on if I'm just talking to you and instead of the entire entity right now, what are your feelings about the solution and what I've showed you? Like, on a scale from 1 to 10, if this was all in your house and not within crystals, how would you feel?
Jared: 1 to 10? I. I need to make sure I'm not adding more work than I need to with the CRM integration. Right. Like, I just want to be able to click the button and. And it goes right to like, I don't want to change that much on what I'm doing. Right. So if I have to then create. It doesn't sound like I'm creating any new invoices, but I don't mind creating one extra step if it's, you know, saving us money. But if I'm creating a whole bunch of steps, then that would be an issue. And then the second part, I really like the zero. I mean the 3% credit card, I feel like that's the same, but the 0% ach. And I just feel like less and less people are going to be carrying checks. So yeah, going through routing numbers makes more sense.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. Sounds good. Oh, one thing I didn't mention is that on that payment page we are activating the ability to pay via Apple Pay. So if you do in person payments for these transactions, it's as easy as just double clicking on the phone when you send the invoice via text.
Jared: But most of my customers are 50 plus, so I don't even think they know what Apple Pay is.
Jacob Greenberg: Well, in that case. Ach, it's. You're right. It's like kind of a digital check at that point. So it sounds like if we do have a seamless integration with what you're currently doing, it's not adding a ton more steps. It sounds like you guys are at a 9 or 10 out of 10 for this. Barring that one, that one important step. Is that an accurate temperature?
Jared: Yeah. I mean, hey, if you're helping us save money and we save money by getting the ACH at zero and then we pay the same amount in credit cards and I think that's fair. And you're not charging the customer any extra than the 2.9. Correct?
Jacob Greenberg: That's correct. And I mean, I know this might seem a little bit small, but do you see any value in like the credit card processing being a little bit more automated and easier to do instead of the manual updating of the fees?
Jared: What do you mean? Oh, you're. Because you're already Adding it in there? Yeah, yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: Instead of you having to do calculations on each one, add it after the fact, and then account for that inside your accounting system. It just being able to easily split 50, 50, 75, 25, or put 100% on them automatically, does that have any convenience impact for you?
Jared: Yeah, I mean, hey, we'll take it. I don't even know if I can do that now with the current software we have. But yeah, if you have that, sure, that'd be nice.
Jacob Greenberg: Awesome. And are the settlement times relatively similar or is it a little bit faster?
Jared: I think at three days it's probably similar, but it feels like it takes a little bit longer. But you're talking about three business days. So if someone pays us on Friday, getting it probably on Wednesday.
Jacob Greenberg: So yeah, for you guys, I would actually recommend signing up with nickel plus for the auto occasion where you're going to have a transaction over 25, 000. And the side benefit of that is that you're going to have one day faster settlement time. It'll be two day turnaround.
Jared: Yeah, I mean, 35 I can live with.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, great. All right, cool. So. All right, Jared, what should be our next steps here? I want to follow up with you after you have a conversation with Crystal. Do you. Is that going to be something that will happen like within a week or within a month? What is your timeline for that?
Jared: I would say probably. Probably like two weeks.
Jacob Greenberg: Two weeks. Okay, gotcha. Would it make sense for me to set a follow up reminder on my calendar to connect with you two Fridays from now? And what we can do with that is if you need to reschedule, feel free to let me know. But if you do want Crystal to join that call and she's available to do so, I will also invite someone from my tech team. So we could have everybody there together and we could just set that date to discuss if it makes sense to.
Jared: That sounds good.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, fantastic. All right, so I have here the best email for you is jared.williams@fivestarbathsolutions.com Set fit.
Jared: That's correct.
Jacob Greenberg: Can I send an invite for 3:00pm on Friday the 24th?
Jared: Sure.
Jacob Greenberg: Great. And we could pivot again if you need to. So I'm going to send that out. Only thing I ask. I know you're driving, but whenever you do check your email if you can accept the calendar invite. It just prevents me from getting double booked, which does occasionally happen.
Jared: Fair enough.
Jacob Greenberg: Awesome. All right, Jared, I'm happy we made some time today.
Jared: Thank you for your time. I know, this is a free consultation going on, so thanks for. Thanks for doing it.
Jacob Greenberg: Nope. Happy to. And, you know, happy to work with customers that I think the impact is going to be significant for. So as long as if we do end up working well together and it is good for your business, as long as I could reach out to you maybe once in the future, get a good review from you, that would be fantastic.
Jared: Yeah. All good.
Jacob Greenberg: All right.
Jared: All right.
Jacob Greenberg: Have a good day. I know. You too. Have a good one. And have a good weekend. See you, Jared.
