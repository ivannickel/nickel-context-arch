Frank Delbrouck: Hey, good afternoon, sir. How are you doing? I'm just pulling into my driveway.
Colton O'Farrell: I'm doing well myself.
Frank Delbrouck: Traffic was a little awful today.
Colton O'Farrell: I've been there, I totally understand.
Frank Delbrouck: Okay. How are you, sir?
Colton O'Farrell: Doing well. Where are you calling from?
Frank Delbrouck: Florida, actually, sir.
Colton O'Farrell: Florida, nice. Yeah, I'm a little further. Definitely a little traffic situation.
Frank Delbrouck: Oh, God. Sometimes they are just like. I mean, this morning was already bad, but this afternoon, I didn't anticipate it, to be honest. But you know what? By there, three lanes closed. What are you gonna do? You're gonna take the alternate route. Literally. Yeah.
Colton O'Farrell: There's not a whole lot you can do there. Awesome. Well, I appreciate you hopping on the call here today, and I know you're kind of getting situated, so if you need to pause to, you know, get inside or whatever, It no worries was there.
Frank Delbrouck: Quite No, a lot it's. of calls and following. The reason of why I'm establishing the call, I mean, I have been, I have joined Getnick & Kelly for a little while now, I should say two weeks, but apparently I got an email this morning after review of the application that canceled the account. So I'm really trying to figure out here what's going on because I don't know if you have all the information and data there, but I want to give you that. And I'm trying to find out what the hell happened. Because I transferred, I mean, I did transfer last night a small, teeny little small payment from my customer, which was showing last night in processing. And I also initiated a bill pay, I think, for $125 to as one of my vendors. And all of a sudden, I get this morning the information, I can't even do anything. So I'm not quite happy, to be honest with you, at this point.
Colton O'Farrell: I can understand, yeah. I mean, I just let you know that it is separate from me. I do have access to be able to see accounts, but in terms of we have a regulatory and compliance team that has a separate process. There's federal regulations, there's the Bank Secrecy Act, know your customer laws, anti-money laundering regulations. So I know there's a lot of different pinpoints there that could potentially could be a reason for denial. I don't have the information like I said.
Frank Delbrouck: The dial information. I'm just questioning of course how I can get to that.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, of course.
Frank Delbrouck: Yeah, let's talk about it. I have a business which does referral services and do consulting. And obviously, I mean, I established the account maybe 10 days ago or maybe 14 days, not quite as long. And I'm in the beginning stages. Obviously, my transaction volume is very low at this point still. But I'm anticipating, of course, a quite flux in the next couple of months. And, you know, I love Nickel, number one. Number two is I started referring people out and saying, hey, this is a great platform, but now I'm going across this obstacle. And I'm not doing anything non-compliant in any form or shape. You know, I have QuickBooks attached to it, as you may see or may not see. I've done, you know, a little bit of setup work, of course. putting the logo in place, da da da da da. But here we go, you know, I transfer or try to process attemptingly with one of my customers, the first so-called invoice, which went out, everything went fine, couple of integration questions, of course, but other than that, you know, all of a sudden I get this morning email, I'm like, oh God, what happened? Now I can't access it no more.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, I just want some questions for clarification on my end. So when you, I see that you created the account, it looks like 8-6 here, you linked your bank account. I do see that there was a transaction or two that was attempted here. Can you tell me a little bit more about the bank that you're using? Did you also verify via Plaid when you connected your bank account? Or what was that process like, if you recall?
Frank Delbrouck: It was Chase. Chase is my bank. I have a personal as well as business. I hooked it up to my business account, which I should do. And that's how it's also integrated into QuickBooks. I had not a problem as far as the connectivity between Plaid verification turned.
Colton O'Farrell: On for you as well with that, or was it disabled? Do you recall?
Frank Delbrouck: Say one more time.
Colton O'Farrell: Plaid verification when you were connecting your bank account where the separate Plaid screen pops up, you enter your phone number, email, whatever kind of confirming information you need. Was that enabled for you, or did you just simply add your Chase bank account?
Frank Delbrouck: I added the Chase account. I don't know what you're talking about as far as confirmation.
Colton O'Farrell: We use Vlad to verify bank accounts.
Frank Delbrouck: I think that came through, yes. I believe so it came through because I entered all the information at the time when I connected the bank account. And it gave me then the option, of course, which accounts I want to connect to.
Colton O'Farrell: How old is the company and how old is this like business bank account? I know you said you have a personal banking account with Chase. Sometimes there it is like if it's like a really short, you know, like a bank account, like newly created or business, sometimes that can throw some wrenches. What can you tell me a little bit more? I see on the website here, it looks like you were established.
Frank Delbrouck: Sure. February 5th, I went official. Bank account established, I would say six weeks or so, or eight weeks maybe.
Colton O'Farrell: Six weeks after the business was established.
Frank Delbrouck: Or six weeks ago now from this timeframe backwards. so, like, two months, basically.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, that might be one caveat there. How have you, have you been billing anyone through that, that business bank account yet? Billing as far as invoicing?
Frank Delbrouck: Neither or accounts receivable, accounts payable. Have you had money?
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, I pay bills. I pay bills.
Frank Delbrouck: But, I mean, it's not like, you know, I've, I mean, I didn't write, I have to write a check. So most of my things were done through the credit card as far as purchases and so forth, and then try to buy back to the credit. I mean, to the debit account, which is the perfect way, the tracking. So I could anchor all that in there. Had not had a problem paying someone, had not a problem of, I don't know, receiving at this point in time.
Colton O'Farrell: So my expectation would be, yeah, sorry to cut you off there. My understanding of kind of would probably be the first thing was just the age of the account and when it's tied to a new company, as well. If there's not. Yep, exactly. If there's not a ton of like transaction volume in there, that would most likely be the reason for some kind of denial. So you are able to like appeal the decisions from our team to do so. Really, you're emailing our support@getnickel.com, they likely are going to request specific information like social security number, three months of bank statements.
Frank Delbrouck: I mean, it's all there. Yeah, all the information is there, company wise, text ID number, EIN, all that kind of stuff. So that was all provided at the time when it was, you know, putting the application, I guess in. And that's why I was like, okay, what is missing there? Yeah. So it would be nice if they're saying denial, okay, then put the account on hold, but, you know, give the customer a chance. This is just feedback for you. you know, supply number one, a phone number, which is not even in the first email. And they're like, okay, I'm in shock. I'm sitting in the car and going. And I'm like, okay, this is not good because I wanted to make sure number one, my one customer gets paid as well as I get paid, which is, like I said, nothing big dollar wise in transaction fluctuation wise. And I was like asking, you know, people of mine, which I know as well, I said, okay, could it be with the account volume? Could it be just too small? Could it be, you know, I was immediately kind of questioning them things, because I and know that's I had a why couple I of emails from you guys, hey, let's jump on the call, get to know a demo, get to know these things. And it's a great follow through. But on this portion, hey, I get one blank basically email, you're a Nickel team, hey, we canceled your stuff, everything is canceled, can't access the account, can't do nothing, you're left in the dark. So that's kind of really a little kind of like, okay, they should say, maybe put it on hold, initiate figure a out call, what's the problem and that would be really great, but it's not the case.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, no, I can completely understand the situation you're in and just the frustration from the lack of like clarification from the team. Unfortunately, there's not a whole lot I can, like I mentioned before, there are federal regulations that they have to follow. I also only have so much insight into what their process is for my safety, for the company safety, everyone's there. What my best recommendation would be, so I'm happy to share the kind of conversation we've had with the team, but your best recommendation would be to email support@getnickel.com.
Frank Delbrouck: Yeah, I will do that. Give me one second. I don't know if I switch off my car and if it still sounds good. No worries.
Colton O'Farrell: Of course, no worries.
Frank Delbrouck: Okay. Oh, you know, Okay, yep. Sometimes.
Colton O'Farrell: Just for a moment, but I think you're back, so.
Frank Delbrouck: Okay. Give me one second. I want to get into the house so I can sit down and look at the computer and talk to you a for a brief moment. Of course. I'm sorry about this. It just talked to me.
Colton O'Farrell: Let's see, you're frozen on my end. I'm not sure if you can hear me. Oh, there you go.
Frank Delbrouck: Yes, I can hear you.
Colton O'Farrell: Okay. Yeah, so Frank, my recommendation would be to email support@getnickel.com, letting them know that, hey, I received a denial that you're unable to support my business. I was requesting more information. Why? If there's anything I can provide from like a letter of authenticity for my bank, social security number, government issued ID, whatever you guys need to verify my account, I think this was made by mistake and I'm happy to provide the necessary information you need to reevaluate my account would be my best recommendation.
Frank Delbrouck: Beautiful. So that's what we'll definitely take into action. Let me ask you two, three questions because I mean about the integration between QuickBooks and Nickel and issuing the invoicing portion, which I, yeah, yeah, yeah. Luckily it's a good customer of mine. I said, listen, hey, I'm going through a new payment vendor and I highly recommend them because number one, hey, I'm going to use ACHs and blah, blah, blah. So I promoted you guys. Appreciate that. Also to, you know, another accounting company, which is possibly interesting in transferring it over to other clients out there. So here you go, you know, I'm trying to do my my deed.
Colton O'Farrell: Of course, much appreciated.
Frank Delbrouck: Listen, you guys want to grow too. Exactly. Yes, don't do it.
Colton O'Farrell: Don't we all.
Frank Delbrouck: Exactly. So QuickBooks does a beautiful thing as far as, hey, it's showing me a portion of integration. See, now I don't have a computer and can tell you exactly the bullet points I had.
Colton O'Farrell: I'm quite well versed with the QuickBooks, like online fields and kind of functionality workflows. So we have a lot of customers who are operating on them. So I can visualize for the most part.
Frank Delbrouck: The one thing which is when I did initiate initially the invoice portion in QuickBooks, not a nickel, and inputted the customer, inputted invoice, inputted all the information, when it comes to the payment portion and saying, okay, well, you are having this vendor, meaning get nickel. Oh, here we go with the invoice. In my case, I don't know, $29.40 or whatever it was. Really not much. Doesn't really matter. And there is a separate link that you can then forward to the customer at that point. Is it necessary?
Colton O'Farrell: So what's the best workflow solution with a customer, a Nickel customer who's utilizing QuickBooks Online? Is one you'd connect your QuickBooks Online account? There is like once the integration is connected, there's a little field that pops up below where it says, like turn on automation. If you do that, anytime an invoice is generated within QuickBooks Online, so you create the invoice, instead of hitting review and send, you click save. Once you do that, it's not going to send via QuickBooks, but if you have the automation turned on within Nickel, we automatically bring that invoice in and send it off to your customer. Even if the automation is turned off, what we'll do is once and you then hit you save would simply in QuickBooks, have to go into Nickel, we'll.
Frank Delbrouck: Click bring that invoice request into Nickel payment. And and send it from there. Exactly. Exactly. And that's what I figured out because.
Colton O'Farrell: I sent the customer actually two of them. I said, listen, I'm experimenting around. You gotta save the invoice rather than review and send, otherwise it's gonna be sent twice from QuickBooks and Nickel.
Frank Delbrouck: And then get it from QuickBooks, they're gonna charge you 1% to 2% on that ACH fee. Yeah, yeah, When I'm yeah. on Well, the that's nickel what side, I and shut did it off there, there. it worked I beautifully. said, listen, So I don't it's wanna just like I use said, your payment a separate services there. And that's the thing which I did. basically platform, software platform. I come from an industry there, by the way, in the background. And I guess the integrational points between the two of them, it's perfectly fine. So once then you show the invoice there, it says, okay, invoice sent. The next process would be then processing. Because obviously the receiving party has done their deed, filled in their bank information, sent the payment basically through at that point in time it shows processing. Is that my correct understanding?
Colton O'Farrell: Yes, yeah, it would. And it would show specifically whether it was a credit card, if it was ACH processing, it would be reflected within Nickel. Whatever is reflected in Nickel, if you have that integration, it's going to match up with QuickBooks Online. Same thing, if something's in QuickBooks Online, so that wonderful it's reconciliation. going to show up in Nickel I.
Frank Delbrouck: Just don't as well. know what showed. I mean, it should just processing in that particular, I would say it should look like an Excel spreadsheet in a way.
Colton O'Farrell: Or.
Frank Delbrouck: I'm sorry, my cat is crying in the background.
Colton O'Farrell: I'll get. I got two of them myself.
Frank Delbrouck: It's. It's. It's a little, little teeny little kitten. So, of course, they want our attention. Yeah.
Colton O'Farrell: Oh, my gosh. I don't know if I could go through the kitten stage again. That's just. There's so. I had, like, by the 10 time the plants kitten stage and. is over, we only had one survive.
Frank Delbrouck: So, yeah, three x's I know, I know. But it's good they needed it. So as far as the nickel portion, I understand. So once the customer does do their payment, and I don't know get the ending, obviously, because of this situation I'm currently in, let's say it shows then processed, obviously the payment then goes show paid in QuickBooks, wherever you anchored it into, is that basically the reconciliation, I'm sorry, I can't find it.
Colton O'Farrell: Reconciliation?
Frank Delbrouck: Correct. Or is it actually just basically saying, okay, the invoice got paid, let's go into QuickBooks and do the work? Because I know some of them do have the seamless integration portion and some of them don't.
Colton O'Farrell: I know we have integration, so whatever's done in Nickel generally is gonna be reflected within QuickBooks Online within like a second.
Frank Delbrouck: So it's a couple of for days us.
Colton O'Farrell: For or, us, it's you know, like immediate. It's whatever is done in there, it's going to immediately pop up in nickel in QuickBooks as well. So there's no delay or lagging like days or anything like that.
Frank Delbrouck: Hold on. I got a lot of stuttering going on. I don't know what's happening here. All good.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah here maybe if I turn this.
Frank Delbrouck: Off it might help hold on yeah no I have your own Wi-Fi now but I'm going to make sure it's not he wants are you there Frank yes I am now I am okay.
Colton O'Farrell: Cool yeah no worries I'll turn off my camera if that's more helpful for.
Frank Delbrouck: You no no it was it was probably on my end because I have one instead of a 2.5 and the other one is I'm sorry 2.4 and the other one is a 5g.
Colton O'Farrell: Switching between the two.
Frank Delbrouck: Yeah, sometimes you have to do that. Sometimes it's just like all this technology stuff.
Colton O'Farrell: Lots of opportunity for things to not work properly. So I gotcha.
Frank Delbrouck: Well, I did. Yeah. I mean, for me, this is probably, you know, pretty crystal clear. I don't see anything as of yet because I'm just, like I said, still brand new of the fresh green behind my ear. I would love to continue the opportunity, obviously, with Nickel. I just have to figure out here what what's the deal to get this rectified and figure out what's happening to these particular payments and receiving portions that I have already established since, you know, like I said, the last 24 hours. And I can't even check what the status is in QuickBooks. Even some says paid. Well, I know it takes time till it shows that actually in the bank. Now, I don't know if that's the same situation it's showing on Nickel.
Colton O'Farrell: So again, I can't double verify processing on our end. Credit card payments generally ACH are reflected processing same for day. our free customers, it's generally two to three days turnaround time. And then for the Nickel Plus, paying customers, it's generally same day to two day turnaround time for the ACH processing. I mean, you guys are good.
Frank Delbrouck: You guys are good. Yeah. And I didn't mind, you know, go ahead. Yeah, I was just going to say.
Colton O'Farrell: My recommendation, I don't want to sell you on it too much. You know, it sounds like you already, you know, have some excitement with Nickel using it a little bit. I want to make sure you are able to work with the regulatory and compliance team just to provide everything that's needed.
Frank Delbrouck: There.
Colton O'Farrell: You know, it's not, I've had other customers where they've gotten denied initially, they followed up, they provided the required information, and everything was all solved and fixed. So that would be my recommendation to.
Frank Delbrouck: Provide, yeah, simply email them support. And can I request a call or do I request everything via email done? Do you know what the process is?
Colton O'Farrell: I would say email because they're going to want you to send like documentation, and they're not going to be able to verify that on an actual call. They'll most likely call you if needed to verify certain details, but I would say follow up via email, say, you know, I'm happy to provide anything that you need, you know, social security number, government issued ID letter of authenticity from my bank, things of that nature. They will let you know if what you've sent is satisfactory or not, if there's anything additional that needs to be sent, and they will call you to confirm that information if necessary.
Frank Delbrouck: Okay, I will do these steps, Mr. Farrell, I do appreciate certainly your time, don't wanna take off too much of your time, we still have 12 minutes, but I think, you know what, till I have that particular issue resolved and see again, portfolio wise what I have there. I mean, I can talk all day long about my business, that's not your cup of tea. I certainly wanted to see, you know, branding wise, what I, you know, there was another suggestion I actually had, When it asked you, I think it was the hold on. Oh, yeah. Tell your customer, I think, how you would like to get paid or something like that. I think this was in one of those windows, I should say, that you can fill in. And I was asking the team, okay, can there be the window basically or the platform? Can that be edited besides just the logo and the banner, which I think is in there?
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, you're talking about the payment portal.
Frank Delbrouck: I think so, yes.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, so that's customizable. So you mentioned you can change the name, the logo, the banner in the background for our paid subscribers in the Nickel Plus account. We can also change the URL or domain. We don't allow that for the free version. That's a paid subscription. Most of our customers will take that link, they'll embed it in their own website. Some of them will take it and turn it into like a QR code if they're doing on the job site.
Frank Delbrouck: Work.
Colton O'Farrell: But yes, it is customizable just to varying degrees if you are a customer. Right, I'm using, yeah, I'm not a.
Frank Delbrouck: Paid customer at this point yet. That was probably what you wouldn't be.
Colton O'Farrell: Able to adjust would be the URL or domain, but everything else you'd be able to customize.
Frank Delbrouck: Okay, so this is definitely, you know, this was for me a follow-up question between what I experienced on the free platform. Definitely, you know, that there is, because I mean, I've seen all sorts of other, you know, opportunities out there. But, you know, like I said, I would love to have the opportunity continuing. It's just a question how quickly what this paperwork can be resolved they will need. So and my done. next step is definitely doing this email to support and figuring it out from there. I don't know how quickly they can respond because it's already like what? Five o'clock almost here.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, and our office is based in New York, so they're Eastern Time.
Frank Delbrouck: Okay, so our time. So, you know, I'm not going to die until I don't get today the answer, but certainly would like to pursue and continue my platform. Now, as far as referral and referring the company of Nickel Out, which I have been trying to streamline and do, I know the referral fee, there was two different mentioned. One was for the accountant, I believe, or accounting companies, and the other one was basically for businesses. Is it per each occurrence that they use it and is it trackable or is it nothing that I can track?
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, so let me just go ahead and share my screen here in just a moment.
Frank Delbrouck: I don't feel bad that I have you just on the phone. Usually I sit on my laptop. Oh good, yeah.
Colton O'Farrell: I'll just zoom in so you can see it.
Frank Delbrouck: It's fine. Yeah.
Colton O'Farrell: But yeah, so we have the $250 bonus for a business that signs up with your referral link via Nickel. We do pay out $250 for a business after their first transaction, and then $750 for an accounting or bookkeeping firm after they made 10 payments of at least $250 each.
Frank Delbrouck: Got you, exactly. And that's what I saw. So is that something I can track at that point in time? Because I mean, if I use, so to speak, that referral link, I mean, obviously I sent that already to two different companies. Is it something that I see, oh yeah, they clicked on it, is it something I can follow through and follow up?
Colton O'Farrell: I don't believe there's like tracking visibility on your side. On our end, what it would show is it would say we have a new customer signed up and they were referred by It would say, if they use your link, it's going to be tied to that directly. So it's important if the customer signs up, if they sign up via the under that link. Yep, exactly. The referral link itself.
Frank Delbrouck: Exactly. And that's what I was trying to figure out, like, okay, is there some.
Colton O'Farrell: Sort of, you know, what were the companies that you referred to, Nickel already?
Frank Delbrouck: If you were curious on that. Yeah, two different companies, which I'm, you know, doing, and they are doing them business, and I'm going to ask them to portion use my referral which I can pay my referral fee.
Colton O'Farrell: They probably haven't signed up then yet.
Frank Delbrouck: Not yet. It's just because we're in the beginning of talks, like I said, and I'm trying to promote you guys through different networks that I enjoy and even larger entities. So that might be of beneficial portions to you guys. So again, I mean, it's just like, you know, I'm exploring the capability of expanding that and saying, okay, listen, I'm being compensated for that portion too, doing the sales portion for you guys because that's what basically And it is. A little because teeny. I will come across plenty of business opportunities where other businesses will need a new payment platform. I deal with a lot of newcomers, new business startups, things like that as well in that nature. From the construction field all the way to, oh gosh, it names different venues. I have about 24 different categories, yes sir. Nice.
Colton O'Farrell: Well, let's not let the horse get too far ahead of the cart here. Let's get the support issue figured out, make sure that we get everything verified. Once we have that, then I mean everything past that point, once the account is good to go, we'll be smooth sailing. You'll be able to refer any of your businesses over to Nickel. We don't have those, so you can get additional payouts for those. And we would of course very much appreciate it. I just don't want to commit to over anything when there's You know, obviously the regulatory compliance team that before I, you know, get hopes hopes up or anything here. So I got you.
Frank Delbrouck: No, no, it's not a problem. I mean, everything is official. Uh, everything is really the way it should be. I don't know if it's maybe a number which was off or something that was maybe missed in any form or shape, or they have overlooked something. Again, it's just a question of what it is.
Colton O'Farrell: And I need to find out, obviously. So, yeah, I wish I could give you more insight into that. But unfortunately, due to ours, They think my the less safety, information the that's company safety, out there, the better. they I just kind of know the overall process that they go through. I've had customers who've been denied. They appeal it, they get approved. It's just yeah, I couldn't tell you what the reasoning was, but I do know that there is potential to have that changed. It's just working on it.
Frank Delbrouck: Let me ask you this one. Could it be the volume?
Colton O'Farrell: You know, it could be related to how new the account is. It could be the volume. It could be related to the business. if, you know, I'm not entirely sure what their, what all criteria they're looking through. I know that they have databases that they look through, all kinds of international, federal, like national registries, like there's a lot of stuff that they do on their end. I just, I don't know to what extent.
Frank Delbrouck: All right. I certainly understand, Mr. Farrell. I do appreciate the input and I will pursue that as soon as we get off the phone, basically, in the next half an hour, send an email. Sounds great. And then go from there. And if I need down the road again, you know, some sort of consultation or advice, can I turn or to you directly or.
Colton O'Farrell: Can I say, so I've already sent you an email, so you should have my email information. Feel free to reach out there at any point. I'll be notified too, if there's any updates on the account. So I'll be free to go ahead and reach out if I notice any updates on my end as well. But let's get that step covered. Once we do, we can kind of resync on next steps and what makes the most sense.
Frank Delbrouck: I do appreciate your time. I always wish you a wonderful remaining day and week. Hopefully you get some time off now and have enough talks.
Colton O'Farrell: I know I've been in back-to-back meetings all today. So I'm ready to wrap up soon. But thanks so much, Frank. I will talk to you soon, hopefully. And yeah, thanks again for the call. And yeah, good luck with working with the support team.
