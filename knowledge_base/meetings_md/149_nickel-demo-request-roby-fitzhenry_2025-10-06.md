Jacob Greenberg: Hey, Robbie, can you hear me?
Always Creative: Yeah. How's it going? Good.
Jacob Greenberg: How are you?
Always Creative: Good.
Jacob Greenberg: Awesome. All right, I'm happy we can make some time today. I have. I have 30 minutes on my calendar. Does that still work for you?
Always Creative: Oh, yeah, it's plenty of time. Like, we can probably even be faster. You know, have some extra time, go. Have a cup of coffee.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, sounds good.
Always Creative: So, yeah. You want me to kind of jump into it, by the way? Oh, what were you saying?
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, yeah. Typically we start with just getting a little bit of background on your business. And then I know you left some notes here about QuickBooks, so if you could just do a little recap of how you guys are doing accounting and doing invoicing right now, and then how you found nickel, and then I'll customize a demo to make sure it fits you guys and your current operation go from there.
Always Creative: Cool. Yeah. So we. Everything is ran through QuickBooks online. I sent out invoices usually end of month, beginning of the month. I'll also randomly, you know, we complete a project and we'll bill. I don't accept credit card payments without a payment processing fee generally. But most of our stuff is ach. I used to be mainly checks primarily ach. And then, you know, one of our clients is like a 25, 000 per month client, and that's ACH, which is a big fee every month. Right.
Jacob Greenberg: Are you doing recurring payments for them or is it a one off invoice each time? Like, does it fluctuate? Is it exactly 25 or is it a little different?
Always Creative: It could be exactly 25. It fluctuates by about 1500. But we could. We. I mean, we've been with them for 13 years. There's like a cusp right on there. We. Well, the only thing that's different is one of their invoices. So the invoice would be like 23 to 25 every month for our retained design services. But it has a fluctuating reimbursement. Got it. Okay. You know, I mean, so that's kind of so. But I was just going through doing like basic bookkeeping was like, dude, we spent a lot of money on ACH fees.
Jacob Greenberg: Oh my God.
Always Creative: Yeah. Yeah. I cannot believe how ugly QuickBooks invoices are. But then I knew like I was going to use stripe. Dug into stripe. I was like, oh man, that's still really expensive. And I found you guys online salt free. Ach, obviously, like the website and all those things was like, okay, hey, let me reach out. And my goal Would be if we could use nickel, we could send out invoices and they look better. We not get charged to ACH. The ability to mail out a check for 2 bucks and not have to keep checks on me is awesome because I have vendors, you know, across the United States that I pay every month. And it would just be really nice to simplify that. You know what I mean? We're doing about 60 to 70, 000amonth. Sometimes we'll fluctuate up to 80 or 90. Okay. We're on the cusp between 750 to a million in revenue. Okay. Not revenue, but total sales. Okay. And so. Yeah, but we're scaling too, which is great. Until AI comes and takes all of our jobs and then we're out of here.
Jacob Greenberg: Then we got to figure out something else.
Always Creative: Yeah. Then I'm gonna start selling bean and cheese burritos. Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: Well, yeah, if you have a job for me in five years when AI takes over, you just let me know for sure.
Always Creative: Yeah. Save your store your nuts in your tree trunk for now until we're. We're doomed. No, but that's really what it is. So the idea for me is one to one portability directly into QuickBooks, where I'm not having to reconcile anything, which I saw was like, check free. No brainer. Yep. The mailing check features. Awesome. Any other things you think would be great? Like, we can set that up. We do run payroll through QuickBooks as well. And there's a way to save fees on payroll. I don't know if you all do that or not.
Jacob Greenberg: So we're not a payroll company. There are companies that use our bill pay feature to pay contractors or employees. So you can do that. You could pay them via ach, you could pay them via check. But all the other bells and whistles that go with payroll, it's not really our bread and butter. But if you're doing the very fundamental W9 stuff, you just can CSV download all the payments that you made to each vendor that you work with or each employee that you work with, and you'll be able to track it manually that way.
Always Creative: Cool. Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: And we a good amount of people that pay out their employees via nickel.
Always Creative: Okay, cool. Well, I mean, I'm down to understand, you know, the total feature stack and what you guys are up for. But to be. To be fair, if everything, somebody, one of my teammates or partners this morning was like, is this too good to be true? But no, like, if you guys can. If you guys can like do a test and help Me understand or like you said, a demo. I mean we'd love it. It seems cool. Sure. You know, I'm a, I'm a pretty transparent person. So like hey, here's the rough idea of what this cost or doesn't cost because my problem and again, it's fine, I'll eat it. But my cpa, who I've been with for a long time is really great at saving us a lot of money on taxes. I'm going to keep everything in QuickBooks online. I'm just going to do poured in and now like it's worth the $500 a month or $500 a year I'm going to pay to just keep it there in order to get the $20,000 of tax savings I'm going to get. So right that that part's fine for me.
Jacob Greenberg: We encourage that as well. So there's a reason why we integrate with QuickBooks. The majority of the people we work with have QuickBooks. QuickBooks has recently and this is slightly serendipitous to us, but to the dismay of a lot of the people that end up searching for us, is that QuickBooks is pushing for higher rates and they're trying to like hit one. It depends on how long you've been using QuickBooks. Some people are grandfathered in and but even those people just their rates are going up slower. I think their target is 1.5% for everybody using QuickBooks for ACH fees by the end of 2025. Most people are there. So I mean for you guys, what I calculate that's roughly, you know, if you're doing ACH for 70k monthly, that's probably 12,000 to 13,000 in fees on an annual basis.
Always Creative: Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: Does that seem right for you guys?
Always Creative: That seems exactly right, yeah. Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: So yeah, this is going to be easy. It's going to be a no brainer. I'll give you a little bit of background about nickel before I pop into the demo environment just so that you have an understanding of what why we are different than everybody else in the market and why we offer, why it looks too good to be true. Nickel, our founder was the director of innovation for Stanley, Black and Decker many years back. And so he realized that in that industry, in the built world, construction contracting industry, cash flow is a very serious problem. You'll have like three really big jobs a year. Maybe you spend like $400,000 on one job, get paid 600,000. It takes like two or three months for that to settle. But you need that money before you can start the next job. So a lot of that comes down to the payment Rails. And one other thing that he realizes with QuickBooks, with all these other merchant services providers, Stripe etc. They can't process transactions of that size. It takes longer to settle if something above $10,000 is transferred over via ACH or wire transfer. Takes them a week and a half to do an investigation, make sure it's legitimate for their own risk department. Once it settles, it takes another week to settle, then there's probably another investigation. It just took a lot of time and it costs a lot of money to get. So he thought that there is a better way to develop faster payment Rails that are more secure because when it comes to being able to process things more affordably and quicker, it's all about the security. So these, the reason why a lot of these organizations charge more or take longer is because they have to do more manual security checks. So we developed technology and we're benefiting from being a little bit younger and having new technology at our core from these other legacy dinosaur companies that have to transition over after like 20 years. So we have a different payment rail stack. It enables us to move more money quicker and more securely. And we do pay for the ach, so cost us money to do the ACH transfers. But what we do is we keep. Whenever a customer of our customers elects to pay in credit card, we get to keep that credit card percentage. It's passed to the customer automatically. We're presenting it in a way that gives them the option to be able to choose how they would want to pay. And for us that makes all the difference. We're still able to offer free ACH and we plan on always doing so this platform a little bit. And with that in mind, we are initially built for like the built world industries contracting and construction and the likes. But since we launched, we've been, you know, we've been around for about five years now. Accounting firms were the first companies that came after us and wanted to use us after, you know, industrial businesses. And then since then the floodgates have kind of opened. We have a lot of creative industries. Just a ton of different unique businesses are using us now.
Always Creative: Cool.
Jacob Greenberg: That's the background. That's how we're able to offer free ach and we see that as like part of our DNA. We don't plan on changing that.
Always Creative: Perfect.
Jacob Greenberg: So this is what it would look like once you sign up Inside Nickel. Have you created an account yet or you wanted to do the demo before?
Always Creative: I haven't yet. But I can't. Cool.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, I'll walk you through this. I'm going to quickly highlight actually the pricing plans. Just so upfront and transparent, you have it in your back pocket. As we move through this demo, Nickel Core is free to sign up. So after this demo you're able to just go create your account, sign up, link your bank account, link your QuickBooks. I'll show you how to do all of that. It's $0 a month. The only thing that is worth noting, especially in your case, is there is a twenty five thousand dollar limit per individual transaction. That limit is gone when you go on the nickel plus plan, which is 35amonth. And if you pay for a year up front, if you pay on a monthly basis, it's 45amonth. Both those, you could have a 14 day free trial.
Always Creative: Cool.
Jacob Greenberg: The one other thing with Nickel plus is you're going to get one day quicker turnaround time. So two day CH and next day for credit card. You also get to do things like schedule payments in advance, do remote check deposits, recurring payments, et cetera. So a couple more features with the plus plan. I encourage you to go to the pricing page here and check it out at your leisure and make sure you pick the right one. If you choose Core and you get started with Core, you can always upgrade on your own from within Nickel. So before I dive too much into the features, I'm going to quickly go to Account settings here. This is the first tab you want to go to after you link your bank account and get set up with Nickel, you're going to update your logo and your branding so you'll have a banner and a logo and you'll be able to customize this so that you have a Nickel pay URL. I'll show you what that means in a second. Just a quick overview here. You're able to add as many members as you want on the Nickel plus plan. On the Nickel Core you could add two other members besides yourself and you could give them different permissions. If you do want to upgrade, you just go to Plans under Settings and you could change it at any time.
Always Creative: Cool.
Jacob Greenberg: And then the first other thing you're going to do is sync your QuickBooks. So that's going to be on the Integrations tab after Account settings. Just to be forewarned, depending on how much data you have in your QuickBooks, the sync itself might take up to like six or seven minutes. I've the most ever seen is seven.
Always Creative: That's 20 years of data. So it'll be so it'll probably up.
Jacob Greenberg: To seven or 10 minutes after that first sync though. Every transaction you have is a one to one automatic instantaneous push.
Always Creative: Cool.
Jacob Greenberg: The the first like time consuming integration step is the initial link. You'll click the chart of accounts you want to look over. After that everything's one to one.
Always Creative: Okay. Because this is just configuring your APIs and then it exactly talks you to gotcha. Great.
Jacob Greenberg: Took care of all the integration stuff. Account settings I will. Oh one thing to highlight is our help center here is put a lot of work into this. So there'll be platform demo videos here which is going to be like high level 1 minute videos of the most basic things you're going to want to check out. If you have any questions, I recommend going to this first, then after that we do have like your setup guide for new to nickel. If you have any frequently asked questions you want to answer, this is a great spot to go to.
Always Creative: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: You can also do live chats with us through this bot. If you need more technical support in the future we have a really, really quick response time. It's typically under 24 hours for really high technical support. For little things it's within a four or five hour and you can email us@supportetneko.com okay, so the first page is your summary. It's a high level overview of your recent transactions. The Transactions tab is where you're going to see a full chart of everything going on within your account. You can organize it by receivables or payables, any refunds that you want to process, any returns or any chargebacks. Chargebacks are pretty rare on nickel because we have the heightened security measures and because we're involved in that process. So on the transaction side you're going to be able to see all the all the basic information like date, amount, what account is coming from and going to. The purpose. Do you guys use invoice numbers or purpose statements for your invoices?
Always Creative: Invoice numbers.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, so this will all be an invoice numbers. Once you sync with QuickBooks it's going to auto populate with the corresponding QuickBooks number. For invoice you'll see the status of that process. You can add any extra notes you want to on this line item level you can also download the CSV if you want. For you guys, you probably won't use that feature that often since you're going to be pushing back and forth with.
Always Creative: QuickBooks.
Jacob Greenberg: For your invoicing, you're going to be living out of the Get Paid tab, you'll see once I click on the Get Paid tab on the left hand navigation menu, you're going to have both two sections, Invoices and Customers. Once you sync with QuickBooks, this will be populated. If you want, you could generate your invoices from Nickel and add new customers from Nickel and it will populate in QuickBooks. And if you want to continue to go through the same process, which a lot of our customers do, of generating the invoices from QuickBooks, it will sync into Nickel and then all you need to do is come. You'll see beyond the top line here and instead of this saying sent on 1003, it will say Send Invoice and you just click the button and it will send. You can also create Multiple invoices from QuickBooks. Select all of the invoices that are on Sent you. You can even filter for unsent invoices, select them all and send them all at the same time.
Always Creative: Wow. Okay. That's awesome. Can you do me a favor? Can you show me what your invoices look like?
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, for sure. So typically what I do is I just walk through creating an invoice inside Nickel. I'll create one customized for you and then I'll show you what else.
Always Creative: Love it. Got it.
Jacob Greenberg: The one thing you're not going to see here is because this demo account isn't linked to QuickBooks, you want all the unique line item stuff. But just so you know, if you do create an invoice within Nickel, all of the line items and features that you've embedded your QuickBooks will populate during the Create Invoice tab inside Nickel as well. So you have the ability to do it from nickel or from QuickBooks. So I'm just going to create a new customer here. I'm going to put my email address so that you'll see what it looks like when it's received. Again, right here will be all that line item information coming from QuickBooks. The invoice number will automatically populate for you. Going to do an invoice amount you could set one time in recurring. You'll just pick the cadence on a monthly, weekly, quarterly, annual basis and it'll show you a payment preview. Let's just do one time. For now, you put any notes for customers and a feature that some people really use a lot here is the upload documents feature.
Always Creative: So.
Jacob Greenberg: So once you create a QuickBooks invoice, that PDF line item breakdown will automatically be attached to the Nickel invoice. You could also upload anything else. So I just uploaded a sample invoice. If you have photos of the project, if you guys do NET terms agreements for example, you could upload all of that right here. And it really just consolidates the communication that you have with the customer. So all they need to do is open up the single invoice associated with that job. All the files that you want to coordinate and communicate with them will be downloadable from that one invoice and with that portal. Okay, the final thing here is on the advanced settings you're able to enable the customer to edit the payment amount. So this is if you did want to take a deposit, if you have a ten thousand dollar job, it's a two thousand dollar deposit. You could send the single invoice and they could pay 2,000 or if they wanted to pay half of the 10,000 in credit card and half and ach they have the ability to do that.
Always Creative: Got it. Okay, that's nice.
Jacob Greenberg: I just click create and then invoice.
Always Creative: That's actually really good because I could say like for example, someone's on the, on the fence. I'll say here's what I'm willing to do. I'm willing to do the first half via ach. Now the second half you can put on a credit card and I'll cover the fees. Yep. And then it allows it to go, okay, I can get a 0% interest card and pay this off at my leisure. Yep. So cool. That's badass. I like that.
Jacob Greenberg: So I'll walk you through this. Two things here really quick is you're able to send the payment link which I'll do and I'll show you what it looks like. If you have a customer card information you're able to either schedule the charge for a certain date or just charge the customer right away and you could add this information on your own. Here we have a really sleek way of requesting the customer to give you authorization as well to do car charges. So some of our users have started to onboard new customers by sending them this link where they go through a two second form where they enter enter their bank information and accept three terms and conditions and then they're able to be auto charged. For now I'm just going to send this link. It can be sent via text message or email or both. And you'll always be able to come into this invoice and copy that link if you need to find it again.
Always Creative: Oh man, this is so great because we're going to start doing mandatory like monthly fees for website Maintenance and I can just literally set them up and run it.
Jacob Greenberg: There you go.
Always Creative: Okay. Yeah. Awesome.
Jacob Greenberg: That will be on the recurring charges feature. Just a heads up, my wi fi has been a little spotty today.
Always Creative: Don't worry about it.
Jacob Greenberg: Let's see if this email invoice comes in. Yep, here it goes.
Always Creative: Great.
Jacob Greenberg: So in my demo account, the dummy company that we created is called Degr Distribution. So that's why you'll see this here for you. When the email goes out, it'll say Always Creative. And the invoice number, it'll have your logo here and when you click on this button actually will redirect to your website, which is pretty nice.
Always Creative: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: It'll have a high level overview. You have a new payment request. Always Creative requested a payment. Here's the amount, due date, basic information and any attachments will be directly here in the email as well. When you go to click Pay now, this page will pop up. All the PDF invoices or any documents you have will be here. When clicked, they'll download.
Always Creative: So this is, this is the, the most important feature for me because it's a brand experience. So what you're saying is I could take and make a custom branded invoice PDF for them to look at here and then it just ignores the one that they would see in QuickBooks because it doesn't send it to them in the first place. So that ugly invoice is gone and.
Jacob Greenberg: Now 100%, this will be your right here. And this is the go ahead.
Always Creative: Sorry, sorry.
Jacob Greenberg: No, no, go for it.
Always Creative: Because. So that file right there is the one you uploaded previously as a PDF.
Jacob Greenberg: So what happened is the line item invoice will auto attach from QuickBooks just the line item PDF. You could keep that or remove it before you send it out. Any documents that you want, you can upload it here. So if you wanted to do your own custom PDF with better branding, you can, you could attach that on your own.
Always Creative: Okay, got it.
Jacob Greenberg: Beneath the payment amount here, if you've had previous transactions with this individual, they'll be able to click and see all of their previous invoices as well. So it's all stored within this portal for that one customer.
Always Creative: Cool.
Jacob Greenberg: Again, any notes will go here. You'll see that you're able to change the payment amount just like that. And once it's paid, you'll be able to see the amount and how much has been paid. So if they've only paid 5,000, you'll see the 5,000. 5,000. Once it has been paid It'll move into the completed section and you'll see all of the paid invoices. Now from here, the experience for the customer is essentially giving them the option to pay however they want. And the goal of nickel is to be able to give your customers the optionality to pay however they prefer without it creating any fees on your end and without it creating any lag or complaints on your end.
Always Creative: So great.
Jacob Greenberg: So what they'll do here is you'll see they could pay by card. There's a 2.99 fee associated with paying by card should they elect to make that payment. In that method I'm going to change this back to 10,000. Or they could pay by bank and they'll see that there's no fees associated with it. So we find a quarter of the time, a fifth to a quarter of the time. Customers of nickel users prefer to pay by card because of the cash flow advantage. Most businesses have 2 to 3% rewards or cash back programs anyway. So they're just cashing in on that extra 15 to 30 days that they have the ability to pay off that payment.
Always Creative: Yep. I, I really just quick feedback which you already kind of know. I think the incredible part is that I'm saying, look, we just want to be easy to work with. Whatever works better for you. We don't make it, we're not adding it to the invoice. It doesn't become some nonsense. I have to track for ins and outs on an invoice. It's like percentage based and do I tax it or non taxable. It just becomes such an annoying. Yeah, like the fact that it's like whatever makes it easier. Please just pay us.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, that's the whole, that's the whole thought process here. So I'm happy that it's resonating with you guys and that 2.99 fee, we add it should they elect to pay it. It's not added to your invoices or to your docu, to your documents and your QuickBooks for tax purposes. It's added on the customer side. You don't have to see it reflected in your books. It's a very clean process.
Always Creative: Amazing. Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: And so you'll reduce all of your fees here.
Always Creative: Dude, I'm sold.
Jacob Greenberg: It's straightforward, it's very simple and basic. And we wanted to make payments has like become really complex. Especially in the bill world industry people are accepting cards one way. Ach, one way, checks one way, wires one way. Sending out invoices in two or three different platforms have six or Seven different tools and it gets messy. So we just wanted to make it hyper simple and that's we have a little bit more time. But this is the nuts and bolts of ar. I'm going to show you one quick little Easter egg. I'm not sure if this is actually going to apply to you on the AR side and then I'll pop into the build pay side and show you a little bit of features there as well.
Always Creative: Cool, cool.
Jacob Greenberg: This payments portal link is going to be. You're automatically going to have access to this, whether any of the pro plan or the core plan. And this is essentially an embeddable hyperlink into your website for just generic payments. If people want to make those. Not sure if it's going to apply to you guys as much. It'll be your brand, your logo, return to your website. You could customize this form and you can just have a make a payment section on your website where people can enter the amount that they're going to pay, the reason for payment, and then choose to pay via credit card or choose to pay via achievement. It's very straightforward.
Always Creative: That's actually great because we're going to have an E commerce store.
Jacob Greenberg: Oh, awesome.
Always Creative: So that might like if we for example, we make a bunch of merch and if somebody's like, hey, I'd like to buy that here, just I don't have to create an invoice, just send me money through this thing. Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: And we'll send it to you.
Always Creative: Yep, I'll see, you know. Yeah, cool.
Jacob Greenberg: Perfect. So that's a little Easter egg on ap. If you do want to do recurring invoices, when you click on recurring invoices on that tab, we have a ton. But this example of your way to be able to navigate your recurring invoices, you could search by customer, make it easy to see all the recurring invoices, and you can click into any invoice, whether recurring regular, to edit it or to see the details of it. And to create a recurring invoice, you can do it the same way that I showed you before or just to create it from here. And you'll make a recurring. Now on the bill pay side, also very, very simple and very similar to ar, you can do recurring bills as well. If you want to pay things like rent or utilities, you can create new bills for individual vendors. And if you wanted to play pay employees, you would add them as a vendor as well. That's how some of our customers currently do it.
Always Creative: So if I wanted to send owner draws via ACH Like I can do that. Yeah. Vers or versus Zel. Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, absolutely.
Always Creative: Cool.
Jacob Greenberg: You'll see here, some of these have the QuickBooks icon next to it. That means that these from QuickBooks. So your entire nickel account will pretty much just be fully QuickBooks icons.
Always Creative: Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: And it's that straightforward. You have a high level overview of your vendors, how much you've totaled, your spend with them, the balance with them, the active bills you have currently with them. You can easily create a bill for each vendor if you want from the vendor page page. And then there's this approval section where you can have somebody else in your company sign in and have their own login, manage payments, schedule payments in advance, etc. Etc. And if you want to put an approval or denial feature in there for a manager to make sure that they're reviewing it, approving payments before they go out, you can make that customization here and you could build certain workflows as well. And that's bill pay in a nutshell.
Always Creative: Cool. Yep.
Jacob Greenberg: Very, very straightforward.
Always Creative: Okay, well this is what I was, what I was hoping for. So I love, I'm, I'm so excited about the ability. Granted it's going to make extra work for me, but to send a $25,000 invoice, it looks like crap from QuickBooks versus you. I create a template to design it looks on brand that's just also just a better experience for the customer. So it's just, it's kind of a really a no brainer for me.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, it shouldn't create extra work as the plan with the QuickBooks integration and some of the navigation we gave to Nickel is a little bit more seamless than QuickBooks but it's a one step more to send out the invoice. But yeah, probably worth a couple thousand dollars a month.
Always Creative: Oh yeah, I mean it's, it's definitely worth the feature. I mean again, it's just to make it fully stylistically branded. And for me, you know, I almost want to recommend every client do this now and say, hey, here's your invoice templates. You can make that on brand receipts and invoices are often like the most missed opportunity for brands. So do that.
Jacob Greenberg: If you do want to make a recommendation or referral, do it there. Come in here, click the referral button, copy this. What I can do is I could send you an email with your referral link to create your account and the best way to ensure that you're going to be paid out your referral bonus because it's $250 for each company that signs up is I'll create a template for you that you could share in an email and CC me so they can have the link. They'll log in, it'll be tracked to your account, and I will have visibility once they create the account to make sure that everything's going to be passed over to you.
Always Creative: Okay. Yeah. Well, this is all. This is great, man. I really appreciate it. So what I'll do then is always get started. Sign up, set it up, and if I run into questions, I'll. I'll reach out. But, yeah, I'll be doing this within. Got it as fast I can. The only questions I'm going to have is, okay, how do I turn off payments? The quickbook side to make sure there's no fees being processed there.
Jacob Greenberg: But this year, you're sending out the payments from nickel, and that should take care of it.
Always Creative: Okay, cool. Oh, yeah. Because it's there. Can't charge on something not getting paid on, so. Yep. Okay. Well, dude, thank you so much. This is really helpful. I'm really happy I found y'. All. Now, literally within the next 24 hours, we'll be setting this up and saving a ton of money every month.
Jacob Greenberg: If you have any questions, if you need any support, please don't hesitate to reach out to me directly. I'm happy to help.
