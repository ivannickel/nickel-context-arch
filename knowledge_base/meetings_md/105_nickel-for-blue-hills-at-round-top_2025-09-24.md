Christian Sheerer: Sense like it was remembering for. Because I. I went and spoke with Najeer and he. His guess is that QuickBooks is just remembering. Antique QuickBooks. Yeah, the one to link up. So he just. He disconnected that. So we could just link that one up again and we could go one by one by one. And we might have to open incognito window to do it. Or we might just have to hit a couple refreshes and it should give that drop down when you first did it. Of the three different. Because it's the same. Is it the same QuickBooks login? Like, no password.
Stephanie Disney: It's not. The original roundtop has a different. Has like its own. And then Blue Hills and BH2 are the same.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, cool. So then there will be a drop down that looks sort of like this. Sort of like this. For the. For the one with two.
Stephanie Disney: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: Good.
Stephanie Disney: Okay. So I just linked blue holes at round top. So then.
Christian Sheerer: Cool. Do you want to share for me, I mean. Yeah, just so I'm following along.
Stephanie Disney: Let me see.
Catherine Sharp: And I don't know if it'll help you, Stephanie, when you're practicing, but I have started entering some winter invoices for Blue Hills. So if you need some invoices to try to sync, there are some in there.
Christian Sheerer: They should come automatically.
Stephanie Disney: Okay.
Catherine Sharp: Do you, like, put a date or something? Because obviously we wouldn't. I don't know if we would want outstanding invoices to go in there. Or maybe we would. I don't know.
Christian Sheerer: It'll have. It'll pull in the open ones.
Catherine Sharp: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. The previous closed reconciled ones will just stay closed.
Stephanie Disney: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: They won't come in because we're like, hey, you already already paid. Right?
Stephanie Disney: Right. So, okay, so then if this one is linked to a different login, is that what pops up?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, let's see.
Stephanie Disney: So this same one pops up.
Christian Sheerer: Okay. Yeah, try. Let's try. So did you do the ones with the two already? Sorry? With it.
Stephanie Disney: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, cool. So let's try to. Let's do it in an incognito window or. Yeah, or that. Or that. Let's try that first. Beautiful.
Stephanie Disney: Okay, that was. That was much easier fix.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, cool.
Stephanie Disney: I was anticipating.
Christian Sheerer: Well.
Stephanie Disney: And I just wasn't sure, like, like now that you explained what was happening. That totally makes sense. I just wasn't sure, like, what exactly was going on.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, let's just make sure that they. They're. They're pulling and you want to go to like, transactions or something or. Sorry, get paid. Okay. On the left. This is for these are your second.
Najeer Ahmed: And then.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. Pick the right chart of accounts for this one. You're in, you're in original round tap nt.
Stephanie Disney: So.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, you're gonna have to hit set up payments right there in the middle.
Stephanie Disney: Oh, okay.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, cool. If you want to add your logo, I mean, I might recommend doing that now.
Stephanie Disney: Do it now.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. Nice. Cool. So yeah, these are in.
Stephanie Disney: Great. So this is just everything open.
Christian Sheerer: Mm.
Catherine Sharp: So once it's in, you would hit request payment and it would send them an email. And, and then once it's paid, how does the money get transferred to our account into QuickBooks? How does that work?
Christian Sheerer: So it'll, it'll hit your account like it'll be. If they're paying you by card, it'll be a one business day turnaround.
Catherine Sharp: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: And deposit it. You guys have put your bank account information in already. If it's a ACH2 business day turnaround and so you'll get a notification that it's been initiated and then you'll get a notification that it's been processed. They will get the same one as well. So like initiated means they, you know, paid it. Right. I think the language we use actually is like paid is initiated and processed is fully, you know, cleared, finalized or whatever. And then when that's done, it'll get moved into completed on nickel and paid in QuickBooks.
Catherine Sharp: Okay. I'll be interested to see how it interfaces on the QuickBooks side. Like, I mean, I guess we'll, we can just kind of wait and see. But I'm wondering, usually when we get a payment, we have to kind of go into the customer on quickbook, but we get notified that some. Something was paid by ACH and then we go into the customer and actually click that the payment is there and match it to the deposit. So I'm assuming it's the same sort.
Christian Sheerer: Of interface or you won't even have to click. You'll just. It'll be, it'll be matched as, as paid.
Catherine Sharp: I guess it would be because you, the invoice, it knows what invoice to match it to because it gets. Okay, that's, that's cool.
Christian Sheerer: Mm, that's cool. And yeah, and you, what you could also do is if you go to the top left there in the invoices where it's like right next to invoice date. If you click that little box, it'll, it'll click all the ones that are displayed in that. The box above it. Right, right there. Yeah. So you could do it all at once if you wanted. But it'll still be each individual link. So if you want to hit send payments request, it won't send right, right away you'll have to do one more check through. You know, you can just. They got the right emails there. And then if you hit send requests, it'll send them all and you can make the view more than 10 if you want. If you're going to do all 30 or if you're going to add a different recipient for each of them and.
Stephanie Disney: Then you can, you can have it like send us a text also.
Christian Sheerer: Exactly, exactly.
Catherine Sharp: So I guess Stephanie, from our end it's probably really important that all the emails are in each customer profile, which I think most of them are, but occasionally I'll pull up one that's not there. So I guess we, we really need to make sure those are there and they're accurate.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, correct. And you'll get a, you'll get a notification if you have one that's not, that bounces back. I think it should be a notification, but you'll get a big red box. Like it'll be red. If I was on that screen that Stephanie was just on and they didn't have one uploaded or you didn't put their email in on when you were making that customer profile on QuickBooks. Okay, so then that's like a good two step, like kind of like review, like, hey, I'll check all of them. And then, oh, I need actually an email for Betsy for example.
Catherine Sharp: Gotcha.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. And then the customer, if you go to the customers tab too, it's pulling all the customer information from them as well.
Catherine Sharp: I see. Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: So you could do the same things in both of the different views. Like if I, you know, if Tony's giving me a hard time, I can send him an invoice direct to him and I can create one for him in nickel. But I think the way that you guys have it set up now is the way that I would recommend. You're kind of corralling everything into your ERP and then you using Nicol to send out those payment links and it'll get reconciled once they're paid out there.
Catherine Sharp: It looks very user friendly.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, that's. We sort of want all the hard stuff to be happening under the hood, you know, you guys, I mean, if.
Catherine Sharp: I didn't know better, I would think I might be looking at a QuickBooks screen. Just the way it's set up and everything, it, it looks pretty user friendly.
Christian Sheerer: It's funny, like software is pretty much, it's changing a lot Actually with the whole AI stuff. But software pretty much is just like a series of spreadsheets, like, over and over and over and stacked up on top of each other. And so that's why Microsoft is so successful is because they pretty much invented Excel and so like, can do all those things. That's like father of all software. Comes from modern software. Cool. But yeah, you know, you try to. You try to keep it as. I feel like a spreadsheet is like a good little view of everything. I don't like it when it gets into the. Into the real world, though. I always make a joke when I'm walking around Manhattan that the buildings even look like spreadsheets.
Catherine Sharp: That's funny. Is that where you're. Do you live in Manhattan or.
Christian Sheerer: We're in. I live in Brooklyn, but, you know, right across. Right across the river.
Catherine Sharp: Exactly.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. And. Yeah. Let's see if these one. Okay. Yeah. So these are different, right? I don't. I'm not seeing Betsy. I see Heather and Cool.
Catherine Sharp: And Stephanie. These all have. I just used October 15th for the winter invoice date.
Stephanie Disney: Yeah.
Catherine Sharp: Is that okay or.
Stephanie Disney: Yes, but I would probably. I don't know if I would do it based on last winter because a lot of these people probably, like, won't. Some people won't be. But that. I mean.
Catherine Sharp: Right. They won't be coming back, you mean, or.
Stephanie Disney: Yeah. So, like, is that okay? Like, as far as. Okay if we Delete something in QuickBooks, does it delete in nickel also?
Christian Sheerer: Okay.
Catherine Sharp: So do you already know who's coming back for winter? Stephanie?
Stephanie Disney: Not. Not official.
Catherine Sharp: Yeah. 80%. Yeah.
Stephanie Disney: I could work on. I'll add it to my list to work on that rent roll.
Christian Sheerer: It.
Catherine Sharp: Which is already set up. I have set up the 2026 rent roll and so it's there. So if you want to go through and cross out anybody. And I'll delete them in QuickBooks.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. Great. So. Okay.
Catherine Sharp: Perfect.
Christian Sheerer: Okay.
Stephanie Disney: And then I might have to go back and download this logo. I'm not sure where it is.
Najeer Ahmed: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: You can always change it or upload it in the. In the settings.
Stephanie Disney: Yeah, I'll come back and do it because I'm not sure where it is and I'm someone. Okay, wait.
Christian Sheerer: That.
Stephanie Disney: These are. This is not. This is original round top.
Catherine Sharp: Yeah. That's not the right.
Christian Sheerer: You had two BH2 charts of accounts is.
Stephanie Disney: Yeah, but this isn't either of those.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. Go to integrations.
Stephanie Disney: It pulled up the right.
Christian Sheerer: Right. Char. But this is Click sync in the top. Right. Weird. This is the. This is the same. This is the same as the antique round top. Yeah.
Catherine Sharp: You know, I wonder if it has something to do with Stephanie. Like, when I log into QuickBooks for Blue Hills and Big Red Barn, they're kind of on the same profile, and I have to. Actually, once I'm in Intuit, I have to go up to the company files. It's like, there are two company files in that one Intuit profile, if that makes sense. And I have to go up and pick which company I'm working for. So I wonder if that's why it's pulling from the wrong.
Stephanie Disney: I don't know.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, let's go to. Go to Account Settings and Integrations again, and then change. And we need it to be BH2. Okay, let's. Let's revoke and then do it again. I'll just hit Technical issues. Yeah.
Najeer Ahmed: Link.
Christian Sheerer: Okay. Here, here. Yeah, yeah. This one. Let's try. Okay. So the other two are linked correctly, right?
Stephanie Disney: Yes.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, let's. Let's. Can you make an incognito window? I think it's just storing stuff in the cache, which is.
Stephanie Disney: Okay, how do I make an incognito window?
Christian Sheerer: Hit. Hit. You're. You're on a Mac, right? Hit Command Shift.
Stephanie Disney: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: And. And then log in. I'll log into Nickel. You'll remember the password, right?
Stephanie Disney: I have it saved, but.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah.
Stephanie Disney: Oh, but will it not know it if it.
Christian Sheerer: Maybe, Maybe. Maybe it will, actually. Oh, nice. Okay, cool.
Najeer Ahmed: And then.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. VH2. And then account settings integrations. Oh, hey, y'. All. Oh, she got to join. Okay, cool. Hey, it.
Stephanie Disney: It's still doing it.
Christian Sheerer: This is the round top one. Still. What would. What would be the names of, like. Can you give me just two names of customers on the BH2?
Stephanie Disney: Yeah, I'm trying to think of who has open invoices.
Catherine Sharp: I can. Hold on. Let me see. I might have something pulled up. Let me look. Looking at the rent roll. Trae Market has an open invoice. God, they may be the only ones.
Christian Sheerer: That's.
Catherine Sharp: That's a way I'm looking at. Yeah, I think Tray Market's the only one with the open invoice that I see on the rent roll.
Stephanie Disney: I think they've actually paid, though.
Catherine Sharp: Oh, okay. Let me. Let me look at the QuickBooks and see what's. What's outstanding for.
Christian Sheerer: I'm gonna have. Yeah, maybe. Yeah. Refreshing with intuitive work. But I'm gonna have ninth year take a look, because we went through his suggestions of incognit, and he's going to hop in with us and see if Brainstorm would work.
Stephanie Disney: Are you trying to add the link to an open invoice? Is that what the dilemma is right now?
Christian Sheerer: It's just syncing. Hannah, dear. It's just syncing BH2. When we click BH2, it's syncing to the original antique round top.
Stephanie Disney: Okay. So Marie Merrill.
Christian Sheerer: I'll just note Marie and Smoke Daddies.
Stephanie Disney: Smoke daddies.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. Good.
Stephanie Disney: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: So Najeer, the other one's linked. It was just like a cache or whatever issue. But now the final One we're doing, BH2 LLC is linking to antique. Sorry, Round top.
Stephanie Disney: Original Round top.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, yeah.
Najeer Ahmed: Is there a. Do you still get the chance to see the drop down, or is it just like automatically going straight in?
Stephanie Disney: We know we got it to where it had the dropdown and we selected the correct company and then we even selected the correct, you know, account bank account. But then it just populates with the other company's invoices.
Najeer Ahmed: Let me take a look here. And this is for BH2, where this is the incorrect connection.
Christian Sheerer: Right.
Najeer Ahmed: Okay. I think the best thing to do right now would be. So I need to go in and clean this up a bit because we have the wrong invoices now imported in. What we should do is let's disconnect the QuickBooks account for BH2 because it's the wrong one. And then I'm going to remove all these invoices and customers and basically reset, refresh this account. And then it should. I think if we open a new incognito window like beyond this one, it should work then. So I think the same issue is happening where there's some sort of cached QuickBooks account thing, and it's looking the wrong account. But let me go ahead and work on clearing out this account before you guys do that. And so the other accounts were. You were able to connect those just fine, right?
Stephanie Disney: Yes.
Najeer Ahmed: And when you guys log into the QuickBooks accounts, these are under your own accounting kind of umbrella. QuickBooks account.
Christian Sheerer: Right there. Two of them are. And then one of them is. Yeah, Stephanie, you can answer better than me. Sorry.
Stephanie Disney: Oh, no, it's fine. Yeah, Two. Two are under one login and one is under a different login.
Najeer Ahmed: I see. Which. Which two are under the same login?
Stephanie Disney: So Blue Hills at Round Top and Blue Hills two are under the same login.
Najeer Ahmed: Okay. And so this is the one that we're having the issue with. Right. The Blue Hills 2 is the one.
Stephanie Disney: We'Re having the issue with.
Najeer Ahmed: Right. And it tried to connect to Blue Hills Round Top. Is that right?
Stephanie Disney: No. So it actually is connecting to original Round Top, which is the other log.
Najeer Ahmed: The other login. Really?
Christian Sheerer: Oh, yes.
Najeer Ahmed: Yeah. So that's got to be some sort of QuickBooks caching issue, I think, because those are definitely two different logins.
Christian Sheerer: So.
Najeer Ahmed: So yeah, I'm going to go reset this account. I think what will happen is it'll clear out all the invoices and customers and I'll give you the green light, Christian, after that and then just try to reconnect again with a completely fresh, kind of like window fresh incognito. Clear the cache, Christian. Well, let's just try it with the incognito because it sounds like this is a weird QuickBooks login cache thing that's happening here. It might be. Also because we're trying to log into two different QuickBooks accounts. Usually when an accounting client comes in, they have all their clients under the same login. So there just might be an issue here because there is like these two different logins right now.
Stephanie Disney: Would it be easier if I just changed it so they're all under the same login?
Najeer Ahmed: It might. But let's, let's, let's try to do this thing first before we make it even more complicated potentially. So I'm going to go ahead and do that. I'm going to jump off while I do that and I'll give you the green light, Christian.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, cool.
Najeer Ahmed: When it's ready.
Christian Sheerer: Okay.
Najeer Ahmed: Thanks guys. Sorry about this.
Stephanie Disney: Thank you.
Christian Sheerer: Cool. Yeah, well, that's getting sorted. Anything else that was like top of mind. You had questions about either Jenny or Kathy. Stephanie. Of course.
Catherine Sharp: I don't, not offhand. May have some when we really start working with it, but it looks pretty, pretty user friendly.
Christian Sheerer: Cool. And so just so I have a. I'm clear the. So the. Okay, so Blue Hills 2 and Blue Hills at Round Top. And those seem to be. Oh, so the original Round Top. Those are a little bit earlier in terms of your guys's like collections flow.
Stephanie Disney: Oh, like timing.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, yeah.
Stephanie Disney: I think there's just more open invoices.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, cool.
Stephanie Disney: For them, they kind of will all. They generally all collect around the same time. It just kind of dates vary a little bit.
Christian Sheerer: Cool. Yeah, Yeah. I was just, I was just making note of the different. Like the ones that are in September and then on the other one it was like all.
Catherine Sharp: October. Yeah, those are, those are new. They're different shows.
Christian Sheerer: Okay.
Stephanie Disney: Like new.
Catherine Sharp: Some, some are outstanding for the fall show. And. And the October ones are all for the winter.
Christian Sheerer: Show it.
Stephanie Disney: Okay, so then this is where we would add bank account info.
Christian Sheerer: Mm. Yeah. So the one that you want to get your stuff paid into or. Yeah, bill pay payout of. Yeah, and that, that'll. That'll just open up like a plaid verification, which should be approved quick as well.
Stephanie Disney: Yeah. And then as far as setting up the bill pay, like, if we don't currently do that much of that on QuickBooks, is it like a pretty easy set up for what does that look like as far as, like, if we had a new vendor that we were going to pay via ach.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. You could just pick it up in the top. Right. New vendor.
Stephanie Disney: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: You can send them a request to put their information or if you already have it.
Stephanie Disney: Okay, perfect.
Christian Sheerer: Then they'll get a nice email like, hey, they want to pay you Nadir. Just let me know that it should be. It should be good to try again for ph2.
Stephanie Disney: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: Let's hope we see smoke daddies again.
Stephanie Disney: So should I sign out over here? Is that.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, honestly, that might be smart.
Stephanie Disney: Did we get our own sign in or do we share sign ins? We get our own. Right, you get your own. I. I need to invite y'.
Christian Sheerer: All.
Stephanie Disney: I just hadn't yet because I hadn't gotten everything. No worries. Set up. But today I should be able to do that.
Christian Sheerer: Wow. Yay. Okay. I'm glad. I would have been like, and there's smoke and they're smoke daddy. That's the most important one. Are they good? Are you at it?
Stephanie Disney: Yeah, it's great. I mean, I, you know, don't know if he's ever gonna pay us, but. Yeah, I'm in the same terrible with. With him. Yeah. Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: Then I mean, you just use it as like. Yeah, like a. It's a brisket credit. You don't have to pay us, but we can come get some food for free.
Stephanie Disney: It's a lot of brisket. Okay, great.
Christian Sheerer: Okay. Yeah. I mean, that's sort of what I was getting at in terms. I want to make sure everything was good. But that's what I was getting at in terms of like the, like which ones get sent out earlier just so I can keep an eye on it. And if we want to set another check in, can absolutely do that. Oh, Najeer, it worked. We got smoke daddies in here now.
Najeer Ahmed: Okay, great. Sounds good. All right, take care, guys.
Stephanie Disney: Thank you.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, I just, I would. And that one, I mean, I think everything will sort of be gravy train from now on. But if we wanted to set a check in after those first couple of transactions goes through, that's where I was asking so that you know, Kathy, if you have questions or Jenny, you have questions about, you know, any. Any things that we already discussed but like, you know, you just want a refresher on, we can do that.
Catherine Sharp: Sounds good.
Stephanie Disney: Yeah, maybe.
Catherine Sharp: Maybe we just play with it and decide if we need another meeting or.
Stephanie Disney: Yeah, cool.
Catherine Sharp: Or when we might need it.
Stephanie Disney: Yeah. Or Jenny, like when you and I are both in round top next week or the week after.
Christian Sheerer: Okay.
Stephanie Disney: Yeah, let us play with it and then we'll email you. I. Since we're all kind of like traveling and getting to the show and stuff next week that we can look at our schedules and see when my work.
Christian Sheerer: All right. Yeah, let's do it. And I'll. I'll be, I'll be perusing and so yeah, you know, you'll get notifications when things get paid and like sent to you and then actually processed and actually received by you guys. So two business day on ach. If they're paying by a card, it's a one day turnaround. So yeah, if you send out a request, just expect it in those time frames.
Stephanie Disney: Okay, perfect.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. And you guys are good to go? Yeah, just come go in and hit request and they'll be able to get sent out to each of them.
Stephanie Disney: Great. Well, thank you so much.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, no problem. I'm glad. I mean, thank you. I'm glad we made the time so that we could like troubleshoot these weird things and so awesome. Yeah, I'm glad we got everything set up and thank you for your guys patience and yeah, that should be good to go and I'm excited to hear how it goes and also when the, when the show happens. I'm excited to hear about that too.
Stephanie Disney: Yeah, for sure. Okay, great. Well, thank you.
Catherine Sharp: Thank you.
Stephanie Disney: Bye, Christian.
Christian Sheerer: Bye. Bye. It.
