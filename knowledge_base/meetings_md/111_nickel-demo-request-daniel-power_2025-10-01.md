krystinaathas: Sam, it. Hi.
Christian Sheerer: Hey.
DP: How's it going?
krystinaathas: Can you hear me? Good. How are you? Yeah, I. I realized. I came in the office and realized that my, like, office computer doesn't have Zoom on it, but luckily brought my computer. Sorry about that. No, it's okay. And I don't think Daniel knew that it was on Zoom. Oh, I just sent him a message. Cool. What do you think?
Christian Sheerer: You think we're just chatting over the phone? We could do that.
krystinaathas: I was like, I don't know if they're going to call me or not, but I think. Hold on. He forwarded it to me a minute ago, so he should be coming soon.
Christian Sheerer: Just call in too. That. That may be only important if one of you can see me and if I share my screen. If we go through the platform.
krystinaathas: Yeah, I know he. Has he done. He should be on. I bet if he comes on in a minute.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, cool.
krystinaathas: I just. Just texted himself. He should be on.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, I was taking a look around the site. I'm excited. This is going to be fun. Drama pen.
krystinaathas: I'm gonna move myself.
Christian Sheerer: Actually, do you guys know Jacob? Jacob mentioned that he was familiar with y'. All. Jacob?
krystinaathas: Jacob.
Christian Sheerer: I mean, I'm. I realize Jacob is a common name.
krystinaathas: Jacob who?
Christian Sheerer: Greenberg.
krystinaathas: Do we know Jacob Greenberg? That's not familiar.
Christian Sheerer: No, his dad's name is Phil. His dad's a cool photographer. He was like, oh, I know Powerhouse. Like, blah, blah, blah.
krystinaathas: I will say, if he knows Powerhouse, Bookst also happens to be. Do you live in New York?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, we're. We are in. We're in Prospect Heights right now.
krystinaathas: You are where?
Christian Sheerer: We're.
krystinaathas: It's so weird.
Christian Sheerer: We're in, like, a co. Working space, but we're moving to Dumbo in our own office in about a month.
krystinaathas: Oh. I live at 7th and Flatbush, so I live just over.
Christian Sheerer: Oh, crazy.
krystinaathas: Like, technically Park Slope, but, like, right. Flatbush apparently is like the divide dividing factor of prospectites in Park Slope, which I didn't know until recently. And our office is an industry city.
Christian Sheerer: Oh.
krystinaathas: So I'm an industry city right now. And Daniel also lives in Park Slope.
Christian Sheerer: Cool. Yeah. Yeah. Small world. I mean. Yeah, it's not like a. It's not like, super apparent. I don't even think we even put it on the site. We deal with a lot of people from all over the country, but, like, you know, the business is geared towards making payments. Simple for. It's kind of got our start for, like, industrial businesses. Right. So, like, people who are manufacturing parts or selling steel or selling nickel and so, like, I guess maybe we don't want to, you know, portray ourselves as the Brooklynites, you know, who are understanding of what happens in Kansas or Illinois or something like that.
krystinaathas: So a lot of your clients are New York City based?
Christian Sheerer: No, I mean, there are some, but a lot of them are. A lot of them are in the middle of the country. Yeah.
DP: Or all over.
krystinaathas: Really interesting. Yeah, that's really interesting. Let me, let me quickly call Danielle just to make sure he knows because.
Christian Sheerer: Cool. Yeah.
krystinaathas: I don't know what he's doing.
Christian Sheerer: I can give him the instructions too, to like call in if that's easier so we can hear him.
krystinaathas: I don't know where I am. That's all right. So. So I guess, like, a couple of questions for you that I can start with. Please hear me. Yeah. Are that, you know, we. We actually were like playing around with the Melio platform. Okay. Is that him? Yeah. Is that him or. No, that was my email.
Christian Sheerer: Oh, yeah, he's popping in.
krystinaathas: Okay.
DP: Sorry, Daniel, I have a new laptop and had to download the stupid app.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, I got you.
krystinaathas: Yeah. I realized quickly there was no zoom on the PC here, but brought my laptop, so. Got it.
DP: Good. Let me see here. Oh, why is there. No, there we go.
krystinaathas: So Daniel, Christian was just telling me, well, first of all, they're in Prospect Heights, which is cool. But also telling me, I was kind of starting to explain that we've been kind of playing around for, you know, one of our. Are smaller, less, less, you know, bulk of stuff with one of the companies. Because we actually have five companies that we pay AP and get AR out of. And we just kind of didn't. There were certain things we didn't like about them. Number one, the pricing that we. That we have to pay for five different companies. And another one is kind of just like the credits are kind of a big one. So just because we have a lot of invoices, a lot of bulk of invoices. So I'm sure you're going to walk it through us. That's kind of our biggest concerns. Along with. We use QuickBooks Desktop for five different companies. So the sync option really needs to be there. And so those are kind of my three big issues that I found.
Christian Sheerer: What do you mean by credits?
krystinaathas: One of our bigger issues is, and this is kind of down the line. I wanted to give you an overview is that, you know, we do return because we're a bookstore. So we buy books from a vendor, get them, and then get an invoice, pay an invoice. And then we have to return some of the books so we get credits. So say we've returned five books and we. The invoice originally was, you know, $20, and we're getting credit for $10 on it. But the credit is kind of just a random credit. And Milio wasn't giving us the option to kind of sync that credit back and forth between quickbook Desktop and Melio, which is important to us because we do have a high volume of credits at some points in time that we need to use. And the system, they. I can explain to it a little bit more down the line if we feel like this works out the way it needs to, because it's not the most important portion of why we're meeting with you, but it is an important part of it.
DP: Okay, let me just jump in there. We also get promotional credit. Like when, like if you host this author from a certain vendor, they'll give you, you know, $100 credit. That's to help with incidentals. So it's basically a credit memo that's got a slightly different kind of invoice in numbering system and then we input it as if it's an invoice, but it's in actuality it's a credit memo. So it's a negative amount.
Christian Sheerer: I got you. Okay, cool. No, I just needed kind of high level clarity around that. But awesome. And so can you walk me through the five different companies and sort of what the spread, AR and AP is as it relates to payments? You don't have to walk me through all the, all the companies, but in full detail. But yeah, what is kind of your. And each one has its own QuickBooks desktop instance.
krystinaathas: Yes.
Christian Sheerer: Cool.
krystinaathas: That's correct. Yeah. We have three bookstores and two publishing companies. Some hire one publishing company in one bookstore, have a higher volume of AP that we need to deal with. You know, we have the industry City one we're in, we have a Dumbo One and we have a Parkslope bookstore. The Dumbo one tends to have the highest volume, but every single one of them has a separate QuickBooks login.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, cool.
krystinaathas: So that, that syncing capabilities needs to be there for each one of them, which is hard to do. I know that. I mean, we have it in organized fashion. It doesn't, I think, sound organized to a lot of people outside of us, but it is. So, so we, we needed to kind of be able to really sync back and forth well between those companies.
Christian Sheerer: And what's the spread of volume between. Between those three and the two.
DP: The the main, the main publishing company usually does about a million dollars a year and its vendors range at any given time it ranges from a hundred dollars to fifty, sixty, seventy, eighty thousand dollars if it's a printer and we printed a lot of books. The, the biggest bookstore does about 750,000 a year in revenue and the medium sized one does about 500,000 a year and the small one does 250,000 a year. So all told, 1.2, 1.4 between 12 and 1 4. All three share. All three bookstores have a much smaller roster of vendors than the publishing companies. Publishing companies will be paying authors advances. When you sign up, a book kids book editor or sorry kids book illustrator or kids book writer will get an advance payment. A thousand bucks, two thousand bucks. And then if they're earned, if they earn royalties, meaning the advances earned out and sales keep going, they'll be owed a few hundred dollars every few months. The large printer has probably about five or six. The large publisher powerhouse has about probably, oh let me think here, probably about six to eight different printers it use, it works with. So there's a number of wires that need to be done. Some do checks. The three bookstores have about seven to 12 vendors that are pretty consistent and that's about it. It rarely, they'll rarely have, they'll never have an individual that needs to get paid. But whenever a vendor like Penguin Random House gets paid, it's usually 40 to 50 to 100 line items that are being paid at one time.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, okay.
krystinaathas: Yeah, almost all the printing publishers, you know, I don't, I can't remember how many are actually international also. So I think we need, yeah, between.
DP: China, Italy, Slovenia and they, these entities get paid by wire and Nickel has the ability to do wire or. No.
Christian Sheerer: We do ach.
DP: Which you can't go international, right?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, not yet. I mean we're building it out. This is, there's like a, you know, a bunch of like regulatory compliance loop, not loopholes, hurdles that we have.
DP: Hurdles.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. And, and make sure that we scale them correctly. But I don't have an exact kind of time frame on when we'll be able to send money out abroad. We currently only collect money in like from international customers for your customers. Right. Via credit card today. So it would be some time before we have international wire. I used to work at a global payroll company and you know, we had this ambition, hey, we're going to launch it in two months and you know, it takes four. So suffice to say, I don't know Exactly. When we'll be able to like send money out abroad via wire because we have to do all the anti money laundering terrorism stuff. Yeah, yeah. And it's likely that. Yeah, it's likely that that pushes to sometime in the next year. And that's like a large portion of the AP for the publishing companies for.
DP: I would say yes, a big production expense is the freight border. And that's based here. So that's eight. That would be ach. But most of the printers, they're either in China or Italy. Some of them have a US Address. And so we can send them a check or we can ach it and then they reinter. Repatriate to. To China. The Italians, though, need to be paid to Italian bank.
Christian Sheerer: Okay.
krystinaathas: We have a period of time, you know, twice a year where we pay royalties, which is also kind of a. Is individuals are paying. And 90% of them, I think, are US based. I'd say.
DP: Yeah.
krystinaathas: So it could work on that aspect and we could maybe figure out the other aspect of the international publishers, which, you know, are not a high volume right now, but can be. Okay. It's actually the kind of. What is my biggest concern is what Daniel was talking about with the stores, the bookstores themselves and the amount of line items that include invoices and those credits that are pulling in a negative amount that we really need those to be in kind of an organized thinking fashion for us.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. And so. And then the AR on the bookstores, that's all point of sale stuff, I'm assuming, or you fill me in.
DP: Yeah, that's Global Payments, which is tied to the POS system. We use a book inventory system called Basil, and their recommended vendor is Cayenne Global Payments.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, I am assuming that's sort of out of scope.
DP: We never really thought about it. Two bookstores, we're running out of checks, which is prompting us to jump on this sooner rather than later. We also have a problem with the two bookstores, have Santander bank accounts that were compromised about a year ago. And now that we. We need to really shift over to Chase. And so that's another reason to look into positioning the ap, at least with the. With the bank.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. Okay. All right. Yeah. Let's focus on the AP bits, how we'll link up to a QuickBooks desktop, how we'll kind of corral them into one account. So we have a setup at the high level to kind of walk through. Christina, your three things that you were chatting through. At the highest level, we have a setup. We call it Four accountants. I mean, I've been lobbying internally and I think we will eventually change it. And you can just translate accountants to parent company and child company. So we work with a lot of accountants who run AR&AP for the businesses that are clients of theirs. And for that reason we have set it up in a way where you can be a master owner of one nickel account therein there are four or five client accounts so you don't have to pay for five of them on the nickel service. And you can also toggle between them without logging out and logging back in. And you can, you know, make sure each of those is linked up to its individual chart of accounts. And then as it relates to QuickBooks Desktop, we have. So in about two months we'll have like a full API integration where there's a two way sync. We have that currently for QuickBooks Online because 90% of people, I mean that's an overestimate. A lot of people use QuickBooks Desktop, but that was like the easiest API to build out. But what we do on like a case by case basis and it would just require kind of like a quick sync between our engineering team and you guys at some point down the line to help explain the logic of the credit system and also just pull kind of your vendor information and customer information from QuickBooks Desktop so that we could, we have like an AI agent essentially that builds out like a, you know, I call it like a 2025 type integration. Whereas like an API where you just pull, pulling in the docs from QuickBooks Desktop is like a 2015 type integr. And so that would probably only be necessary if we were going to spin this up in October for October and November because it's likely that we're just going to have the full API built out by the end of the year. And so that sync will be a lot less burdensome for us. It won't change the burden on your end because we're basically just going to pull the information that you're downloading, you know, on some set cadence. And the number of vendors that have been described there, it's not more than 100, it sounds like. Unless you know, yeah, it sounds like, yeah, that that won't be like too burdensome. It'd be a different situation and we'd have to talk about like what the implementation of that kind of like agentic integration would look like if there were like thousands of vendors. Right. And that are changing all the time. Cool. So I think we'll be able to kind of like accomplish that sync, we would just need some, you know, sync between us. That's like, okay, here's what we need from the credit side and here's how it has to post back up into QuickBooks Desktop. So we could build out that logic and sort of, you know, connect it with the logic of the nickel system.
DP: Okay. Do you, and then I guess my question for you Christine, is that if, if we, if they can massage the, the syncing, that's how you plan to input bills or to get bills out of invoices out of the QuickBooks desktop and into nickel.
krystinaathas: Yeah, I mean I think that that works. If they don't. I mean I, I'm not as worried about the two sided sync right now. I guess if that's what you're saying you don't have yet because it's easy enough for me to mark the build as paid in there. Once they're paid, I mean if that's something that's rolled out, eventually that's fine. It's really the making, you know. And we pull everything in a spreadsheet every month. So we have every line item of an invoice, every line item of a credit, every for every vendor. So if that's also something that until that sync is there, it's easier to upload. We also do that. You know, we have the data in other aspects than just thinking.
DP: Right. We did it with Melia, we did it with. She, she was able to sync all accurately, all the positive invoices, no credit memos synced, but all the positive amounts to synced pretty easily for one company for, yeah, for one bookstore. We, that, the one that had completely run out of checks, we started with that one. We also were able to bulk upload vendors and they have the system whereby you click, you know, you can click a button and the, the platform sends out an email to the email on file asking them to enter their bank data. And once they do that we get notice saying that they're on board and we, they're ready to get paid.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. And, and, and, and that's exactly what's, what's what I'm showing here of what, what happened post sync. So if we do it on that monthly cadence, Christina, you would pull those in and then so we have a list of all the vendors here. I have this little QuickBook sync. That's what I mean by the two way sync. Right. This is QuickBooks Online. It's automatically pulling vendor information that I already have for them and already it has some missing details. But you know, we need to be able to, you know, like you said, request payment information so that they know where they're getting paid. And then we'll store it on file for you. And on the bill side, this is already pulling post sync, right? Or, or I can create a new bill in here and we can make sure that those get matched up between, you know, nickel and QuickBooks desktop. And I think like the value add here would just be the attention to detail on the five different ones as well as being able to corral all five of those with its own individual chart of accounts in one account, one nickel account, versus trying to, you know, click between five different accounts that you're paying different amounts for. And so then when you're sending out the ACH, it's going to be a free ACH, you can, you can pay by card. That's, that's 2.9% if you guys, you know, ever pay via a credit card. But the bill will have, will, will have pulled from. Or you can always upload it, click and, and drag a bill here.
krystinaathas: And.
Christian Sheerer: Then it'll get done to them. Let me see if I have one that I can just send to myself. You can also queue them out into the future. See if I have myself as a vendor. What is the language that we used? What do you pay? Benefit printing. We'll make a payment I don't have. If I have their information, I can put it in here or I can go to that vendor and request a payment information. I can require ACH or can require bank login from them. This is just so that they don't mess up and put in the wrong ACH information. Maybe they already have it and you trust them. You can send it over and then they'll get on their end this email.
krystinaathas: I think that's pretty similar to the way Melio does it too.
DP: Yeah. Miwa also has, has a thing where they assigns you an email address where you can have an invoice, a PDF on some levels you can import a CSV file. But the. I tested sending a PDF and it worked pretty well.
Christian Sheerer: Yes.
krystinaathas: Yeah. I find that aspect difficult for the stores. But like for the publishing companies, that could work flawlessly. I think in a way the store takes some time. There's just so many invoices. Yeah, I know, so many.
Christian Sheerer: But yeah, so the stores. Why is it, why is it so many more? Because there's not seven to eight vendors. There's maybe 50.
DP: No, seven to eight vendors, but there's, you know, in a given month for the large vendor, Penguin Random House. There could be 50. There could be 100 line items that were shipped during that. During that. During that month.
Christian Sheerer: Is that all corralled into one invoice or is it.
DP: No, no, there's like a $10 invoice here, eight there, 1200 over here. Because that was a big reorder. 1753. Basically, when a book comes into stock and there's an advance order, that book only will ship out with an invoice. If you place a large reorder of existing stock, you're going to get. You're. You're going to have a very large bill. Because all these books that are available are shipping at one time. You know, five boxes, but one invoice. And then books that are not yet published, but you know, they're. They're going to be published in December. So those books only will ship in December.
Christian Sheerer: So. So when you. So when you say line item, you're referring to like an individual invoice. Okay, cool. Underneath that vendor. And so we can make sure that those pull over as well too. So I have unpaid bills for vendor 521. I don't know what 521 refers to, but I'm. I have these pulled over from QuickBooks that I can then go and pay out against each of them.
krystinaathas: What about batching them?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, you can always batch them. I can also.
krystinaathas: Per vendor. I mean.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. So if I wanna.
krystinaathas: If you want to pay all those five, two one bills at once, you can do that because that's what. That's essentially what we do. Like Daniel said, We'll have 50 invoices ranging from $1200 to $9. But we have to pay them all. And we don't want to pay them all individually. We want to pay them all in one batch.
DP: I just did Penguin Random House. 42 line items, right? 42 invoices. And the grand total is like $5,800. But it was, you know, it was 42 line items.
Christian Sheerer: And so you. You do. You go. You go by. You go by.
DP: By voice number.
krystinaathas: Yeah. Everything that was doing.
Christian Sheerer: You batch them by vendor is my question.
krystinaathas: By vendor, by date. So we are batching everything. So Daniel said, you know, we did the sink and Daniel went in and everything due on 9:30. So usually random House, at the end of the month, they'll batch in and then we. What. Usually what would happen was we pull everything that was due by 9:30, and then we use all the credit. But Melia was. Is not giving us the option to sync the credits.
Christian Sheerer: Credits. Okay. Yeah, I know we do it, but I need to kind of take that as homework to sketch out how we'll pull in the credits. Just because it's unique, because we've done it for. I have. We have another. We have another customer of ours that's like home care. They work, they operate on. On. On some level of credits for their customers. Like their customers have credits with them because they pay upfront for some amount. And then, you know, the amount of hours that the home care person has spent is maybe lesser or more.
krystinaathas: Right. And then it's also. Sorry, going both ways because the way Melio is playing it out is that they want us to go into Melio and change the amounts to like this invoice was $30 and put that credit towards it for $10. So now that invoice reads $20. But that is not going to pull back into QuickBooks Desktop in a think in the way we need it to, you know, keep our data straight.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah.
krystinaathas: So that was also their explanation of it, which just doesn't work for. For the way we operate. And I was actually very surprised at that because there's such a big platform. So there's also that portion of it is that it really has to sync as if it's an invoice, a negative invoice, and that we know it's going to invoice credit 123 is going to invoice 4, 5, 6. And it has to sync that way. It has to read that way on the remittance. So that way also our vendors know that the very important part of the equation.
Christian Sheerer: I got you. I got you. It's like a. So an invoice for old. Like it's. It's an in. It's basically a reverse invoice. It's like an invoice for your vendor, essentially.
DP: Yeah. They assign a number to it, the whole nine yards. We traditionally, for returns, we wait to take them until. Until we get. Until they process the return. If we return, we, you know, during a given month, we've ordered 5,000 books. And at the end of the month we decide to. Or two months, three months, four months later, that bill's been paid. But then we return, you know, 100 books that may have been on that invoice. It may have come from different invoices. And then so we get basically a credit memo for those 100 books. And they could have originated at different. From many different invoices. It doesn't really matter. Publishers just take vendors. When I say publisher, a publisher is A vendor, they just issue a, you know, a credit memo for the grand total what you sent back and you're allowed to use it, take it against any future payment.
Christian Sheerer: And so, okay, so what I'm envisioning is basically like a animal, an extra column here which is like I have a balance of a hundred for this bill for 5, 2, 1. But the credit memo for 5, 2, 1. I might be able to add like another column here which is like, okay, I can use.
DP: Or you can just. Or it could be a negative amount on the amount column.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah.
krystinaathas: Yeah, I can show you actually like how it's set up in QuickBooks Desktop, which is it, you know, will tell me. I'll go and click off all that are due for Random House in September. And at the bottom of the screen it will tell me you have $253 in credit credits. And I have to go in and assign those credits to an invoice. And I can like maybe one day show you because it may help in terms of how you, how your team sets it up on how that operates because it's, it's a kind of seamless system. But it's just how does it carry over here and to better understand which actually would be good for business anyways for you guys.
Christian Sheerer: I think so too. And I think that was going to be like my prescription of like a next step for us is to really. So like we can accomplish, I know we can accomplish making these credits happen and the kind of two way a little bit more manual on our end of building out this agent sync with QuickBooks Desktop for the time being before we have the full API, just open sieve between Nickel and QuickBooks Desktop and then we can accomplish just making the actual management of the five different accounts pretty simple. But I think now it's like drilling down into the weeds about what it looks like in QuickBooks Desktop, what it has to. Our engineers are good at payments. We're not all accountants. Right. So like sometimes we have to get handheld on, on how it should appear on the QuickBooks desktop for your guys sake. And so I think that's what I would want to set up and bring somebody who would be in charge of kind of building out that first sync between the five QuickBooks desktops. Chart of accounts for Powerhouse and Nickel. And then you can show us in the QuickBooks desktop bit, right?
krystinaathas: Yep.
Christian Sheerer: Illustrate what you're describing. And I have a good download. I was recording this. I hope everybody saw that. And so I have a good download and I can piece it together. Before then too. So we can like, be very targeted and I'm sure they'll have some ideas about. Based on what we've done previously.
krystinaathas: Well, QuickBooks Online does it in a similar fashion. So I just. I'm sure maybe it's just that you don't have a lot of clients that need credits in a. In a manner that we need them, but QuickBooks Online does it. Which is. Which is also when we figure this out. Maybe my next step is to figure out how we can get QuickBooks online. Oh, yeah, this is.
DP: I'm trying to share my screen. I. But I'm not that accomplished.
krystinaathas: It's sharing.
DP: Oh, it is. Okay, so let me scroll up. Let me see if I can make this bigger for me so I can see it. I'm on my little new laptop. So this is an export of our apartment for the industry city store. So you see here one of the vendors, we're paying $1,000 to them for these. The all these invoices right here.
Christian Sheerer: Mm.
DP: Now here, HarperCollins, this vendor, we have a credit of 1323. This amount would be. Would be the total of those. And currently under Melio, I can only.
Christian Sheerer: I got you. This looks a lot easier than. It's like a credit per invoice. You're just summing up. They're summing up all the credits that has shed has given you or that Penguin has given you. And yeah, getting minus the amount of pain.
DP: So I would have. I would have taken these the last payment, but I did not because, yeah, there was no way to. To do it. So instead I paid this amount which is all the positive. And you can see here's all I have to search. I had to cut and paste all these invoice numbers the clip pay because you can see how many line items are in currently Melio for this vendor, it's 142 invoices.
krystinaathas: Right.
DP: Of which only these were due by the end of September.
krystinaathas: And that's partially because they're net. They're net.120. So we're getting these invoices before we are some of our other vendors because. And then they're just later on. And this is also not. The higher volume of credits comes from our Dumbo store. So, like, this does not look like a lot of credits right now, but our. Our Dumbo store actually. And it also depends on the time of year. You know, we have more say in January, February, I think usually. Yeah.
DP: So here I could have taken $55 in credits, but I couldn't on the Melio platform. But it's a lot of cutting and pasting of these invoice numbers and clicking, clicking, clicking. Here was a $91 credit I could not take from for this vendor because the system doesn't allow it and that's its own problem right there. So you can see this medium sized store I was at any given time, you know, right now milo will show 21,394 actually a little bit more because these credits are not factored in. And these, you know, what do we have here? Seven vendors, eight vendors and that's it.
krystinaathas: Yeah, usually that's what I say. Yeah.
DP: And then the one cleaner, he's, he gets, he got paid ACH this year.
Christian Sheerer: Nice.
DP: That was this. Yeah.
krystinaathas: Only for one of the stores though.
Christian Sheerer: Okay. Yeah. Okay.
krystinaathas: Yeah. It's a slow process. It's a lot is a lot, honestly.
Christian Sheerer: Okay. In between now and then. Do you mind actually, I mean depending on your trust. Yeah, that's what I was going to ask for, honestly.
DP: Yeah, sure.
krystinaathas: Yeah. We literally have it for each.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah.
krystinaathas: Every month for all five.
Christian Sheerer: I think just one of them too.
krystinaathas: And.
Christian Sheerer: I think in between now and when we have that full ported API thing we would just grab those for you and then make sure that we're, we're, we're doing it on the back end in nickel so that you can just come into nickel. It should be as simple. I don't want to over promise but it should be as simple as like I come into nickel and make sure that everybody has their delivery method which means like their account that we can pay into there. And I'll batch like I did for the 52 1. I'll batch for hash it. Here are all those line items which are different invoices, the 24 or so or whatever. And I'm going to get my ACH pulled from the Powerhouse account and pushed out to them. And then I think the next step of graduation would just be like you can, you know, once we have that underway you can start to queue up for payments, you know, for those net 120, those invoices that came or those bills that came in on May 31 that I saw in the, in the sheet that are at the end of September, cue them out for payment so that you know, as soon as they come in, I mean depending on whatever the cash flow situation is. Right. And then, and then cue them out to get pulled on that date. Yeah, great. Cool. So yeah. Whether it's all three of us and then somebody from, from our team on the kind of engineering end, or just one of y', all, who. Whoever needs to be in charge of that. I think that's something that we. We should probably set up and deep dive into. And I. I will use this recording, plus that break down that CSV file to kind of prime them and then get us. Get us in a way that's thinking about it in your guys's logic.
krystinaathas: Yeah, I can definitely lead you guys. I'd be the one to lead you guys through the QuickBooks desktop just to show you kind of how we. How we operate that. Happily do that. Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: Okay.
krystinaathas: I would love to get to desktop online at some point, but maybe when Daniel and I are done with this project, we can start trying for some of the smaller ones.
DP: Keep in mind. Keep in mind, Christina. We eventually want to get up and running on batch.
krystinaathas: That's true.
DP: There's a. There's a dedicated platform in publishing or store, retail in particular, that allows you to handle or funnel all of your invoices through a platform that. And then you can pay Penguin, Random House, Harper Collins, and nps, three of the big five, you can handle on them. You can take care of all three of those vendors on a given month by using this digital platform. And you fund the platform through an ACH entity like yourself or Melio. And at some point, it's probably biting off too much to do it right now, but that's the goal at some point is to get the three stores up on what's called batch for books.
Christian Sheerer: Hurry. Okay, cool. That's good. Like, you know, down the horizon thing. Yeah.
DP: Oh, man.
krystinaathas: We.
DP: Did we hit an hour limit? No, not quite.
krystinaathas: Maybe I'll come back.
DP: Yeah. Look at that.
krystinaathas: I could see it. That is bad. Daniel?
DP: Yeah.
krystinaathas: Where were you? Oh, my God.
DP: Yeah, I was in the back in my backyard. There's like a landing that goes out of the kitchen and down some stairs. And on the landing, I had a bunch of. I had weeded the. The patio, took up all the weeds on the patio on Monday, threw them into a bin. And I was consolidating the bins, but as I lifted out of one and put it in the other, debris was falling through the landing, which is, you know, little great slats. And it must have disturbed a nest down there, because in the middle of the night, you know, it was like 9 o', clock, 10 o', clock, and all of a sudden this big dark thing just made it, just landed on my hand. And I heard this. Or I felt this intense pain. And then they were Getting inside my shirt. They were biting me inside my shirt.
krystinaathas: Did you go to the hospital or do you go to like.
DP: No, I just, you know, I didn't luckily didn't get in any anaphylactic or whatever it's called, but it just got super sore today. It's even more sore and really, I.
krystinaathas: Wonder if you need a steroid.
DP: Well, I got corded. Well, I. I think I got a hygiene. Yeah, I got a cream and that actually made it feel better. I also taking Benadryl, but yeah, the right hand useful for much right now.
krystinaathas: Are you. Are you are writing? No.
DP: Yes, I am.
krystinaathas: Oh, that's fun for you. That's great. Perfect. Is he coming back?
DP: I don't know. Sound like it, but I think we're good. I think for him. You've got his email. Maybe send him the three cinnamon. Maybe send them the most recent ap.
krystinaathas: Yeah, I'm gonna go think. Because when you did, did you do you did those Industry City ones recently? Yesterday, yes.
DP: And I see the file I opened on this computer. Something didn't sync to Dropbox, so I've got to go see which computer I was working on. I thought it was one. I think it's the one upstairs. And I made notes, but yeah, Penguin Ram House was paid and it's also in that email. Oh, what is?
Christian Sheerer: Ph.
DP: Payables. Let's sign in there.
krystinaathas: I'm gonna see if. Because I might. Might pull them in New Industry City. Because I just don't want to the ref. If we've already paid them, you shouldn't be in there.
DP: Correct.
krystinaathas: So I'd like. Maybe I'll send them a new paylist.
DP: Yeah, yeah, that's fine.
krystinaathas: Yeah, just for that one.
DP: Right. What we can do is we could dual track Melio and this. Maybe use Melio for another month or so while we upload and get these things. Well, let's see here. Let me think, let me think, let me think. We've already paid September, so next run is next. I guess it's not letting me in. Okay, so I'm just gonna bag this whole situation how.
krystinaathas: He said his computer died.
DP: Oh, yeah. I'm just thinking out loud. Yes. Let's go ahead and mark everything that was paid paid. I'll go back into. I'll find out what computer I was working on and make sure that it's the proper file there.
krystinaathas: Yeah, I'm gonna see if it syncs with it. I wonder if. I mean, do we want to play with the idea that maybe it sounds like a lot and Maybe not the best idea. If. Maybe we can send them 8th Avenue since we only have three checks there and they can play around with the platform how it would work for 8th and we can maybe use that for October.
DP: Okay.
krystinaathas: You think that's too complicated than having Melio for one, nickel for one and checks for Arena?
DP: No, I hear what you're saying.
Christian Sheerer: Super sorry about that.
krystinaathas: No, we're. It's okay. We're still chit chatting.
Christian Sheerer: Okay.
krystinaathas: But we can, we could, we can sidebar and chit chat too.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, I think, I mean, I really. I think we'll be able kind of sort it out. I just wanted to get some time on the books to have one of our engineers who would handle that integration come on and go on deep dive on the QuickBooks stuff.
krystinaathas: Yeah. I can look at my schedule and let you know what would work best for that. Definitely.
DP: Cool. I. I definitely process payment, but I. The spreadsheet I'm looking at is not marked and I don't know what I may have done in terms of either. You know, I don't know. I'm having also some drop. Drop box sync problems with the two new computers I have. So I was trying to get into. What was I trying to do? I was trying to get into PH. Payables. Computer downstairs is not letting me do it. So let me see if I can get in up here. There we go. There we go.
Christian Sheerer: Okay.
DP: Dumb cat payments. Yes, I.
Christian Sheerer: Payments.
DP: Doesn't tell me you're.
Christian Sheerer: Huh?
DP: Oh, let me see if it's a new email. Oh, I'm not finding it right now.
krystinaathas: What I'm doing, Christian, is I'm going to go in and pull more like. Because we paid some. Instead of giving you those old. What we call, we call those pay lists, those spreadsheets. I'm going to send you an updated one because the other ones have things we've paid on them. So we don't want to give them, you know, like information that's not correct if they're going to try to play around with it. So I, I'll send you some new ones and what they'll find.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, yeah. We wouldn't even be implementing it. We would just be analyzing it to sort of understand kind of like the logic as.
krystinaathas: Oh, okay.
Christian Sheerer: That's fine either way. Yeah, I think, I mean an updated one would be good because then if we're doing on, you know, your own nickel account, we can hit the ground running a little bit sooner.
krystinaathas: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. Does good. Does. Oh, I'm super booked Friday, but I Mean, I. I can make time. Does. Does Friday morning work?
krystinaathas: Oh, boy. I'm not sure what time you think. Friday morning I'm free.
Christian Sheerer: Except for 11 to 11:30. Up until 1, I'm free. Or the afternoon after 3:30, I'm free.
krystinaathas: I could probably do at 11:30. Okay.
Christian Sheerer: You want to try for 11:30?
krystinaathas: Yeah. Why don't you put that in China? Cool.
Christian Sheerer: I'll send that invite. And then also what I'll do is just. I'll recap everything that we chatted about across the three and appreciate you guys, like, clear schema on the context of, like, the three things you're looking for, plus, like, the breakdown across the five.
krystinaathas: Yeah, that's a lot of troubleshooting.
DP: Here's a. Here's Amelia's problem as well, is you can only pay. You can only make a maximum of 20 payments for an individual vendor.
Christian Sheerer: Oh, yeah. We have no such limits.
DP: Good God. That's. I didn't do Christina. I didn't do Penguin Random House because I. I spent put. You know, it's been, I don't know, a ton of time, you know, tagging all 42, and then I get an error message saying you can only do 20 at a time.
krystinaathas: I'm so surprised at that. It's just such a. Like, the platforms used by so many different companies that they just, like, have all these, like, weird little things that they can't do. I think that seems simple to me.
Christian Sheerer: I think they pay a lot of prices, play a lot of pricing games.
DP: No, I know some. You know, one level you can import as CSVs, and another level you can't, and it's just, like, you know, just make it easy, you know? Yeah. The maximum amount of bills that can be combined into one payment for single vendor would be 20.
krystinaathas: Yeah, that's. That's not doable. So there you go. Okay.
DP: Oh, my God. We would advise you to break these up into smaller batches to meet our system requirements. Oh, yeah.
krystinaathas: I still, like, can't get it to sync. That's what I'm trying to do now. So that's a whole. Another issue.
DP: Yeah, I'm just. Whatever. All right, so that's. I knew I had a memory flag and everything, so I guess my. That she. Yeah, I was waiting to hear back on this error message, which now I see.
krystinaathas: Okay, problem. That's great. And then also, Christian, can you. I don't. I didn't really look at your pricing, but it would be nice to kind of just have a. Some kind of estimate of what we'd be paying overall per company. However you guys do. It would be great.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, it's just 35amonth. It's probably, probably too good of a deal.
DP: No, but we would have five accounts and five banks and. Got it. But no, that's, that's what I was hoping for with this Melio. And I only learned about these platforms because I was researching batch this. The thing I mentioned earlier, like. Oh, just ach. Because some of our banks don't do ACH or we didn't sign up for them and now we got a problem with two of the banks or one of the banks, two accounts.
Christian Sheerer: Is that how you found us? Just, just a, just search for ACH payment.
DP: I saw the word Melia on this batch and just used ACH platform like Melia to fund your batch, you know, end of month payments. And then I st. I. So I went to Emilio and I signed up and then I started seeing these problems and then I googled and actually nickel comes up all the time in, in these, you know, the AI says, the search says what's better, Nickel or Melio? And it does these pros and cons things and that's how I found nickel.
Christian Sheerer: Nice. Okay, cool. Yeah.
DP: So whatever you got out there, it's worth it.
Christian Sheerer: Hear about that? Yeah.
krystinaathas: Advertising algorithm you got going on work.
Christian Sheerer: There's a lot of stuff back. Yeah, yeah. Trying to, trying to, trying to hack it in. I don't know, in the new world we're living in, it's a little bit crazy, but.
DP: And then do you have a template for uploading vendors?
Christian Sheerer: I mean, typically all we usually need is contact and vendor name. Okay. Yeah. And so if you have like your list of vendors with like, there's probably a CSV that QuickBooks Desktop will create with all that stuff in there. We can match it that way. And if you already have their payment information, that might be something good to pull. But you can always send the, you know, delivery information requests to them through nickel so that they.
DP: Yeah, that's what I've done. They. Melio has a template you gotta put in order. There's a lot of extraneous info in our system, QuickBooks. But what I do is Christina does an output and then I, you know, slice it up for vendors I want to transfer and vendors that are long ago or no longer in existence. But for the three bookstores, it's very. They're all identical, so it's easy.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, pretty much just vendor name their contact, like where we want to send bills or send notifications about Bills. And then ultimately they're the delivery information which is like their account around.
krystinaathas: Okay, that's good to know. All right, that's. I, I'm, I'm good with questions and stuff. If you. Yeah, and then we can. I'll send you, I'll email you those. We call them Payless. Melio's not even thinking now either. So I'm not going to pull you a new one because it doesn't matter.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, I'll summarize. Yeah, I'll summarize all those bits, the higher level stuff. And then I will mainly for myself, but also for y' all kind of sketch out where on Friday we're going to deep dive into based on your guys explanation, which was super helpful. And then finally I'll just remind you of what I think for your guys's homework which is should just be like, hey, download this and send it over the one that Daniel showed already too.
krystinaathas: Yep.
Christian Sheerer: I'll just put that as the bottom of the email and then we'll get together and put our heads together on Friday.
krystinaathas: Yeah, it's kind of cool because I feel like we're building something which makes me feel a lot more secure with it.
Christian Sheerer: It's more exciting for me too because I mean, you know, we have a lot of people who get on and they're like, wow, it's super simple to use. And they have like a very simple like, hey, we just bill for this and blah, blah, blah. It's awesome. And, and that's cool too. But that's part of the reason I enjoy this. I was trying to be an academic when I was in college and then all my, all my professors were like, don't do that. And then I was like, oh, going to fight tech. Yeah, right.
DP: Yeah, go, go.
krystinaathas: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: But yeah, I mean getting to pick the critical thinking skills is fun.
DP: So.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, this is good.
krystinaathas: Yeah, that's great. Okay. All right, well thank you so much. We appreciate it.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, no problem. I have a couple calls right now, but expect that from me in about like an hour or two.
krystinaathas: All right, great. Thank you so much.
Christian Sheerer: No problem.
krystinaathas: Talk soon. All right, bye. Bye.
Christian Sheerer: Bye.
