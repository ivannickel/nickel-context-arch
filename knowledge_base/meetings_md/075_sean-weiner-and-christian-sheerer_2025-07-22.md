Christian Sheerer: Hello. Hi.
Jennifer Marquez: Good morning. How are you?
Christian Sheerer: Good. How are you? Is this Sean?
Jennifer Marquez: It is. Christian, good to see you. Thank you.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. Nice to see you. Glad to connect. I know, you know, you set up this meeting, you know, and so I'm just curious, I guess, like. how you found out about us in the first place.
Jennifer Marquez: Yeah, pretty much a Google search. Yeah. More than that, probably a paid search engine optimization you guys have up there. And I'll tell you exactly what I'm looking to do.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, please.
Jennifer Marquez: We're looking for very narrow, very narrow application, quite frankly. We're a law firm. We do collection law. collection work out of Florida. And what we are looking to do is sort of transition from sending out trust checks at the end of the month to our clients. So we do collection all month, and then we send them checks and reports at the end of the month. I'm looking to transition out of having to send physical checks at the end of the month into a ACH send. solution. We use QuickBooks online. So that's at the end what I'm looking to do as my primary goal.
Christian Sheerer: Oh, yeah. Oh, you guys are in, in Broward County, right?
Jennifer Marquez: Ah, Dave.
Christian Sheerer: Oh, I saw the 954. That's where I'm from. I'm from Pembroke Pines.
Jennifer Marquez: Okay. I grew up in plantation.
Christian Sheerer: Oh, awesome. Yeah. So cool. A little connection there.
Jennifer Marquez: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: I mean, what's the problem with QuickBooks online?
Jennifer Marquez: No problems with it. We just, you know, their solution for sending ACH is, I think, 100 bucks a month or so, a little bit more than we wanted to spend for this. We integrate just fine, but I'm looking for the solution to be able to actually send those ACH payments out.
Christian Sheerer: So it sounds like there is, yeah, some friction with just paying.
Jennifer Marquez: Yeah, just expensive. And I thought that your solution might be a little more cost effective for the narrow goal that we have to send ACH payments.
Christian Sheerer: And do you have any other types of payments? So you're moving away from checks, if I'm clear, right?
Jennifer Marquez: Correct.
Christian Sheerer: Okay. And so then moving towards ACH, don't want to do it through QuickBooks Online, you're going to keep them as your ERP, I assume?
Jennifer Marquez: Yeah, we're going to keep that as our core system. We're just looking for somebody that integrates with them that actually offers the, because QuickBooks Online natively does not have ACH sending functionality. We're not looking to receive, we already receive, we've got a processor that already receives ACH. This is just strictly the send function.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, and what is the processor that helps you receive?
Jennifer Marquez: We use USA ePay through payment savvy right now.
Christian Sheerer: Okay. And what is, I guess, what's the desire to not evaluate changing on that end? Because the idea and where Nickel kind of can help, I guess, on the receivable end is folding that into one platform. So you truly have like an all-in-one dashboard for accounts receivable, accounts payable. So I'm just curious what the savvy you said, savvy.
Jennifer Marquez: It's pretty savvy. Yeah, I mean, let's put this way, if you can provide a cheaper solution, I'm happy to look at it from a payment processing perspective. That's not my main goal. We're always happy to see if we can find a better solution. The problem that we have and we've had in the past is, A lot of payment processors do not like, even though we were a law firm, we were licensed as a law firm, we were licensed attorneys. A lot of payment processors, including the big ones, don't like doing collection work from an AML/BSA perspective, and they don't allow, as part of their terms and services, collection law firms. So we had a very difficult time finding, you know, I know the big ones, PayPal and Square and law firm, the couple of those law pay, whatever they are, they would not do collection law firms. So that's why I was not looking to move that, because it's been working and we've had a good relationship. I'm just looking for that outgoing ACH module.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, I heard you. And let me see if I can do a little bit of digging on what was the kind of structure that you, like, tagged. There was an acronym there for why they don't some regulatory situation as to why they don't take on.
Jennifer Marquez: It's a BSA AML issue. Bank Secrecy Act, American Money Laundering Act.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, okay, okay. Yeah. The reason I think we might be able to help you there. And then the second question would be like cheaper compared to what you're currently paying Rik Savy. And again, I'm going to make it super simple on the accounts payable side. Like we could do that for you. You could start, you could send a payment today. For free on ACH. And so I'll check that box, but I'm just curious on the other thing. Just because I think it might be easier for you not to have to go between Nickel, Savvy, and QuickBooks Online and you just have Nickel do that. The reason I go into that digression about the receivable is because we're set up as more, we were built with industrial small businesses in mind, which has really fine tuned our focus to the security of payments because those transactions are super large, right? Like a small transaction in that industry is like $1,000,000. And so we've set up a way that we could like have direct secure payment link 1 to 1, gone through all of the, you know, compliance hurdles, which are a lot larger for types of transactions like that than quick ones like, you know, like a PayPal would have to go through. And so I think I'm glad you just like tagged that BSAA.
Jennifer Marquez: BSAA, AM/ML.
Christian Sheerer: Cool. I can go back to the team and once you start using the tool to send out payments, I think you'll find it pretty easy. Like it works in reverse simply as well. What are you like, what are you typically charged when you are receiving payments and like what methods go through. Is it just like a transfer and ACH through the Savvy pay?
Jennifer Marquez: No, I can't take all credit. I take all credit card. I don't know. I don't remember our pay structure. I. For inbound ACHs, I spend, I think, a middle of 25 to 30 bucks a month. And I spend like a quarter, the transaction.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah.
Jennifer Marquez: So, and I'm in a mess. It's been a long time since I've. I've looked at that. We have a flat fee and a couple of discount. fees. I think we end up, we probably run, I don't know what the numbers are now. Again, I haven't looked at that. It wasn't the point of, you know, my primary purpose is how I'm probably running, I don't know, probably about 100,000 through my credit card processor every month, roughly. I'm probably doing, I don't know, 400 transactions for, I think it was, I think when we looked at it was between 400 and 500 credit card transactions a month. And then I do minimal, probably about 50 ACH transactions a month. Again, I haven't looked at the numbers in a long time, but that's what memory serves.
Christian Sheerer: And do you know, and, and, and maybe we do this in, like, a phased thing. and make the stakes pretty low, right? Like how I described, you know, get set up with a payable, start managing transactions that way, and then think about receivable. But do you know, I know you just said you don't have the numbers right in front of you, but do you know roughly what you're paying on those credit card transactions or what the customers are?
Jennifer Marquez: So we don't pass due to the FAR rules, we don't pass the fee on to the customers. or FD CPA rules, we're probably paying, I don't know, about a cent and a half, I think between a cent and a half and two cents is my guess, plus the per transaction fee. That's what rings a bell, but I just don't remember for the life of me.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, yeah, no worries. I mean, I think the thing I would tag there is part of the same or for the same reason as to why we were like, let's try to make a platform that we could do big ACHs pretty cheap. We also do pretty good when we negotiate with our banking providers who are helping us move the money on credit card. So 2.99% and that's typically like a couple thousand dollars of savings. on the year or for, you know, people who move like a lot of money per month within the month. So I think like we'd probably be confident in that conversation or, you know, comparison as well. And so just something to keep in mind.
Jennifer Marquez: Let me ask this question.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah.
Jennifer Marquez: We're gonna go the pricing. The couple of things that are critical to us is the platform for like users to see what the platform looks like and then be We also use our current, it's through USA ePay. So in essence, the portal itself or the online terminal that we have is USA ePay, which is provided by the Payment Savvy. But we also use that for our customer facing or a debtor facing module. So we've built a website and a payment platform online Based on that, do you also offer that front line and is that something that you're able to help us build or have off the shelf type capacity to build something like that?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, we do that a lot. So I'll show you that first actually because I think that's, is that the typical way that people, is that a majority of those?
Jennifer Marquez: I either, so I've got our website that has a pay now. Functional. That's probably about 25%. The other is probably about 70% is people either calling in or recurring payments that we do and we manually process those on our interface. But I have to have the customer-facing interface. I've hosted that on my website. It's hosted elsewhere. I have a link on my website, right? If you're looking at it, you probably see it. Mm-.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. Right.
Jennifer Marquez: So I've got an ACH one, I've got a credit card one, but that's pretty much critical. And the reason I've got it set up that way is that I have a QR code that goes on my letters that brings them to that website. So it's easy payment. The things that- and we can do the same.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah.
Jennifer Marquez: The things I have not been able to do just because of technical capacity is I haven't been able to add Apple Apple Pay or Google Pay to my website, things like that. I've got the Apple Pay ID and I've got it. They just weren't able to integrate the merchant ID, the payment ID. We just weren't able to integrate things like that.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. And so this is a customer of ours that we love and they like us too. So we can talk about them. They're like a parts seller. And so when we go to their website similar to yours. They can, people can just pop in, pay an invoice, right? Reference the reason why, and then make that payment. I don't want to make the payment just yet, but we're going to be handling the processing of that. And so that is Payment data never has to get passed on either side. The other thing that we can do is we have payment authorization forms. So if you have recurring or you need to pull out from people just without them having to send another invoice, you can do that too via Nickel, and then that'll automatically push into QuickBooks right away. So we have native integration with QuickBooks.
Jennifer Marquez: Every time we send- so we don't push into QuickBooks. This is all on a proprietary system. I have debtors that owe our clients money. They pay us. We do not track that in QuickBooks.
Christian Sheerer: Okay. Yeah. No need to connect those. I sorry, I was just operating under that assumption that all of the payments are going to go through QuickBooks. But I guess for the ones that are just going to the firm itself, those are connected to QuickBooks.
Jennifer Marquez: Everything that we do online goes into my trust account. it's all payment on behalf of others.
Christian Sheerer: Okay. Okay. Yeah. And so it's not a hard and fast requirement that it'll automatically connect to QuickBooks Online. It's just that for those payments that do need to get tracked in the ERP and reconciled, we'll just do it automatically.
Jennifer Marquez: So why don't we do this? Can you show me or do you have anything that any more information about sending out? Again, I want to look at my priorities, right? Priority one is I've got to be able to send payments. Priority two is I think, you know, just if you could beat, match or beat, we'll talk about priority two, which would be converting over and potentially looking at another solution. That was something I was thinking about at the first time, but I'm happy to to talk about it, but I'd like to just start with the sending out and how to send ACHs. And then if you want to propose some pricing, I'm happy to talk about it and see what it would do for us.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, yeah. I mean, so like priority two, just to capture it really quickly, you know, if you're setting up that payments portal, 2.99% on incoming credit card, I'd have to get more information about like the bar specific passing on, but we have it set up and like, you know, we've done a lot of due diligence and making sure that we're doing it compliantly, that we can sort of like with disclosure and have them, you know, take on some of those or some spread of that 2.99%, but for priority one, we know the rules.
Jennifer Marquez: There are other things we just can't pass that on. We understand that.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, and so for priority one, you will have your vendors in here, whoever you're making a bill payment out to, you can add them, you can add a new one, you'll drop that number, you'll make that payment.
Jennifer Marquez: Would I be able to do so? Let's talk about the QuickBooks interface. Would I be able to create the payments in QuickBooks? These are my trust payments.
Christian Sheerer: Correct.
Jennifer Marquez: Would I be able to create those in QuickBooks and then pass it on to actually effectuate the payment?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, yeah. So these ones are coming from QuickBooks. So they were made in QuickBooks, right? Popped already in and then you're making that payment. You'll select whatever payment method you want to use, however the delivery is going to happen, right? Direct deposit via ACH. and then it'll show you that time frame. They'll get a notification that says Marquez, right, Newman and Marquez PA is making a payment to you via here and they'll be able, anybody who's used like a phone or an email right before can make it pretty clear about how they're going to receive it.
Jennifer Marquez: So it doesn't just go, it's not just directly deposit, they have to do an affirmative action to receive it.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, I mean, if you have their vendor details, then it'll go through, but yeah, if it's brand new, then they're going to have to accept it in some way.
Jennifer Marquez: So these are going to be our existing clients, we would receive their info, we would obtain their checking information. in order to send them these payments. So what you're saying is that the first time they would have to do something else to set themselves up, they won't just auto deposit.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, it's just like a slight, you know, you know, the way I frame it is like, same way it took me when I joined the team, you know, about a couple days to learn the platform less. to learn this particular function, they just have some education on there and it's like, okay, I'm getting paid, you know, via nickel to make it a lot easier so that we don't have to spend or, you know, X amount on the ACH and make it quicker, higher limits on ACHs, et cetera.
Jennifer Marquez: I'm not understanding because normally when I think of an ACH going through, it just we as the sender will initiate the ACH, the receiver will, in essence, receive it in their checking account without any other resistance.
Christian Sheerer: That's what I- yeah, the only resistance is you having their information. It's like whether or not we have their account routing number.
Jennifer Marquez: So if I have their account routing number and checking account number, It will actually act as if it were just, it will just go through.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah.
Jennifer Marquez: Without any resistance, it wouldn't pop them up. It'll just go through without any question. If I don't have theirs, so let's say it's the first time I'm sending it to a vendor or a client, it will send them an email and say, please provide your checking account. We've got a payment for you. Please provide your checking account number and routing number in order to get that payment. Is that what I'm understanding? But as long as you have it, it just goes right through. Okay. And what are the costs to actually send the ACH? And what are the limits for the sending of the ACHs?
Christian Sheerer: So zero. zero cost on the actual transaction. So no fees on the ACH. The limit for the free plan to getting on Nickel for each transaction is $25,000. If it's $25,001, you'll have to use Nickel Plus, which is 35 bucks a month.
Jennifer Marquez: And you said that it actually interfaces directly from QuickBooks. So I write 100 checks in QuickBooks.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah.
Jennifer Marquez: Normally that's what my, and most of them are 25,000 or less. But I write the, I write the checks. through QuickBooks, it will send Nickel all of the information for each check and it will initiate the ACH. It'll know based on the vendor that I'm sending it to. We actually had all those clients in QuickBooks. It'll know based on QuickBooks, the client, it'll know whether I have their routing number. Do I put the routing number in QuickBooks or in or a nickel when I do the initial setup.
Christian Sheerer: Oh, you're, you're, it'll pull from, so we'll, we'll pull all the necessary information to make the payments from QuickBooks, if that's how you're setting it up.
Jennifer Marquez: Well, it will be. But I, I just, I'm just trying to understand, does the routing account number, is that held on my system, or is that, is that coming from QuickBooks or does that have to be set up through nickel?
Christian Sheerer: No, no, no, it can be set up just through QuickBooks once and then we'll pull all of that stuff and then we'll reconcile it after the payment is made back into QuickBooks.
Jennifer Marquez: And then, so it sends all 100 transactions, it'll pay them. If it doesn't have an account number and a routing number, it'll take the email and we'll send them an email of some form that says, Please provide, please provide it. If it gets rejected for any reason, what happens then?
Christian Sheerer: We will be looking at it in the case that it gets rejected. Rejected, when has that come up?
Jennifer Marquez: Has the wrong, the client changed their checking account number. So it goes to a bad checking account number now. It gets returned for whatever reason because they can't find the accounts closed, the accounts fraud, whatever it is, pay no credits on the account. Or you ask for somebody's information and they never provide the information, right? You know, you send them a give me your account number and they don't provide it. It's got to come back some way.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. And so we have visibility into like our support team is, you know, in the US working around the clock. And so we have visibility into how payments go through in the case that there are issues and we'll be able to flag it.
Jennifer Marquez: But.
Christian Sheerer: You can always, in the case that there isn't a delivery method or their payment details aren't set up in one way, we can request that delivery information from this is a vendor, for example, that you would be paying out from them through the platform. So a couple layers of right, one, I don't have their information. I need to pay them. I have missing details. Maybe they, you know, remove the payment or you never added their payment information. You can request it. or two, it's changed. They didn't receive a payment. I guess I would say the first line of defense is just making sure that they've put it in correctly. But we have visibility into the payments that are made through the platform so we can flag for any risks or missed payment.
Jennifer Marquez: And she's concerned that the office manager gives us a not, like, like a. Hold on one second. You know how you hear about these frauds and scams and everything like what? the option just to send the money. Again, this is my trust account, so I'm very concerned about what happens to the accountability of all the funds. If it rejects, does it bring the money back by any chance?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, so we're responsible for making the payment. So we're taking on the kind of the liability of the transaction happening. And so we're very kind of like attuned to, and this is sort of like in this industry, like where we get offloaded the risk of fraud happening to us. And so the exact mechanism of like refunding, I'll have to just pull out for you and like send you in an email. But the short of it is yes.
Jennifer Marquez: I mean, let's be clear, no, in a law firm, I'm responsible for my trust accounts and I have full accountability with I have a third party vendor. So I have to account for every dollar that comes in and out of the law firm account. If it doesn't get to where it needs to go, I get that you say that you've got accountability, but I'm accountable with my law license online. So just to be clear. So yeah, I need to know what happens if the payment can't go through to where it goes that how it gets refunded back. And then is there any affirmative match of any form? And you know, I talked about the fraud to make sure that the intended recipient, the account number matches the intended recipient.
Christian Sheerer: Affirmative match?
Jennifer Marquez: Somebody, somebody. It's going to a client's office, but the office manager gives their personal checking number. The affirmative match of we know that the name is matching or at least fuzzy matching the account number.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, I mean, I again, I would have to pull out the exact specific mechanism, but yeah, we don't. because we also have the information on the receiver end, even if they're not using Nickel, if they're just receiving money through Nickel, right? Like we have the connection to their account too, so that we're, you know, not just sending money into the Ether, just sending some money into some account that isn't like connected to the actual, you know, where the payment should be received. and so I don't know, like, in a sentence, what the, like, strict mechanism for that is. So those are the two things I would have to pull out for you and get you in writing in an email of, like, okay, if the office manager puts in her personal account, like, what happens here? Because, like, frankly, yeah, you know, we. It's. We're sort of part of the service that we're. we're helping with is making sure that we don't have fraudulent transactions that could be, you know, obfuscated as, hey, this is just a mistake. I put in the wrong account routing number. So, like, the short answer is yes, but I I I want to be thorough and give you, like, a very clear reason. I'm just gonna have to talk to the kind of like the fraud team, part of our engineering team.
Jennifer Marquez: All right, so let's, so the pricing is just, so your inbound pricing is just $2.99 across the board.
Christian Sheerer: On credit card, that's, yeah, ACH is going to be free.
Jennifer Marquez: Okay. So if you can send me those couple of things, let me just think about it. Is there any place to watch or see like a demo of how the send ACH function works by any chance?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, I'll send you a full comprehensive demo on both sides, ARAP. and then I will get you in the same breath, in the same email, get you that to those two pieces. About. Affirmative matching and what happens if it is rejected. And then three, I'll also send some information about how to get set up if you wanted to, because you could get set up for free today to send out an ACH, run a test, and then we we can come back to a conversation if there are any more in-depth questions based on those tests that get run.
Jennifer Marquez: And I'd be able to change, so if I were to do a test, I would be able to change the account I send ACHs from, you know, if I would do a test, I can't test out of my trust account. I can just see the process through another account to see what it looks like. Okay, all right, let's do that then. I appreciate the time and I look forward to the email and we'll be in touch with the rest.
Christian Sheerer: Awesome. Yeah. Do you know when you likely have a turnaround for that test, for example, being set up?
Jennifer Marquez: Probably the next week.
Christian Sheerer: Okay. Do you want to just book some time for next week, maybe no longer than 15 minutes, just to double check and then see if there are any other questions from the use of the platform initially?
Jennifer Marquez: Yeah, we can do that. Let's do next week at the same time. Cool.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, I'll throw some time on the calendar. I'll put 30 minutes just in case we need it. But if not, like, you know, if everything's groovy, then, then we can chat about something else or, you'll be all set up to go. And if you have any kind of like, strangling questions.
Jennifer Marquez: Okay, great. I appreciate it, Christian. Have a great day.
Christian Sheerer: You too. Bye. Bye.
