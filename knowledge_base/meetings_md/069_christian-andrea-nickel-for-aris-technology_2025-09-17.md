Christian Sheerer: Better than it not going.
Andrea: So, I mean, I'm just as a quick update, you probably can tell or, I don't know, maybe you can't, but I've started the account. I invited my boss, the only other user. I don't know if he accepted yet. And I'm going to upload. I just, I mean, I saw Miguel's email yesterday. From support about how to connect without using Plaid. We're not really interested in giving our login credentials. I understand it's not something you guys clearly would not have our login credentials, but my boss doesn't want login credentials anywhere. So that's fine.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, some people don't like to use Plaid.
Andrea: Okay, so we'll do the alternative. I just don't have the, I haven't had time to upload the three, statements yet, but I'll do all that. I plan on doing it probably by tomorrow, to be honest. We ended up collecting that payment. And again, this is not the only reason I was looking for a solution. It just became the, you know, reason why I didn't work or moved it up in priority was for that one payment. We ended up doing a workaround for that.
Christian Sheerer: So.
Andrea: But like I said, I still. That's not even the only reason that we looked into this. So we still will be using. You guys, once we get this all set up.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, so. Okay. Yeah, I'm. No, no, I'm just hearing, like, a. Like a. Like, excuse me for reading too much into the tone. It's. It's totally fine. Yeah. It just was a delay in getting the.
Andrea: Yeah, yeah.
Christian Sheerer: I mean, it's nothing.
Andrea: It's not a big deal. Cool. I mean, we did a workaround to get the payment a different way, and. That was a small payment anyways, $900. But we still intend or I wouldn't be on this call if I didn't.
Christian Sheerer: No, absolutely. Absolutely. And so did you get so I can see some of the support conversations, but otherwise I am sort of obscure.
Andrea: Yeah, I mean, I think I have everything I need.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, cool. And then I guess when is the Apart from that 901, when do you think the next one?
Andrea: That's the one I was referencing. That's already done.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, exactly.
Andrea: So check mark done on that thing. But again, that wasn't the only reason that I wanted to move forward with this. Of course, it just moved it up. This payment processing wasn't on my Q3 list of things I wanted to accomplish, but. So anyway, it'll be fine and we'll get going on it as soon as I have the statements uploaded and so forth. And like I said, I hope to do that tomorrow, if not by the end, you know, on Friday.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, cool. And just so I have a sense of when we can kind of check back in on how those first bits of transactions after you get onboarded are going, do you have Do you have, apart from the 901, do you have any more kind of coming down the pike?
Andrea: Well, I mean, to be honest, I think what I'll probably first do is pay out some, like our contractors, for example. So that makes sense to me as our first way that we'll use this because, you know, it's essentially almost internal, right? I mean, these are people, you know, that work for us. So if they had a problem or if we had a problem, they could just come right, to us and say, oh, yeah, hey, I ran into this issue. I'm pretty sure you guys have it all ironed out or you wouldn't be, you know, a growing company that you are. So, yeah, but, I mean, I think we'll probably start with that. I don't recall where we're at in there. Like I said before, we pay them probably about every two weeks. So I am sure we will make some sort of payment. And remind me, we can't. Yet do a payment outside of the US. We can receive money, but we can't do payments outside the US quite yet.
Christian Sheerer: But you can receive credit card transactions from somebody abroad. Yeah. I so I know you have a banking background, but I don't know if it's stretched international anyway, just like The settings, the rails are crazy. I'm sure you.
Andrea: Yeah, I can imagine. I mean, there's a lot of regulations.
Christian Sheerer: It's like, you know, you gotta make sure you're not sending money to. And yeah, you got Syria or whatever. Venezuela, whatever. Yeah, it's like, yeah, it's crazy. I worked at an international payments company before I joined Nickel and we were like, hey, we're gonna get international payroll ready to go. It should be ready. I'm just throwing out random days like October. And then it was like June of next year.
Andrea: And it's like, hey, I can imagine. I mean, I do really respect any of the companies that do make these things happen on an international basis because I can only imagine there's so much regulation here in the US. And then when you end with good reason, right? You don't want to be terrorists or something. Or people that do all sorts of terrible things. So I can imagine how difficult, you know, much like the correlation is the, to what we do, because we have a lot of Regulation because we're a federal contractor. It's like, wow, you know, for all those businesses that aren't highly regulated, that are just a business. Wow. How easy, how simple.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah.
Andrea: So anyway, all right, well, I will let you go, but I will, I think maybe in two to three weeks, we could touch base again. And I can probably in three weeks, it'd be safe to say that I will have had something up and running because I'm assuming once I, and I say that because I'm assuming once I upload our, you know, three bank statements and have entered our bank routing and account numbers, then I can immediately start using this, correct?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, yeah, correct. Yeah, people, people. Who, you know, people who use Plaid is sort of like just the new age version of doing what you're going to do right quicker. Right? That's literally all it is, essentially. And so, yeah, so people who do it that way, you know, get started and send yes, the short answer is you can get it set up and send a transaction that day or receive one. So, yeah, just so I'm covering all my bases here.
Andrea: Is that one of our projects? Oh, sorry, go ahead.
Christian Sheerer: Oh, no, go ahead.
Andrea: I was going to say, I think, I mean, I know you told me you have an entire team that's going to contact me about how to fully utilize essentially Nickel or Nickel. And so I think what I'll probably start doing is just kind of prepping and getting my thoughts together of, okay, who you know, everything that I intend to do and then just be ready for having that meeting, but then start chunking away at it and, you know, getting our maybe our AP first and then set it up so that, okay, any new customers, we just have a way that, okay, we're going to be doing this for any new customer for existing customers. You know, I don't like to do things in the middle of a project because it could upset the apple cart and they could say, well, that's not what we agreed to. And you know, we're, we, not everything-.
Christian Sheerer: Definitely an agreement with you there. Yeah.
Andrea: Yeah, yeah. Not everything is project based, but you know, for that that is project based, you all get pushback and people will tell me, well, that's not what we agreed to. So, but I would foresee that we would be able to do this for accounts receivable for the future and love it. So and I may talk to my, you know, my leadership and find out, hey, do they want me to broach this topic? You know, because these other these companies could say, oh, yeah, that makes it easier for us. So anyway, all right. Well, I will let you go, Christian. Thanks for your time. I really do appreciate it. And if you want to set something up for, say, three weeks down the road, that's great.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, absolutely. Let's do it. And just so I'm covering my bases, So yeah, so I can handle the handoff, typically. Yeah. You want to do like end of September, 29th or the 30th, or I guess.
Andrea: I mean, I can't promise that I've had, we'll have had a lot of action by then, but perhaps. So, I mean, I was kind of thinking first week of October.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. Yeah. We are actually, yeah. In one of the, it's funny to, it's, I don't mean to say, ugh, because it's fun, but we are, you know, in the typical small team fashion before we go and get super big. We're going to Mexico.
Andrea: Oh, nice.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. Yeah. Which is. Which is. Which is super fun. But I'm like, you know, as a person who likes to. Likes to work, I'm like, oh, we gotta have five days where we're just, you know, having fun. But so, yeah, I I. We can do.
Andrea: Work comes back to you. It's like the tough thing is.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, exactly. Yeah. I was just looking at it. I'm like, oh. It's the first time I've had to set something up on the calendar and I'm like, I have a whole week where I can't. So yeah, you can do it before you go. Yeah, yeah. You want to set some time for the 3rd of October?
Andrea: Yeah, that's fine. Yeah, yeah.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, cool. I'll send that over. And then the other thing I was going to ask was, is it going to be primarily or only you kind of using Nickel on your team or is there something else?
Andrea: Well, actually, no, like I said, I did invite my one of my two bosses, one of the owners. So he will, I will teach him how to use it. I can't promise he's going to use it. Christian, to be, to be completely honest, yeah, it'll probably be me said doing most of this, but he could at times do it. I want him to be able to do it. So again, yeah, say I'm out on a long weekend or something and something needs to happen, he can actually.
Christian Sheerer: You.
Andrea: Know, know how to do it.
Christian Sheerer: So, yep. And, and, yeah, it's, it's a pretty easy, like, internal education stuff, but sometimes people have. Yeah. Yeah. As long as they wanted to come through. And, and, and so I'm just making that time available to y'all as well. If we, if we need to hop on and educate anybody else who's going to be using the system.
Andrea: Yeah, I mean, that might be helpful for a run through. And I would say, don't do it till you're back from Mexico because I'm pretty sure I will be able to get on there and absolutely no problem. But then it would be great by then I may have some questions for you and so forth of regarding using it. But it would be good for him to, I sometimes like to, Hey, if I'm the one that's training, believe me, it just sounds like, you know, but if somebody from the outside do a training, it just makes it a little bit easier, probably for our team to learn. And right now, it will be only the two of us that use this.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, cool. So awesome. So game plan here. Yeah, run those first couple of vendor or your contractor slash vendor payments. Out. And then we can troubleshoot those reconnect check in on how any of that has gone over the course of the end of this month. And then the beginning of October before I head out, we'll have that check in and we'll game plan. Okay, do we need to run a training for anybody else? And then I can introduce you to our customer success team who will then schedule on a cadence that just makes sense for y'all because, you know, a lot of this stuff is again, super foolproof, but we'll schedule sort of reviews of the platform on a, you know, maybe quarterly or if you guys want monthly Cadence and you'll have dedicated, not, I mean, support is always available all the time, but it's sort of a dedicated person keeping you up to date on all things like new features, Etc. Yeah.
Andrea: Great. And then I guess I did have two questions for you that I wanted to make sure I got clear. So is all of our data, so you know, of course we're going to have our customers in there. Some of our customers are federal contractors, other federal contractors, some of them are actually Department of Defense and so forth. Is all of our data stored in the US?
Christian Sheerer: Yes.
Andrea: Okay. I mean, on servers in the US is what I should have said, but yeah.
Christian Sheerer: Yes.
Andrea: Okay, good. Um, well, that was really my primary question. I thought I had one more, but I don't know. It's fine. I'll follow up with an email if I, if I do think of it. So, all right. Well, thanks for your time, Christian. Really appreciate it.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, you too. Um, always a pleasure. And yeah, and if you have any questions, like that. If that one comes back to you, then, yeah, email me. Whatever.
Andrea: Sounds good. All right. Thanks, Christian. Okay, you have a good one.
Christian Sheerer: Thanks. Bye. Bye.
