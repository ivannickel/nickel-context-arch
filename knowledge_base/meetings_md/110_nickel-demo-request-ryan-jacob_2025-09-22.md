Ryan Jacob: How's it going? Good.
Christian Sheerer: Ryan, how are you?
Ryan Jacob: Doing great. Doing great.
Christian Sheerer: Can't come. Hey, what's up, Josh?
Ryan Jacob: Good. Pretty good. Christian, can I ask a silly question before we start? Yeah. So some of the organizations I've worked for in the past, we had, like, you know, SDRs who qualify the call, and then you'd have, like, the AES who would be the ones who are actually going deep. Are you an account executive STR or what's the dynamic here? Yep.
Christian Sheerer: Performer.
Ryan Jacob: The former. So, sdr?
Christian Sheerer: No, account executive.
Ryan Jacob: Okay. So. Okay. Sorry. So good. All right. I just wanted to make sure. Because we're in a bit of a. A spot with our build a situation. And so I think what we're looking at, we're wanting to do pretty expeditious, and so I'm glad. I'm glad it's you. That's good. Cool.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, we can. We can spin things up pretty quickly. I've worked at places where we have to prime people to be prepared for, like, four weeks of work to implement. You could start running a transaction today, I think, pretty confidently. And that might be the horizon of our 30 minutes. You still have 30 minutes?
Ryan Jacob: We still have 30. I actually have a little bit longer if we need it again, this is a big deal. I can give you the background on it if you'd like. I don't know what would be most helpful.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, typically there kind of background on gra, what you guys are doing and, like, what you're doing on the. I'm getting, like, a lot of feedback.
Ryan Jacob: Yeah. I'm gonna mute you. Josh Morphy, can you. What's that going? There we go. Is that better?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah.
Ryan Jacob: Cool.
Christian Sheerer: Awesome. All right. Yeah, yeah. Background on, like, what GRA does and specifically with regards to payments. Right. And how you guys are accepting them and sending them out. Now, because we do AR and ap, then I can give a high level of what nickel does. We poke around the platform a little bit, make sure you're familiar. It takes a. It takes the IQ of somebody very dumb to internalize it. So I think it'll be pretty easy to get through it. And then we can get to the end of, like, okay, how does the setup work? And we can plan out how we move forward and running those first couple of transactions. Meet that timeline.
Ryan Jacob: Sure. Yeah. So what we do, we are a. A supplier. We work in the chemical industry specifically with a lot of utility companies doing. It's a two part full phone. So we have an A and B part goes in a bucket. They mix it, pour it into the ground. And that's what these are major utility poles. So that's 90% of our business is with these major utility providers. And so a lot of that is going to be ACHS or checks that come in. But usually we just do this directly through Chase is our bank. What we use Intuit for is, you know, managing all those transactions. And then we recently tried to move over from a paper bill like a check type system to something where we were using ACHS whenever possible, cutting checks when necessary. But we're trying to move everybody to ACH because it's simpler for them and safer for us. And that's going to be paying vendors primarily. That was what we use that for. We are a pretty fast growing company. So we're doing maybe did about 13 million in revenue last year and we're up about 20 or so this year. So our vendor numbers are increasing. We're moving to like weekly trucks where we're putting in weekly POS and sending, you know, checks and different things during those times too. So I was just tired of manually typing in those things and printing them. So we switched to an MRP system. It helps us deal all of our orders. And what I need this to do is the cool thing about quickbook bill pay is if we got a PO and I could forward that email to an email address inside of QuickBooks and it would use AI to create the bill for me. It would match that to like existing vendors. I can just scan through it, make sure it doesn't look crazy. Did they categorize it right? Hit create or schedule to pay and I could schedule that for now or I could schedule it out until, let's say we want to use the whole net 30. Awesome. That's primarily what I'm using the bill pay side for. Something else to keep in mind though, we do have an E commerce side and we do that mostly with the consumers. And what we are also interested in is making sure whatever solution we use will allow us to send a payment link to a customer to allow them to pay for an order. I don't because I think, I think we use WooCommerce right now for our online payment solution and then the other one comes through Amazon. And so I don't think we'd have to take payments from them any differently. I think it's more about we have call ins that come in and to be PCI compliant, being able to send them a link to pay instead of giving us the credit card number is something that we'd be interested in. Unless there's a simpler solution that ties everything in there. But my primary use case was I want to pay my vendors easier. I want to schedule that, I want to do that with an ACH payment. And QuickBooks is working great. We had an issue with a change of presidents. So my father in law, my late father in law was running the company, passed away, I took over. QuickBooks has been nothing but headaches trying to get things switched over. I gave them everything they asked for and then they still shut off our bill pay account. And I've already spent hours on the phone with them. I don't want to do it anymore. The other thing I'm interested in too is like if we have an issue, what kind of support is offered, can I actually talk to a person versus, you know, have to submit stuff and the only way they'll do is review things and take days to get back to me. That's kind of what we're looking at too. What else would be helpful?
Christian Sheerer: No, I think it's, I mean I think the rest of it will get unearthed as we kind of roll through things and at a very high level. All of those are check marks on the boxes that you listed out. Payment link one to one, PCI compliant. We handle that. We make sure you don't have to store anybody's account routing number. You're not driving checks to the bank. One of our first, like real big customers, they were doing everything paper based. They've been around for 100 years and they mentioned to us, hey, we saved 10 hours a week not having to just drive. And then not to mention the time that it takes to be like, hey, you didn't send us a payment. Now I have to call, you have to email, you have to store your account routing number on file, etc. And so but I'm, I'm want to drill in on the one thing that's hanging over my head, which is like the QB switch, QuickBooks switch. I know, I wrote down QB switch. What, what switch were you going through it? Was it just the change in the Persona who was handling? Yeah, because this is on your end.
Ryan Jacob: Yeah, it's the same, well it's the same owner, so yeah, my father in law, mother in law owned the company. Father in law passed away, so it's owned by the mother in law.
Christian Sheerer: Sorry.
Ryan Jacob: Same bank accounts, literally nothing changed. Except for me. Ryan is now cutting checks instead of Doug and QuickBooks was going to make us shut down our payment account and then they weren't, they were going to do some Transition thing. I had to submit all sorts of paperwork to them proving that, you know, it's not fraud, including a new operating agreement, a letter that basically said that owner approved me to handle everything QuickBooks related. But we couldn't do that and actually talk to somebody. Like the people I talked to were like the low end people who didn't know what was going on. There was like a case I had to submit everything to and they just weren't understanding what was happening. And then this morning I wake up to an email with about 10 or 12 emails saying payment canceled. And when I try to go in there, I thought, oh, did something go wrong with payment? No, they said we don't qualify for bill pay anymore on our QuickBooks account. And I know I can get it sorted maybe if I spend the next day with him on the phone. But I was like, this would be a great time if we're going to make a change. Just to make it. As long as it still connects to QuickBooks. Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: You guys use online or you guys use QuickBooks online?
Ryan Jacob: Online, yeah.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, cool. So we have. Yeah, I mean the story there is, you know, we build around them too.
Ryan Jacob: Right.
Christian Sheerer: Like we are not an erp. That'd be like a much more ambitious project than what we're figuring out, which is like the payment side of things. So we link up to QuickBooks Online, we wouldn't replace them as the ERP and I don't know the number, but a large swath of our customers use online, they link back into it. It's a360 integration. So any change that gets made in nickel is going to propagate into the QuickBooks Online ERP side. Any invoice that you create on QuickBooks, they're really good at doing line items and stuff like that. You can create that invoice, it'll automatically populate into nickel and then it creates a nickel payment link that gets sent out. And we're handling all the PCI compliance, handling the storing of information on both ends of your bank account there so you don't have to send it back and forth between people. That's true of bills for vendors as well. Right. It's pretty much the same side on both. And so that's what a majority of people who are using it already come to us and say, hey, like we're getting screwed. Either whether it be support, just because QuickBooks massive, I mean Intuit, massive company, QuickBooks, that product is built to be an ERP. It's not built to be a payments architecture, but they realize they can make some revenue, you know, adding payments in and charging 1% on the ACH. That's like a, you know, really good deal flow for us. Like, you, you're pretty much, you know, in a similar boat as a lot of people. And it's kind of right within the type of business that we do, like, want to work with. Right. Is built world stuff, industrial small businesses. Like, we have a, you know, a whole host of customers who are using us, their schools or their PTAs or their whatever, homeowners. So a whole bunch of other things. But like, our idea was our founder came from Stanley, Black and Decker. The other founder built payments out for Airbnb and they knew each other and they were like, hey, there's no kind of online platform that's doing these large transactions. Right? Where industrial type transaction is a small. If it's $50,000. If you tried to run that through any other online, you know, a stripe, for example, we tried to pay Zoom via stripe. It shut us down for like three days. Right? Because it's like, oh, you need to multifactor in stripe, you need to multifactor back into your bank. Sort of a similar thing. I don't know if it's because of the transaction size, but maybe it's just, you know, a lack.
Ryan Jacob: Yeah, that's a good point. Because even QuickBooks, like, at first it would let us do ACH, but then when we tried to do a larger one, that's when everything got weird and wanted like all these verifications and things that, I mean, again, we're legitimately doing business.
Joshua Morphew: But, you know, what happened was we just turned the. I hope I'm not causing static with the. Okay, we just turned on the bill pay because he was cutting checks. And I said, huh, this is integrated, this is simple. And I think he ran a couple larger ones through and then they just started asking to speak with their contact who's now deceased. And that's kind of where it got weird. But we love automating the bill payment process and on the collect, you know, collection side, like, yeah, that would be great as well. Just kind of a bonus that they do that as well. Because we are wanting to be able to send people invoices. We do get some call ins. I mean, it's, it's a blend of retail stuff, unfortunately, small transactions, our sales, sorry, small transactions to a lot of people. But then we have, you know, the bulk of the revenue is very large utility type transactions.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, yeah. And both, both, both are handled like, yeah, we don't preclude people who are doing small amounts per transaction either. Right. The reason I go into that story is because that's really the, the founding story of nickel is like if we could build a really deep payments architecture to handle payments up to a million dollars and we could do above a million dollars per transaction, it's just like a special kind of pricing relationship that we have to work out there, then we'll be able to like grow a business pretty quickly because people in your shoes are, you know, doing that so often and they're, you know, that industry is lagged behind and just like, you know, using checks.
Ryan Jacob: Right.
Christian Sheerer: And we have a lot of people who are kind of like second generation in the business who come to us like, hey, my business is lasted, has been around for 50 years and now we're trying to modernize it, bring it to the 21st century. And that's sort of what we do.
Ryan Jacob: That's right, we are. My father in law was not comfortable with technology. I very much am. Right. And it's like to that point, like we're putting technology in place to help us scale as we're growing as a company. And this is something that I love, that I could just look at it like I even had it set up so our office administration put everything in and I could just look at it every once in a while, make sure everything was kosher. If something went over like a higher, super high amount, let's say it's over like 30 grand or 40, 50. I don't know that we could set a threshold to say, okay, Ryan needs to check that one too. But if most of them, we're just letting them push them through and then I can just keep an eye on them, make sure they got scheduled, make sure they're going on time. And that was, that's what we're looking for. I want, I want to reduce our ad or accounting load when it comes to making those payments, make it easy for my admins to be able to put that in and we can just, you know, look at it, approve it ach or check, depending on what the customer wants. And then we can figure everything else out too. But that's, I'm gonna have to start cutting paper checks again if we don't figure out something soon. So that's why I'm trying to, to remedy that first and foremost. How would you guys compare to like a bill.com? i think that's the other one I'm looking at. Oh yeah.
Christian Sheerer: I mean, I don't know if bill.com does ar at all?
Ryan Jacob: Yeah, I don't think they do.
Christian Sheerer: I think that's our. That's the main technical difference. We're also going to be free. Ach. And I don't think Bill.com does that either.
Ryan Jacob: They charge and for. Okay, so. And Josh, that's something that you think we could benefit from is tying AR to that as well. You're on mute. There we go.
Joshua Morphew: I think so. I mean that's kind of why when you brought it up earlier, I said huh? And I pardon my ignorance, but I just wasn't familiar with the platform either. And so I have a accounting practice and that's why I just said, well yeah, let's talk to them both just for this business and to kind of here. Because I do know that as a pain point, nobody typically with typical payment processors wants to take a large payment. And sometimes you end up agreeing to checks which can delay things 30 days. And you know, we'd always rather get paid sooner then with the way the business is scaling, this could open some efficiencies. So yeah, I don't see it as a bad thing at all. Brian, for what it's worth, I mean we'd love to not get checks either if we could avoid it. It's not always going to be an option though.
Ryan Jacob: I mean. And we. We found you Christian through chat GPT.
Christian Sheerer: So nice. No, no, no, I'm glad that you brought it up. I was gonna ask my marketing, our growth person. He always asks me to ask. Yeah, I do a lot of work to make sure that that like we. We come up and. And the marketing team's like really good and cutting edge and so awesome.
Ryan Jacob: Y. Yeah, they did. We put in like scenario situations what we're dealing with. And I was like, hey, I'm looking@abill.com. like who else should I look at? And it essentially was like, here's your list. And I think it actually even recommended you guys based on what it asked us we were doing. And so it's kind of selling for you a bit. But that's. I'd never heard of you. And so I literally set up an appointment this morning after I did that and you know, here we are.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. No, and. And. And so I'll take you through the. And so wait, Josh, before I hop in there, it's. Are you. Just because I noticed and you described it as running your accounting practice. Are. Are you sort of fractional to gra? And like I said, would you be interacting with the. The platform so I can tailor it that way.
Ryan Jacob: Yep.
Joshua Morphew: And I, I am. And just like I said, I think when I went to the website I noted I had in a tab for accountants and you know, I was a little bit familiar with Bill, but that was more on like the AP side like you said, so.
Ryan Jacob: Cool.
Christian Sheerer: Awesome. Yeah. And I think, I mean to round out the conversation on Bill, it's like there's, there's an immediate switch which is, or immediate kind of win is like on the fee side, on the corralling both AR and AP side. But I think the direction of being really deep on this particular niche, which is not a niche. Right. Like manufacturing and industrial businesses are huge swath of. Right. American domestic product. But that, that's like the, the things that we will build as a technology company are going to be tailored specifically to that. So I think that's like the direction is going to move in the same way that, you know, industrial businesses are moving as they move forward past 2025. So I think that's like another thing. And you know, we benefit from being a smaller team. Speaking about support.
Ryan Jacob: Right.
Christian Sheerer: Like we have American based support. So everybody that needs support will get touched by the people who are 10ft away. Well, I'm actually upstairs, but downstairs in the office with us and we can have back and forth conversation about like I can drill them down with context to them. It's, it's not 24, seven business days during, you know, nine to six, but like they're around the clock almost. Um, and, and, and we, we really try to narrow it down and get, get to everybody. Um, and we do get, I mean.
Ryan Jacob: Christian, you have the strength in the fact that you have people actually answer the phone like that. Like, like that's, it's not even like I can't even talk to somebody in India about our problems, you know, anybody, you know, it's like nobody wants to hear about it. So. Okay, well, let's, let's check out the platform.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, yeah. And so I mean the first thing that people do is just set up QuickBooks. So they come in and like you'll have a summary once I have a fake account. So there's not really anything built out, but I come in, I go. Then I just link QuickBooks straight up, map over the chart of accounts and then boom, everything's going to be like a360. Right. If I create a bill in QuickBooks and it comes in, a little QuickBooks icon will come here and then I can come in to make that payment. So it's really, you just have like two tabs open, you handle everything ERP accounting side in QuickBooks and it'll get reconciled after you make a payment or receive one in real time and nickel. And it'll also pull in as it gets created in QuickBooks in real time as well. So you just come into nickel to make payments and then you know, you go to do your, you know, balancing of the books or whatever in QuickBooks and that's where we have like that synchronicity between them. So I'll go in and I just make the payment. Pretty simply whatever payment method I want to store on file, you know, I can send them a check. It's $2 for us to like print the paper and send it. So you could do that if they're demanding it. But usually typ people opt for ACH. Or you can also pay by card, get 2.9% for everything. AP and we can offer credit card receiving as well on the AR side where people typically don't even think of that as an option. They start to offer it and make it sort of foolproof for, for their customers to offer it. I mean to, to, to opt in by paying that way and they start to see some more credit card transactions which the benefit there is a one day turnaround time and they get all the benefits of paying with their card.
Ryan Jacob: Can you limit what cards are taken? I know we're not a big fan of American Express. I mean because they, they almost do too much for their customer. We've had people, you know, we'll buy our stuff, use it and then get a charge back and there's no way to win that. So if we do something like that, do you have control over what cards are accepted?
Christian Sheerer: Not to the card level just yet. You could on a customer basis turn it off essentially if you know, you're starting to see those. But we also would be negatively if I'll tell you this, like negatively affected by a chargeback. So we will help in that kind.
Ryan Jacob: Of.
Christian Sheerer: Like we'll be involved in that. It's not to say that we have 100 foolproof like you know, nobody's ever charging back. But like that's something that we need to be involved in too because it's, you know, that's part of our business model as well.
Ryan Jacob: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, it's actually a good question too that I'll, that I'll raise to the development team about like can we, you know, block access to certain cards? Our philosophy is like if we offer it to everybody. So if I come in and I want to get paid, I'm creating an invoice and I'll request a payment for somebody. Let's see if I have. So I've already sent these, but I'm going to send a reminder and show you what it looks like on the receiver, the customer side. So let's assume that this little QuickBooks icon was there. It was created in QuickBooks. The invoice ported over to Nickel automatically and I sent it out via Nickel. I'll go in, I'll send it and then one sec. On our end or sorry, on their end they'll get this. It says reminder, but for the first time it'll be like, hey, Degrade Distribution has requested a payment for this invoice. Here's a little memo. And they'll go in and it's a secure one to one payment link. Each invoice is tied to a direct payment link. So you're not at risk of commingling funds across anything. Because we're not batch processing. You could do, you know, a collection or a send out of a bunch of invoices at one time, but it's still one to one. Each invoice tied to a particular link. And any kind of document that's created by QuickBooks like, like the actual invoice PDF would show up right here automatically because it'd get ported over and you can also add any other like sorts of attachments.
Ryan Jacob: Can we send payment a seg multiple invoices for one vendor? Can I send one ach or one check with multiple payments or does it have to be separate payments?
Christian Sheerer: One? What do you mean?
Ryan Jacob: So like let's pretend I have four invoices from one of our people's Moon Chemical, right? And so I have four separate invoices from them, but I only want to send one ach or one check. Is that possible? Or do I have to send an ach or check for every, for every bill?
Christian Sheerer: Oh no, no, no. You could send it for one. One bill at a time.
Ryan Jacob: Okay, could I combine them all into a single. So let's say I have four thousand dollar bills that came in and I want to send one payment of $4,000. Can I do that? Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: It depends on how. So how are you? Are you guys corralling them into one bill in QuickBooks and then that's no QuickBooks.
Ryan Jacob: We do them in single purchase orders so we can track trucks and things that roll in. But one of the things that we could do in QuickBooks Bill payment is if I had multiple payments for a vendor, I could Group them together and I could say, okay, yeah, pay it all at once. So for example, if, let's say I have to pay that vendor by check, not a huge deal, but now it's a 1 $2 charge instead of $8. Does that make sense?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. I got you. So you could come into your unpaid bills and pay them out individually. So you could, I mean, I guess not really. You could create a bill for. So let's say we go in here, we have an open balance of 11, 000. I could create a bill for this vendor and say it's 11,001 and paying all invoices and maybe you upload the invoices here for those four separate ones that are coming in and you've batched it that way and then I go and make that payment.
Ryan Jacob: Would that then reflect back in QuickBooks though that we pay all four or is that going to reflect a new bill that was paid?
Christian Sheerer: I think it'll reflect as a new bill is being paid.
Ryan Jacob: Right. So that would really help them. And I'm just trying to figure things out as we're doing it. So it sounds like then and it's not a big deal. I was trying to figure out how this would work, but it sounds like for this to work it's going to be a one to one payment. So it's going to be an ACH or a check for every single purchase order that comes in versus being able to combine it.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, exactly. I mean you could pay, you know, a small amount of the overall invoice multiple times against that one invoice.
Ryan Jacob: Right.
Christian Sheerer: Like that's sort of the inverse of what you're describing. So.
Ryan Jacob: Sure, yeah.
Christian Sheerer: Of 11,000.
Ryan Jacob: Yeah, yeah. We don't typically have a use case on that unless we're. Every once in a while we have somebody that wants us to put like half down to start work on like say on the building. Sure. Most of the time though, what we're doing is we're sending out payments and it just hasn't been set up individually, which if you don't charge for ach, it's not a big deal. I guess it only adds up if they're requesting check.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, I mean the way, the way you can accomplish that in terms of just like making it the same goal of the operational. I guess just quick doing it is you can come in and you can pay multiple bills at once.
Ryan Jacob: What?
Christian Sheerer: Just so I'm clear on your question, you're basically asking if we can collapse four individual bills into one. Into one individual bill.
Ryan Jacob: I'm asking if there's four individual bills from one vendor. Yeah, I can make a single payment and it would reflect on all four of those bills back in QuickBooks.
Christian Sheerer: Well, I mean, this might be the way to do it, right? You just, you'll select all those for that particular vendor, you pay the four bills if all the delivery method is going to get remembered. I just don't update my fake environment. And so then, yeah, you can schedule all those payments. So you're going to make one big, you're going to make one, one fell swoop of four separate payments, basically.
Ryan Jacob: Gotcha. Okay, that makes sense. Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah.
Ryan Jacob: Did you have a question earlier? I thought I interrupted you. No. Okay, sorry. Go ahead, Christian.
Christian Sheerer: No, I would say the only time that you would experience a charge is if you're making your delivery method of payment a check, two bucks. Right. It's literally just to cover the cost of us doing the work for you to send it out via paper. And then if you're paying via credit card for, you know, the reasons that people use credit cards, it's 2.9%, but the ACH is always going to be free.
Ryan Jacob: Gotcha. Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: And you can set up different approvals for the way that you described, right? I, I, I can set up different people. So I have requesting an approval from a manager or an administrator, and I just go into account settings. Make that super simple. Invite members as managers, administrators. I can have them be just viewers. Right. Like a member would just be a viewer. Unless, you know, you give them manager access or administrator access, you can invite them that way. And I think this is something that we'll probably continue to innovate on as like the people that we are dealing with as customers. Their teams grow and they're like sophistication of use in nickel grows as well. But this is the way it's set up now, which I think covers probably 99 of most use cases and I think the one that you described.
Ryan Jacob: Yep, that'll work. Cool.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. I mean, the, the only other thing. So it's really kind of that simple almost.
Ryan Jacob: Right.
Christian Sheerer: I guess I want to drill down on the, like you mentioned scheduling on the ar, but also on the AP side. I guess we can break it out into both. Both, like it's usually weekly payments for one project and that's split out across multiple payments for a particular product. Or walk me through that, I guess at the most average level on the.
Ryan Jacob: AP or the arch.
Christian Sheerer: Now let's do AR first. And we could do ap, I mean.
Ryan Jacob: AR just kind of comes in, Josh. I don't know if there's any trends that you've seen. Depending on. We have net 20, net 30.
Christian Sheerer: But it's one payment for one job.
Ryan Jacob: Yes, typically, I believe so.
Joshua Morphew: I believe it's not always. You definitely get checks from some vendors that pay multiple invoices.
Ryan Jacob: Okay, all right.
Joshua Morphew: Most customers. Sorry, not vendors. But you, you get paid by some of your customers for 10 invoices at once on one check for 10 orders.
Ryan Jacob: Yeah. Okay, cool.
Christian Sheerer: And that is in 10 separate invoices in QuickBooks, Josh.
Ryan Jacob: Or it is. Okay.
Joshua Morphew: And not always super easy to figure out what matches what. So would love the opportunity to turn those check payers into ach payers.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, it can always come in and like via customer. I probably have so many Christians, I don't even remember which one would have multiple.
Ryan Jacob: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: Christian 12 has multiple. So I could come in and just filter by the customer and send out, for example, those 10 invoices in one payment request. Okay. I can also set it up. So if I wanted to edit this one, you guys have 30 day terms. I can send the invoice on today and make the due date 22nd October, and then it won't be overdue until October 23rd.
Ryan Jacob: Right.
Joshua Morphew: So if I hear you correct, the invoices are created in QuickBooks still, but we create those payment requests out of nickel.
Christian Sheerer: Exactly. Yeah.
Ryan Jacob: Great.
Christian Sheerer: Yep. And if you do create an invoice in nickel, you can you just come in. That might be a good way to show just like the flow of how we handle it. And we'd say, you know, this is payment number three for job C. Upload the document for whatever you guys need from the QuickBooks side. If it's already in QuickBooks, this document will already be uploaded and sync over. And I can set up recurring or one time and I can set it into the future when I, if I want to. If I'm doing this on a, you know, monthly cadence or a weekly cadence, and I'm saying, hey, I did all the bills that we need to send out for the beginning of October and I'll send them out on October 1st and make the due date November 1st, I can do that too. And I can edit these that are coming from QuickBooks on the individual invoice level. But to not get too into the weeds, if I wanted to find all the invoices from this customer that we need to send out, I can filter for them, grab all of them, and send out the payment requests. So that would be sort of like the way we get over the scheduling situation, and then as they're active, that's just means open, unpaid, in full. You know, technically they can negotiate with you. Hey, we're going to pay two times on this invoice. We're going to pay 500 up front and then a thousand later. However you guys want to do that. If you want to split that up into different invoices, you can. But once it's paid out and completed, it'll move into completed on our. Our side as well as on the quickbook side.
Ryan Jacob: Okay. And then now this has every single. So we could also look up customers by this. Right. Based on history. Okay. Which that would be nice too, Josh. I think, because that's not something I think we have the best way to do right now. And so once we get Amazon and our E Commerce pushing to QuickBooks, this would be a really easy place to filter out those spray foam orders, at least by individual to look them up again too. So that could be. That could be handy as well. And Christian, for perspective, when I said I schedule stuff, I'm talking about paying people. Okay. So on the receivable side, that's honestly something I don't know a whole lot about. It's not something I've had to mess with as much. I think that's probably Donna, who's doing most of that on our team. And then Josh has been helping us try to create efficiency in that process. But that's great to know. These are tools here. Is there any sort of training on that? I guess if we did implement nickel, where are they? Like, there's like video resources or something that could help her make sure that she understands how that works. Because even in doing bill pay, there's definitely some frustration and a learning curve. And I want to make sure that I don't want to put more on her plate. But I like the convenience of what you're talking about doing.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, yeah. Is. You said her name is Dawn?
Ryan Jacob: Donna.
Christian Sheerer: Donna.
Ryan Jacob: Okay, cool.
Christian Sheerer: I'm just making a note because I'm gonna make a note to pass it. So, yeah, we have a customer success team who kind of sets it up in one of three ways.
Ryan Jacob: For.
Christian Sheerer: You guys are probably in the second of the three ways I'm going to describe. There are some people who get set up like super easily for those first kind of, hey, we need to run some transactions. You'd probably be in between the one and the second way that I'm going to describe the first one is like, we have like a week or like within the day pass you to Customer Success, get you activated and starting to run transactions. And that's I think everything that we've shown today. I have a recording of it, I can send it to people, but we can get you spun up really quickly. We can schedule kind of like a call to get everybody onboarded, add people as managers, administrators, get them. We can also on the same call send out a transaction and then some people just after that. First we call it a week. It's not really a week of work. It's like, you know, you do the three checkboxes of creating an account, linking your QuickBooks, linking your bank account and starting your first transaction. And you know, that happens rather quickly. And then the second one is like we have like a month long onboarding where there are probably three check in calls, roughly maybe two up to four really just to protect our, you know, customer success team's calendar where, you know, okay, you know, we have three people who are going to manipulate the system. Ryan's going to be like a high level, maybe administrator approval, Joshua's going to be in and out of it, connecting it to QuickBooks, making sure everything's moving efficiently. Donna just needs to be able to learn how to send an invoice and see where it gets posted and so her job can be checked off when she's done that and also send bills, whatever. And so then the third one is like for you know, much larger teams, not even smaller teams, sometimes even do larger revenue than those people that require the quarter long onboarding. It's like, hey, we have all these different complicated AR AP team members that need to learn all of this stuff. And so we segmented it out that way, pretty much just meet the needs of where people are at in terms of education on, on your guys's end. So I would say to diagnose or whatever. What's the word? Prescribe. There you go. Yeah, we, we could, I mean I could give you a breakdown of, in a demo video of how to set everything up, get onboarded, put your account in, start running some transactions. We can check in thereafter, troubleshoot anything that came up. If Donna wants to hop on a call, I can walk her through stuff, see that those first couple of transactions are running through smoothly and then pass you over to Customer Success where they'll kind of complete onboarding process which by that time will have completed 95% of it. But they're sort of there so that I can continue to talk to people who are interfacing with us for the first time and then they'll also set up like, you know, a monthly or a quarterly type of cadence to check in. And if we have new, new things, new features help communicate those there.
Ryan Jacob: Josh, any questions?
Joshua Morphew: No, I don't think it'd be super hard to implement.
Ryan Jacob: What's, what's our investment here, Christian?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, I mean it's always a fun part of it because I always get the response like what? It's 35amonth, really? And you know, as a salesperson, I'd be like, I, I, you know, I think It's a good deal. 35amonth for the company. If you're receiving on credit card, you can pass that on to the customer in full. 2.99%. If you want to eat some of those chargers, you can. So that it's not, it's not hidden, it's just you can configure whether you're passing or you're eating them based on. Sometimes you have a conversation with a client and they're like, hey, we won't want to pay via credit, but you know, we're giving you so much business, you got to eat it. You can Split it up 50, 50, 40, 60, 70, 30. So those are the only fees on top of the 35 that you'll experience. And also if you pay a vendor via credit card, it's 2.9%, which we.
Ryan Jacob: Don'T, we don't do. So that's fine. Or if I do, I can do directly through like their link or whatever instead of using this to avoid that charge since we do it so seldomly. Okay. Yeah, that's, I think that's good, Josh. You have any hesitations? No, let's get. What do we do to get rolling, Christian?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, I mean it's as simple as you, you go to get. I'll send you a recap of everything we chatted about. But like the short of bullet points of getting started is get nickel.com, create an account for your business. Okay, Josh, we can have a conversation if you have other clients that you think would use this.
Ryan Jacob: You.
Christian Sheerer: We also have an accountant's type account. I don't want to muddy the waters here, but like we have an accountant types account where you can have like sub clients under it. We'll say that for another conversation. But yeah, link the business details, etc. Put your bank account in, link QuickBooks and then you'll be ready to go. It'll port over all of your open QuickBooks invoices as well and bills, the closed ones. It won't port because Whatever. They're already reconciled in QuickBooks. We don't need to handle them via nickel. But yeah, the open ones and the customer information will port over right away and then, yeah, send them out. And I would say two business day turnaround time for ACH and one day business day for credit card. So typically what we do is send you off, you guys get started and then we schedule a check in whether it be a week from now or at the end of this week, whenever you think those first couple, maybe three, four, five transactions would be run through.
Ryan Jacob: Okay. Okay, well, I'm gonna get. I'm literally creating an account right now. I'm gonna do what you need to do to get that. That connected and then yeah, we'll want to know. I mean, I'd like to send payments how quickly. Once you set up an account, you think we could actually send an ACH right away? Okay, great. I'm probably even going to try to do that today if I can because I have some that are backed up now that I'm going to. So I think that would be great. And said we can cut in some checks. Cool.
Christian Sheerer: And yeah, should we get back together on Friday or next Monday?
Joshua Morphew: I would say Monday.
Ryan Jacob: Okay.
Joshua Morphew: Just so we can play with it on Friday. We could do Friday too.
Ryan Jacob: Brian.
Joshua Morphew: I'll be in their office Friday.
Ryan Jacob: So yeah, Christian, I don't know if like, if you want to do something, maybe Friday, give me ability Friday afternoon since Josh and I'll both be here.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, I do. I'm free. You guys are Central time?
Ryan Jacob: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: Is everything in Oklahoma, all your customers and stuff?
Ryan Jacob: Our customers are all over the United States, depending on what they're buying, what they're doing. Okay, cool, cool.
Christian Sheerer: I was just curious, honestly. I can do two central. I'm free from three to four eastern and I'm also free from 12 to. Sorry, what is that? Yeah, 12 to one central. So three or 12 door two.
Ryan Jacob: Oh, you said three or 2pm central. Is that what you said? Or 3pm?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, I'm free from two to three central. So two is.
Ryan Jacob: Yeah, that's. That works for us. Awesome. Cool.
Christian Sheerer: I'll send that over. Yeah, it sounds like you're you. Some people need. Need me to send them an email to say go to getnickel.com so you're past that stage, but I'm already there.
Ryan Jacob: Yeah, you're okay.
Christian Sheerer: I have a call coming up and so after that I'll recap everything for us and make sure we're just like all on the same page on mail thread. And if anything comes up, like, feel free to reach out to me. I might direct you to support if there's, like, a weird technical question. But, yeah, even before you get, you know, going, we're. We're happy to answer questions. And if we need to set up some ad hoc time before Friday, we can do it. But if not, I'll see you all on Friday.
Ryan Jacob: All right, Sounds good. Thank you. Thank you. All right.
Christian Sheerer: Thank you. Yeah, nice to meet y'.
Ryan Jacob: All.
Christian Sheerer: Have a good one.
