Deborah Enriquez: Well? Hi.
Christian Sheerer: Hey, how's it going?
Deborah Enriquez: Good. How are you?
Christian Sheerer: I'm doing well. I'm staying busy better than sitting around doing nothing. So I can't complain. How has your day been so far?
Deborah Enriquez: Honestly, it's been a shit show and I'm expecting to be interrupted by somebody's gonna come to my front door, so I'm gonna have to take a second to so if we need to regroup and reschedule, that's fine.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, up to you.
Deborah Enriquez: I mean, a bunch of things to throw at you. I'm very interested in a quick demo with Nickel. I had never heard of you guys before, so you guys need to do better with your marketing. Get out there.
Christian Sheerer: Well, you found us.
Deborah Enriquez: I found you only because I was using Forwardly and I've got a list of issues with Forwardly. And so I was like asking around and somebody just happened to mention you guys and I'm like, oh my God. So if you could show me, give me a quick demo, the ins and outs and how that works and what that looks like.
Christian Sheerer: Cool. Yeah. Well, the word of mouth working. So just so I know where we should spend a majority of our time in the platform. I have a couple questions. Like what are, I guess, I mean, what is the most pressing issue with Forward League?
Deborah Enriquez: Oh, I don't know that we have an hour, but let me run through a few things. Okay, so one, I'm gonna. I need to ask you how you verify a business. I have several clients that are virtual only, so they don't have a physical business address. It goes to, like, a PO box. So that's been a sticking point. One of the other thing is for my client of. They are, they need payment links and Fordly does not do payment links. They, and because a client that I have, they're mid-market and they're, when they send their invoices to their customers, their customers don't have a cell phone to send a verification code to. Okay. So, so that was one of the things with like Melio, with QuickBooks, you could do a payment link and they could just click the link. Put in the information and pay it from there versus having to put in the payment information, get a verification code to prove who they are and go back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. So I'm interested in that. That's been a big sticking point. I'm interested in how if for on like making a payment, say paying a bill, If one of the situations that I had with one client, she paid a bill and she's incorrect me out. So we had to worry about getting it canceled. What does that look like? Another thing is. I. For one of the clients, they got, I'm interested in recurring payments because I have a couple of clients who do recurring payments. So on a recurring payment, if it's set up for a recurring payment and the client goes, oh no, take your payment sooner than that, is there a way to skip that, do something with that? What does that look like? So those are just the ones off the top of my head. Oh, and then also for a payment to a vendor, is there a way in your system to make it billable to the client so when you pass it through, It goes over to QBO with the integration. And I guess I'm interested in how that looks as well and what that would, you know, how that works.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, awesome. Yeah, these are all the standards. And so what are the types of clients that you're typically dealing with? Do they fall into a particular niche? Do they spread across different types of businesses? And how many of them are there, do you think?
Deborah Enriquez: Well, I have all my clients are mostly creatives. So like graphic designers, web designers, product designers, stuff like that. I have a couple of offshoots from that social media marketer. Basically they're all like professional creative services that are my clients. But I also have recommended, unfortunately I recommended Forwardly to four of my clients who then started using Forwardly and it has been one issue after another. For the last two months, all I've done is been cleaning up issues. Actually that's not true. I am actually mapping, it's so bad with Forwardly, I actually have a database of the issue when it's been reported, whether or not it's been corrected, whether or not it's ongoing, the tickets that are open, stuff like that. And those have gone all the way back to March. So. So that's why I'm asking not just for my clients, I mean, not just for me, but also for a referral to my, for my clients, because again, my clients are all creatives, so they are looking for payment options for them to use, but most of them are not reoccurring payments.
Christian Sheerer: It's like one project.
Deborah Enriquez: Yeah, it's like per project. So they got to bill at different points and do different things. And it's just a matter of QuickBooks with their app change. I don't know if you're from how familiar you are with QuickBooks, but they did that huge change over with their platform. And all my clients are like, it is not friendly, it is not user friendly at all. So most of my clients are like, look, I'll create the invoices in there. And then if I could just go somewhere else to pull them through, push them out, get them paid, do messaging elsewhere for reminders and stuff, that would be better. Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: And how many? So you clear on the four or five that you've, like, referred out to that you were handling AR and AP for before. How many are you handling AR and AP for that you're thinking of kind of like porting into a new system than forwardly?
Deborah Enriquez: For right now, it's just going to be me because I'm not going to recommend any that was it was a complete shit show. I should never have done it. I should have tested it out for several months before I sent my clients over there. And so for right now, I'm just looking for me. I will not be recommending any apps until I am comfortable with the process and what that looks like and how that will go through. And then if everything functions as it should, I would be happy to recommend it to all of my clients and everybody else because I am not recommending forwardly to anybody. So. So that.
Christian Sheerer: So you're looking at it. You're so. So the immediate kind of evaluation that you're having of Nicholas for you to bill your own clients yourself.
Deborah Enriquez: Yes, starting with yes.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, awesome. And what are those payments typically look like in terms of volume a month and amount?
Deborah Enriquez: It's not that high of a volume. I have a couple on a couple of different platforms. So it'd probably be at the offset like four or five. Clients, maybe. Yeah. Honestly, I've. I. I gotta start reining things in and pulling things back. And because some of them are still in QBO, some of them are in forwardly, some of them are in anchor. I was using different platforms, so for right now, it'd probably be about four or five, and it's not that great of a. A volume. Either in amount or in the number at this point.
Christian Sheerer: Rough estimate just because it helps us clarify like sort of which version of nickel you'd be using is does it ever go above per transaction like $25,000?
Deborah Enriquez: Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Both me and my clients are all small solopreneurs and well, not solopreneurs were small S corps, but it's all micro businesses where it's typically just the owner for most of them. I gotcha. Except for my mid size client. So yeah, it would be definitely under $25,000. Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: Wonderful. Okay, cool. So I think we'll start sort of bottom up, but we'll kind of in the flow of everything kind of address all of the questions that you laid out at the outset. It's like very comprehensive oftentimes. When I'm talking to people, it's sort of like pulling teeth to try to get to understand what exactly it is they're looking for. And so we're starting off on the right foot. And I think we'll give you kind of one place that you can centralize everything. One for you to use as your practice, but also for we, you might have seen on the site already that there is a four accountants version of Nickel. It's the same Nickel, but you're able to manage those sub-accounts within that one account. Handle ARAP processes if they want to log in and see their subaccount underneath your larger one, see their individual stuff, they can. And if you want to authorize for sending out on their behalf or you send out up to a point and then they authorize actually the money going out or an invoice going out for money to come in, you can do that too. And so the first thing that people typically do is link up their QuickBooks online. So like we're not an ERP, And QuickBooks is good at that. They're not as good at doing payments, right? Because that's not their focus. I think they've realized they could earn a little bit of money doing that. And so they built it out, but that's not where they spent the majority of their time on the bottom of the tech to try to create. And that's like sort of our story is our founders came from the industrial space and Airbnb, one of them the technical founder built out the payment system for Airbnb. The other founder came from Stanley Black & Decker, developed innovative tech products for them and realized, okay, there's nobody serving this large payment type of client base, and we could do that for them. By focusing on payments, which is the lifeblood of any business, and focusing on industrial payments, which are high in the amount, sometimes high in volume, we could set up a really good architecture that sits below a pretty easy to use software. That's the 30-second understanding of it. When you come in, you link into QuickBooks. We're focused on payments. QuickBooks is a good ERP. You link your QuickBooks account. It'll open up into one second. I'll just share this tab. It'll open up into.
Deborah Enriquez: This.
Christian Sheerer: You log into QuickBooks and then you link them up there.
Deborah Enriquez: Right, right.
Christian Sheerer: And so that's going to initiate a pull back and forth. So when I go back into Nickel, excuse my like screen share back and forth, but when I go back into Nickel, I'll even see bills that are open for accounts payable processes like pulling from QuickBooks, hence the symbol.
Deborah Enriquez: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: And so that'll pull from QuickBooks, same thing for invoices, same thing for vendor information, et cetera, and you can just make that payment directly through here.
Deborah Enriquez: Oh, okay, perfect.
Christian Sheerer: Same thing on invoice side, I don't have invoices pulled from QuickBooks because this is a fake environment, but the same thing will happen, right? It'll pull in all of your active invoices too, and you don't have to send them out through Nicole yet, or it won't send them out automatically unless you toggle that feature on. But let's just imagine this one came from QuickBooks and I want to request that payment, I'll go in and I'll send a payment link out to Christian. And yeah, he's my customer. And so what he'll see on his side is in his email, he'll see that payment link come in and I'll have a new payment request and then he'll get to pay by card or via his bank account. No fees on ACH 2.99%, which is default past. To the customer on credit card.
Deborah Enriquez: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: And so you don't have to save any banking information from any of the customers. You don't have to request it from them. We'll handle that in the middle. If you wanted to pull from accounts right away, you could send them an authorization form so you don't have to send them a payment link. I can go in to here. Create a new invoice. Type in its email. Make it one time or recurring. And then I can, I can, any, any invoice document that's going to come from QuickBooks will just get pulled in here. So all that stuff, create the invoice in QuickBooks, it'll port over to Nickel. You send it out, it gets paid, then it'll get reconciled.
Deborah Enriquez: Because it's coming over from QuickBooks, when they open it, they want to look at that invoice or pull that invoice as the receipt. It is actually the invoice that was created in QuickBooks. Okay, okay. That was one of the issues that was problem with Fordly. They created some sub thing and all the background information. Was showing like a markup and all that stuff is showing and it just doesn't play well. Okay, I like that. And then on the reoccurring. On a. Reoccurring payment, how does that work? So does it wait for QuickBooks to send the invoice every month or does it just automatically pull the money every month?
Christian Sheerer: Up to you. So you can go in and if you've set up, so let's start from scratch. We can, let me see if, we're gonna send Christian another invoice. Recurring, we're gonna do it every month, every quarter, every week, every year. On some end date, we'll have the invoice or the services agreement, whatever documents you want to upload here, proof of work, all that stuff can be added. And I'm going to create it and I can charge the payment method on file if I have their payment method and I have authorization to charge them. So you can pull it on the month.
Deborah Enriquez: Okay. So. What about the invoice? So like QuickBooks has created a monthly invoice for them to have as a receipt. What does that, how does that play in with this? Is that, so for this reoccurring, will it send that, wait for that invoice and send that, or does it just pull the reoccurring payment and what do they get when it's just pulling a reoccurring payment without any information on there?
Christian Sheerer: Or whether it's been authorized, they'll get a notification if it's been authorized that the payment has been paid with the invoice connected to it.
Deborah Enriquez: Okay, okay, okay.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, and editing one is pretty simple. You can come in and just edit it. And those changes will save live on that payment link. So I changed it from 1,900, now it's 900.
Deborah Enriquez: Okay, and there's no additional authorization. Like say it was originally 900, they authorized it, and then you change the amount to 1,000, it doesn't go back out to have them authorize that different in a payment amount.
Christian Sheerer: I don't know if I'm following.
Deborah Enriquez: Okay, so you're saying that I could change the invoice. It's set up as a reoccurring payment. They've authorized it. So if I go in and I change it from $900, you've got it set up for 900. That's what they approved it at, at $900. So like six months later, we decide, okay, they're going to increase their services. Let's say it's my invoice. They're going to increase their services. They've added on something. Payroll, whatever. And so the invoice now is going to be $1,100. I go in and I change that amount before it processes a payment, will it let them know that I've changed the amount and that they would have to reauthorize that? Or is it just going to go, yeah, you've got one authorization, so it doesn't matter what the amount is. We're going to go ahead and change it.
Christian Sheerer: So without authorization, they're going to have to pay by the link every time. So they'll know if it's changed, right? With authorization, you can and set it up in such a way that, so yeah, let me do a new authorization. So like I'll set up a customer and I'll do 17, a new record today on the amount of Christians I have put into my system. And I'm going to set up a payment authorization so you could set it up so that's full permission so that.
Deborah Enriquez: Like.
Christian Sheerer: We're just going to no limits and no expiration. Or I can limit my permission to say, I'm going to do a max up to 1000, and then when I need to change that, it'll go through this process again and send a new request. So 1000 max expiration on 926, it'll send that request. And I'll get a similar type of request to my email where I'll go in and see all of those details. They'll have a nickel debriefing on our security, how we protect their information. They can cancel or revoke it. And then they can review these terms. And so if you're changing that limit or you're sending a new authorization form, That's when they'll get notified.
Deborah Enriquez: Okay, perfect. Okay. And they don't need to have an account. So like if it's a one off, like I did.
Christian Sheerer: Nobody, yeah, none of the customers need a, for any type of transaction, need a Nickel account.
Deborah Enriquez: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: They do need to put their bank account information into Nickel though, right? So that we know where to send money. But they don't need, they don't need a Nickel account. We would like them to have Nickel accounts, right?
Deborah Enriquez: Right.
Christian Sheerer: But they don't need it.
Deborah Enriquez: Okay, okay.
Christian Sheerer: That's sort of why we do a little bit more kind of educating on like what nickel is. So they know, okay, I don't have an account with this thing, but I know that it's going to be safe. They're up to the highest standard in, you know, PCI and SOC 2 compliance, and they know all their data is going to be encrypted and, you know, we're subject to like the highest regulatory standard. If you can imagine, we're moving sometimes in a payment $900,000, right? Right. And so our banks are FDIC insured. They can read up about us and do all that stuff.
Deborah Enriquez: Okay. Okay. And then so I think you've answered pretty much all the issues that I've been having. So the only other thing is like, okay, for me, what does it look like for me to set up an account? What is required? What hoops do I gotta jump through? What does that look like for me to set up an account right now?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, you just go to getnickel.com.
Deborah Enriquez: And.
Christian Sheerer: Link your bank account. So no hoops other than that really. And then if you want to connect it to your QBO chart of accounts, do that. And then you're ready. I've talked to people, I've sold software for a long time and I've been at other places. I came from a much larger company before I joined Nickel about a couple months ago. Where we would prime people to get ready to spend four weeks setting up their account. In Nicole, you could probably start to send transactions out today if you wanted.
Deborah Enriquez: Okay. And that's usually- Is there any requirement for business verification to prove who I am, like a driver's license, anything? Or is it just set up and go?
Christian Sheerer: Well, it's mostly set up and go. I mean, we do some verification. I'm not really at liberty to explain the exact kind of like, okay, that's fraud protections that we do.
Deborah Enriquez: Yeah, right. That's what I'm looking for is what kind of, what does that look like? So I'll go through the process and I'll look at it because like I said, for several of my clients, for me, it's not a big deal because even though I don't use my home office address, on anything. It's still documented here that it's here. But I know that several of my clients have a PO box or an agent registered agent who services so people can.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, that's like probably even the majority of, I don't know if it's the majority of our customers, but that's like the majority of businesses set up in the United States, right? Like, you know, everybody sets up a Wyoming business or a Delaware one.
Deborah Enriquez: Right. So just have it where they don't get so people can't find their home office. They don't want it linked to their home. So, yeah. Okay. All right. Actually, I think you've answered all my questions. I think I'll go ahead and I'll just get mine set up, start moving forward and playing with it.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, let's do this. Excuse me. So I can send you a recap of everything we chatted about.
Deborah Enriquez: Perfect.
Christian Sheerer: And try to address those questions just like in a line by line so you have them to read back into. And then do you have some invoices that you would send out like this week?
Deborah Enriquez: I don't know. I'd have to see which bounced. So probably not. Typically all my, actually, you know what? No, I don't. I have one going out on the 15th, but it's already set up as an automatic through QBO. I just would need to move that. I don't want to book my client because she's not down. So possibly not, but I could still play with it and do like a dollar to myself.
Christian Sheerer: Exactly. You could run some test ones.
Deborah Enriquez: Yeah. Yeah. So I think that's what I would be more willing to do at this point is run a couple of test ones to play with it and get to know it better.
Christian Sheerer: Awesome. And that's typically what we do is have you run some test ones. I even say like test isn't even required just because we move a lot of money. So yeah, it's just whatever you're comfortable with, plus if you had some that you could do them today. And so what we typically do is people run their first batch of transactions, whether it be those $1 tests or a couple of real ones. And then we get back together in about a week's time, two business day turnaround on ACH, one business day turnaround on credit card, and it's 35 a month. To use the service, but 14 day free trial. So we can get back together in a week once you've had time to play around with those test transactions and spend our next meeting troubleshooting any things that you came up with. If there's anything that we need to refresh, because 30 minutes I think is comprehensive, but we went pretty quick. Anything that you need to refresh or anything that you need a game plan with me and just think through, okay, this was easy to figure out, but I want to try this other scenario, let's do that. That's our typical process is like we interface for the first time and then cool people get set up and they get going and then we check in. And then by that time they're usually pretty gravy train and ready to go. And then if there's any like tech things that come up, support is really good here.
Deborah Enriquez: Okay, cool. So you're saying that to use Nickel on a monthly basis, it's $30 per month.
Christian Sheerer: 35.
Deborah Enriquez: 35. 35. Okay.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, that's for a year-long commitment. If you're just committing month to month, it's 45.
Deborah Enriquez: Oh, okay. Okay. You guys are getting up there. Melio doesn't charge that much, but I get it.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, they make their money on the ACH fees, so.
Deborah Enriquez: Right. Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: And I think there's a little bit.
Deborah Enriquez: Melio doesn't charge ACH.
Christian Sheerer: Really?
Deborah Enriquez: Yeah. They don't charge ACH. They are making their money, I think, on their credit card fees. All that may have changed, though, since they were bought out by zero. So, yeah, to be determined.
Christian Sheerer: Okay.
Deborah Enriquez: All right, then. Yeah, I'll get in and I'll play with it. Yeah, we could circle back and go from there. So do. Should we schedule something now or do you just want to reach out? No.
Christian Sheerer: You think a week from now works for you?
Deborah Enriquez: Let's do. Let's do the week of the 22nd, because I gotta. I gotta get my month ends done, and I'm running really behind with all these issues that I'm having. So maybe something on the 24th.
Christian Sheerer: Perfect. Yeah, let's do the 24th. The same time work for? I'm wide open, so you let me know whenever works for you.
Deborah Enriquez: Let's try 10 a.m. Eastern. No, Pacific.
Christian Sheerer: Pacific. Okay, one. Awesome. Yeah, I can do that.
Deborah Enriquez: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: And just because I don't have it.
Deborah Enriquez: Open, your email is deenriquez@debookkeeping.com.
Christian Sheerer: I always, I never remember if bookkeeping has two K's.
Deborah Enriquez: Yes. Two O's, two K's, two E's.
Christian Sheerer: Oh, two B's.
Deborah Enriquez: No, two.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, write it, write it. Okay, I got it.
Deborah Enriquez: Yeah, I got it. Right in a row, it goes 222.
Christian Sheerer: I thought it was like dev bookkeeping, but it's DE for Deborah Enriquez.
Deborah Enriquez: Enriquez, right?
Christian Sheerer: Got you. Okay, cool. Awesome. Okay, I'll send that over and then I'll recap what we chatted about today and kind of give you that step by step to get logged on. And then at the end of that call next time, we can also chat through if everything's going well in terms of a test. We can start to preface how you get clients baked into your accountant's account.
Deborah Enriquez: Okay, perfect. All right. Sounds good. Thanks, Christian. I appreciate it.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, no problem. Yeah, you have a great one. It was nice to meet you.
Deborah Enriquez: You too. Nice to meet you. Talk to you soon.
Christian Sheerer: See you.
Deborah Enriquez: Bye.
