Najeer Ahmed: No. Hey. Hey.
alexhoehe: Hey. Good morning or good afternoon for you guys, I guess.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, just turned.
Najeer Ahmed: Afternoon.
Christian Sheerer: How's it going?
alexhoehe: Good, Good, thank you. We. We just had. I just had a quick meeting with the CFO to. To check in on again with which account we want to connect.
Najeer Ahmed: Okay.
alexhoehe: They wanted to connect the Sweep account, but we just realized it's just getting too complicated accounting wise to. To have. It's. Well, it's simplified with the. With the main operating account.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, so you're gonna. You decided on the operating one?
Najeer Ahmed: Yeah.
alexhoehe: I tried to connect yesterday our sweep account, and Nico gave me. Or Play gave me a feedback that it couldn't find anything to connect. That's probably because we. We don't have the sweep account connected to our QuickBooks account. And I think the system checks whether it can get a feed.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, I think. Exactly. I think like Najeer was describing, that you would have to create that chart of accounts for the sweep one. So that's why it's a little bit more of a complicated workflow, because it's going to be a new chart of accounts for that in QuickBooks.
Najeer Ahmed: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: I mean, over time. I mean, also, if.
alexhoehe: If we.
Christian Sheerer: If you guys are tinkering with a way that you think it might be easier, like, we'd be happy to work through switching it as well.
alexhoehe: Right. Okay.
Najeer Ahmed: Yeah.
alexhoehe: I mean, we. We have. We have all kinds of transitioning at the moment with operating out of two. Two banks, and it would just make it very complicated. That's why we sort of think it's. It's the best way to go ahead with the main account. Okay. All right.
Najeer Ahmed: So.
alexhoehe: For us to get connected second, let me just try to connect. So in the end, we are just trying to. To connect our account right now, right? Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: Honestly, I just wanted to make sure that you were able to connect it and you found the right chart of accounts, the accounts receivable one that you mentioned, and then link those. And then if you had a couple of those. I know we kind of devised a plan to work through with the customers that you have a little bit more familiarity with sending them those links out. And we can even send them out today if you're ready to do that. But I. I can also leave you to do that as well.
alexhoehe: Yeah, I think. I think we will. We will play around with the system and. And try to understand what works best. I'm just trying to connect the 5501 account. It does say now that our. Our Sweep account is also connected. Is there a possibility to disconnect that one?
Najeer Ahmed: Yeah.
alexhoehe: Let me see. Look.
Christian Sheerer: If you can show me where you're at.
alexhoehe: Yeah, one moment. Let's go back into.
Najeer Ahmed: Oh, yeah.
alexhoehe: Just share my screen here.
Christian Sheerer: I'm gonna ask Najir to hop onto us. Okay. X out.
Najeer Ahmed: One circuit. I think you're just sharing this window so it doesn't show the pop up window that is populating already.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, I see it. I see on Plaid, Nir is in here with. With us as well. So Nadir, what they're running into is that yesterday they tried linking the sweep account, but that was a little bit too complicated of a accounting workflow. So they're going to link the operating one. But Alex, correct me if I'm wrong, you're saying that this is still the sweep trying to connect to Plaid?
alexhoehe: No, I, I could connect our main operating account or, or select the main operating account, but because I selected yesterday our sweep account, it sort of integration there already. And, and, and we do not necessarily want to have like both connected.
Najeer Ahmed: Yeah, we don't want that either. Give me one second to see if I can unlink. But we might have to link this on an incognito window or something like that.
alexhoehe: All right, I'm going to just quickly exit out of the integration payment method setup window. Okay.
Najeer Ahmed: Are you able to access. So, so right now when you're trying to connect via Plaid, it's pre. Populating the other account.
Christian Sheerer: Right.
alexhoehe: It shows that already connected accounts and it shows our sweep account.
Najeer Ahmed: Right. I think you may have to disconnect this from the Chase portal because I don't think we have access to.
alexhoehe: Oh, from the Chase account. Okay.
Najeer Ahmed: Yeah, it might be something on the side.
alexhoehe: So from. On the account settings, like I can't maybe there. I thought maybe there's some way to, to see any connected accounts, plans, billing.
Najeer Ahmed: When you, when you see it pre checked, are you able to uncheck it from within the plaid kind of pop up when you link it on?
alexhoehe: No, it wouldn't. Allow me. Let me just go back in there.
Najeer Ahmed: Are you able to check the other account.
alexhoehe: The one that we want to connect? Yes, yes, that's correct.
Najeer Ahmed: Okay, let's try doing that right now. Then we can troubleshoot disconnecting the other. The other one after to see if it kind of overwrites it. Because I think we have a setting where we only want one account linked on Plaid. So by checking the other one, you might be able to override it.
alexhoehe: Okay. Okay, so. So right now on the bottom I see it says you're already Sharing data from these accounts. And it shows our sweep account. And we basically just need to. You want me to just connect our main operating account?
Najeer Ahmed: Yeah. Okay. Yeah, so I think that you probably do. You don't have to save it, but.
alexhoehe: What is this number? This.
Najeer Ahmed: Is that the number that's attached to the Chase account?
alexhoehe: Probably. It is.
Najeer Ahmed: Yeah. This is just a plaid thing. So you can either finish without saving if you're not sure. Front test number.
alexhoehe: Okay.
Najeer Ahmed: Okay, great. So from here you want to choose actually the rating account, since that's the one we link.
alexhoehe: So that would be. That would be the Chase. I mean, our main operating account.
Najeer Ahmed: Right, Right.
alexhoehe: Okay.
Najeer Ahmed: Is it. Is it the trace checking? Is that the correct one?
alexhoehe: Yes. Okay, so this is.
Najeer Ahmed: I think you should be good to go. You can close out of that window. Just stick away from it.
alexhoehe: Just not seeing the entire window.
Najeer Ahmed: No.
alexhoehe: One second.
Najeer Ahmed: Try refreshing this page, actually. Okay. Oh, I see. We need you to finish. We need you to finish on boarding here or just some details. Yeah.
alexhoehe: All right, Let me just go out.
Najeer Ahmed: Yeah, you can stop sharing. Yeah. Yeah. Great. Yeah. So I mean, it looks like the bank account is set up correctly now and we have the chart of account correctly set as well. So you just have to go through that flow. Christian is at the finish the boarding there and they should be good to go.
alexhoehe: Okay, great.
Najeer Ahmed: I'm going to hop off for just a second, but I'm available if you need me again, guys. Thank you. Yeah, I'll ping you.
alexhoehe: Thank you. Yeah, I'll.
Najeer Ahmed: I'll.
alexhoehe: I'll go ahead and. And fill in these additional details. I would have to get some specific details from our own. Okay. And then once this is integrated.
Najeer Ahmed: We.
alexhoehe: Can basically generate the payment links and issue or basically customize the invoices that are being. Or the email that is going to be sent out with the. The QuickBooks generated invoices.
Najeer Ahmed: Is that right?
Christian Sheerer: That's correct.
alexhoehe: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: I mean, if you want to hop on later and we can run through those together, I can leave you to it also. It should be pretty simple, but if you want to double check with me and just ask any questions back and forth, we can do that.
alexhoehe: All right. What time would be good for you? I'll be. As mentioned, I'll be out between. In. In one hour for about maybe two and a half hours, maybe three hours. So it would be your afternoon at 4. 4:30.
Christian Sheerer: You're back at 4:30.
alexhoehe: I would assume you're two.
Najeer Ahmed: You.
alexhoehe: You're not three hours ahead.
Christian Sheerer: I think we're three now because when is it, when is it for you? Right now it's 10.
alexhoehe: Right now it's 10:15.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, yeah. So if you're back at 1:30 your time. I'm good, I'm good after 12 your time. So anytime after that. Okay, good.
alexhoehe: Then, then I hope we can connect around three hour time. Well that will be six your time. Maybe, maybe 2:30 earliest. 2:30. I'll try to be able to connect at 2:30. Otherwise we'll, we'll, we'll connect tomorrow. I don't know until what time you're, you're reachable.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, we, I mean I'll be wrapping up at like 6:30 my time today, so. 2:30 works. I can, I can block that off for you.
alexhoehe: Okay, let's, let's aim for 230 to 3.
Najeer Ahmed: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: Awesome.
Najeer Ahmed: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, cool.
Najeer Ahmed: We'll do it.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah.
Najeer Ahmed: Great.
Christian Sheerer: Let me know if anything pops up in the meantime too. And I'll drop my number in the thread in the case that you need to call me really quickly.
alexhoehe: Excellent.
Najeer Ahmed: Perfect.
Christian Sheerer: Thanks so much. I'll see you later.
Najeer Ahmed: Have a good time. See you later.
Christian Sheerer: Of course, you too.
