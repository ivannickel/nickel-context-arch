Colton O'Farrell: Hello. Good morning.
Brandon: Morning. Morning.
Colton O'Farrell: Are we all doing today?
Brandon: Good. Thanks. Yeah.
Colton O'Farrell: Awesome. And I know, so Brandon, Rogers is who I have on the invitation. If you, would like to do an introduction on your side and kind of roles and responsibilities, that'd be really helpful for me.
Brandon: Yep. I'm Brandon. So build it. I don't know. GED. I'm Heather.
Colton O'Farrell: Heather. Nice to meet you, Heather.
Brandon: And I'm Wayne.
Colton O'Farrell: And Wayne, pleasure to meet you all. Well, my name is Colton. I work on the sales team, here at Nickel. So, really, my role is to learn a little bit more about your business, how you discover Nickel, what got you to take this meeting. I'm happy to walk through the platform, per your use cases, and then we can wrap up with discussing whether it's a good fit, next steps, and I'll send you all the information and resources you need to be successful. But how does that sound?
Brandon: We found Nickel, by searching, trying to find a way to take payments, you know, online. So we we currently send out hard copy invoices in the mail. We get checks back. And particularly over the summer, I've noticed just kind of a lag. People are traveling, not getting their mails often, you know, payments, coming in slower, and we spend something we get to consider for a while with them acted on, you know, as you look at some of the your competitors that have, like, a 1% fee and realizing the impact that would have on revenue is a bit of interest. But then we were certainly drawn to the idea of having just pay a monthly fee. If clients wanna pay the 3% on their own to a credit card, they can't. Otherwise, free ACH transfer is really what we're here.
Colton O'Farrell: Awesome. That's extremely helpful information. So with mailing those invoices today and receiving checks from your customer, what are the typical ranges you're you're looking at kind of from a low end to, like, the highest invoice that you'd be sending to your customers?
Brandon: In dollar amounts? Dollar amount. The low end would be, you know, $500 to up to that. 100,000? Yeah. Yeah. A 100,000 a time. Like, if they miss a month or two, then it would be up to a 100,000. Yeah. So I I noticed you've got, like, a $25,000 threshold from, like, one account to the other. So we certainly wouldn't be able to go up to a 100,000.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah. Let me just explain that quick here. So I'm just gonna go ahead, share my screen with the pricing. So it sounds like we've we've done some looking at the pricing page here. So just to just to clarify that that limit. So, have you guys also created your account already with Nickel?
Brandon: We we do have an account. Yes.
Colton O'Farrell: Awesome. And then have you linked the payment method?
Brandon: Can you hear us?
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah. I can hear you. Can you hear me okay?
Brandon: Yeah. I see the phone. I have a rejectable t there. No
Colton O'Farrell: worries. You've created the account. Have you have you linked a payment method to your account yet?
Brandon: I think I linked my personal payment account so far. Just Oh, there. I think that's what we yeah. I think that's Just because I was, experimenting with what in what it looks like when you send it in. Yeah. We wanna make sure you know, one of the things we like about paper invoices that go out is they feel more better, like, and less More personal. Yeah. Personal. And so one of the thing one of the things we like about the way that we can send invoices out with Nickel is the ability to attach PDF that has the same invoice we're sending out. Absolutely. I think we have an account. I think we have a bank account linked, but it's not Cool.
Colton O'Farrell: All the only reason I asked that is because that's all you need to do in order to really activate your account and be able to start sending and receiving payments. So once that's done, you're good to go to go ahead and start trialing it out with customers if you'd like. If you wanna do a mass rollout, you're able to do that as well. Are are you y'all operating on QuickBooks online by chance?
Brandon: We all are. So that was the other piece that we have not linked anything yet, and we were hoping to maybe see a little bit of how Yeah. That integration works.
Colton O'Farrell: Absolutely. Well, the nice thing is with QuickBooks Online, it is a native integration for us. It's extremely easy. All you would do is go to account settings right here. You'd go to integrations. You'd click the the link QuickBooks account button here. This would bring you to into its QuickBooks page. You'd sign into your account, select your company, and chart of accounts. Once you do that, everything then flows in a nickel from an accounts payable perspective right here as well as an accounts receivable perspective right here. I'm gonna pop back over to the pricing quick just to explain some of that to make sure I have all questions answered. But mainly, there we really have two different pricing plans with Nickel. So we have our Nickel core plan, which is a 100% free plan. There are some limitations there, which it sounds like based on the volume that you're doing may not be a good fit. We also have the Nickel plus plan. That is our, paid subscription. You get everything on Nickel core plus some additional features. That is $45 monthly or $35 a month with an annual plan. So 20% discount there. The main difference between these plans is on the free plan, you are able to do both of the plans have unlimited free ACH. However, with the free plan, we do cap it at $25,000 per ACH transaction. So that's not cumulative. You can do a 100 of those. You just cannot do one at $26,000, essentially. So on the plus plan, we essentially remove that barrier. You are able to do up to a million dollars per ACH transaction. On the free plan, it's generally two to three day turnaround time for ACH processing. We are still in required to meet the cutoff times for our sponsor banks, which is 4PM Eastern Standard Time. But on that plus plan, we speed up that a little bit. So it's either same day to two day turnaround times so long as you meet that, cutoff time of the banks. You on the Nickel core plan, you cannot do scheduling or recurring payments. On the free plan, you're able to do that on the plus plan. Are there any customers that you're working with on an ongoing base basis where you're doing recurring, invoices for them, like a retainer or just any kind of
Brandon: No. It would vary month by month per call.
Colton O'Farrell: It's mostly one time engagements?
Brandon: Well, usually, what we're doing is we're sending maybe monthly invoices for six to twelve months, but each one's different. It has different so we're not looking to automate any of the payment.
Colton O'Farrell: Okay. Yeah. I just wanted to ask because I know there are some businesses where the recurring element's really a a big part of their business or, you know, the the scheduling payments in advance is important. Based on, like, the the $100,000 limit, I would recommend, or the the higher point of some of those invoices that you're sending. The the plus plan would would meet those needs. But if you wanted to test it out on Nickel core first with those smaller customers, send that out, see see how they like working with the platform, you're able to do that. And then actually within the platform, you're able to self serve. So if you need to upgrade your plan from Nickel core to plus, you can do that right in the plan. We give all customers a fourteen day free trial of the plan so you can see, if you like it, if it meets your needs, and if not, you're able to revert back to that free plan if you'd like. Something I wanted to ask today is are you doing any kind of credit card acceptance from your customers, or where where are you at with that?
Brandon: No. We're not we're not currently accepting from the policy.
Colton O'Farrell: Is it because you haven't had a good way to deal with the the charge that's included with that?
Brandon: Basically. Yeah. So we're you know, we'd be open to allowing clients to pay with a credit card as long as they pay it fee. So it seems like that's enough.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah. So that's, you know, exactly why I asked that. So with Nickel, we we essentially, when we send a we'll send a secured payment link with of the invoice to either, your customer via email or via SMS. When they click that link, they will get the option to pay for that, via ACH with no fees. Or if they're looking for credit card points, a forty day float, they can pay via credit card. There is a 2.99% fee there. However, with Nickel, automatically, it's set up that a 100% of that surcharge will be paid for by your customer. This is the global rule that you can find here in settings. If for whatever reason though you wanted to adjust this where you were paying, let's say, $50.50, you could do that. $25.07 oops. $25.75. Or if you wanted to fully eat the cost, you do have that control there. I'd say most of our customers keep it at the default level here. But once you have once you have that connection and integration with QuickBooks online, like I mentioned, everything flows into here. I'm doing a ton of demos all the time. So I've sent out most of the invoices that I've pulled in or or created. But what what it would look like is all those invoices would come in here. You just go to the far right hand side where it says payment request. It would say request payment. You just click that to send it off as via email or SMS. I'll just open this previous one I've sent to show you what that looks like. If you're integrated with QuickBooks online, all invoices and attachments will automatically auto populate into this field here, so you don't need to worry about that. This is the secured payment link that your customer will receive. So they can either receive that via email or via SMS. Also, an an additional, perk on Plus is we can actually set up a payment authorization request from your customers. So if this customer has approved you to, to pull from their account, there's typically, transaction limit, expiration date, or there could be no limit, no expiration date. Just depends on the agreement you have with the customer. But if you have that set up and they've authorized, we'll we'll actually be able just to pull from your customer's account without even having to, request the invoice since they've given that pre authorization. So that's what this charge payment on file method is here. If But you were just to send this off via email or SMS to your customer, I'll pop over to show you what that looks like. So your customer will receive an email that looks just like this. So it will say your company and name, the the logo and branding there can just be modified within settings right here. So you can add your logo, your branding. Your customer will receive that email that looks like this. It will have the payment amount, the invoice name or number, a memo if you've added that, and then the invoice will actually be attached right there for them. If they reply to this email, you'll be cc'd on any communication just like this. And when they hit this pay now option, this is the secured payment link, which is gonna get them the option to either pay via a credit card for that 2.99% fee or, pay it for free with their bank, or for no fee just via ACH. So that's a previous one I've sent. But if you are looking to, create invoices directly within Nickel, you can also do that. Just go to new invoice here or recurring. Go ahead. Select your customer. We also have some advanced features that we can toggle on or off. So if I go here, if for whatever reason we wanted to disable credit card payments on this invoice, you could turn that on. If you wanted the the customer to be able to edit the payment amount, you could turn that on. Or if we wanted to override the global credit card surcharge management rule of a 100% of your customer paying that, if for this particular invoicing customer, we agreed to pay, half, we could set that up right there, and that would actually override the rule. So I'll just do that as an example. We'll do an invoice like this here. I will have this be for let's have this be for $20,000. One time, put a memo here. Hi, Colton. Please make the payment ASAP. And then like I mentioned, if it is connected to QuickBooks online, you won't have to worry about attaching any invoices. But if we're generating one ourself, we can just add it like so. I'm gonna go ahead and hit create right here. There's that secured payment link again. If I wanted to open this up in another tab and see what this looked like prior to sending it to my customer, I could do that. You'll actually see the change there of the 1.47% versus the 2.99% by default because we adjusted that rate. But once I hit the send link button, it's gonna automatically be sent to the customer, and it's will be sent in just a moment here. While that's sending, something else that a lot of our customers find a lot of value in. So in addition to the secured payment links that are tied on an individual invoice level. And the reason we do that is so that we don't have potential for well, one, the encryption and and tokenization, protect you and your customers. But when we do that, even if you're processing let's say we were to send all of these invoices out at one time, even if they were all to be paid, received on the same day, we are processing each one of these invoices as their own atomic unit. So we'll process it immediately. We're not waiting for them to do it in batches. But when we do that as well, we're ensuring that we have one to one reconciliation between you, your customers, and the banks. So there's no potential for any mix up or crossover there. But that invoice has been sent. So I'm just gonna go right here. Again, there's that invoice we just created just to show you again how simple and easy if you wanted to create it from Nickel. However, you're not required to. If you wanted to, fully and only create invoices from QuickBooks online, you could do that. And we actually have some automations that you could turn on. So in this integrations tab, I don't actually have this link to my like, a QuickBooks account here. But if you did, there's a little toggle automation that would pop up here in the bottom that would have it. So anytime an invoice is generated from QuickBooks online, it is just automatically sent to your customer via Nickel, and it's either sent via email or via, SMS. And when your customer pays that, especially if you're doing the ACH, there's gonna be no fees versus if you sent that through QuickBooks, you know, there's the 1% charge there. The the one time it's not good to do that automation is if you are generating an invoice and then Heather has to go in there and make some adjustments, Or there's multiple people that have to touch that and modify that invoice because each time you would change anything on that, your customer's gonna get an additional, email for any of those changes. But if you're just creating an invoice one time and it's good to send, you can turn on that automation and your customer would just automatically receive that via Nickel, and they would just go through that, pay now option to, complete that. But, in addition to the secured payment link, we also set up every company with their own merchant payment link, which kind of works as a one stop shop for your customers to make a payment or as a backup option. Most of our customers will actually embed it in their own website, and you can customize it, change it to be more reflective of your company. If you're on a plus membership, we can actually change the domain as well. But it's, just found right here. It's payment portal option right there. We can make this have a custom domain for you as well on the plus account. It is you you can take this and embed it on your own website on the free account. We just cannot change the domain without, Plus subscription. But, essentially, what this is is just like I said, a one stop shop for a customer to make a payment. You could, have this service as backup option if your primary method's not working, but it just has that, 2.99% fee for a credit card there or no fee if they wanted to pay via ACH. But I'll pause there. That's a lot of the workflows and kinda walking through that. What questions do we have with this? Is there anything in particular I can, show you or drill in deeper on?
Brandon: To create the invoices, we can either use Nickel to create them initially, or we can use QuickBooks to create them and it sends it to Nickel.
Colton O'Farrell: Exactly. Yep. And in in that event so I'll find an old invoice here that I've sent, previously or had not sent yet, but was generated. I can find what I'm sending. So it would look like this. So it would say request a payment option. You'd click on that, and, it would just pop up the email, phone number. You can change any of the settings again on there. If you wanted to adjust the invoice amount, you'd be able to do that within here as well. But because that's not over
Brandon: By the way, if we Nickel to create it originally, I think that's the way we would do. We wouldn't use Nickel to create it, then it would it would then send it to quick.
Colton O'Farrell: Exactly. Yep. Everything that's done in Nickel will automatically populate in, QuickBooks online. And same there, QuickBooks online, that info is gonna sync automatically to Nickel. I'm happy to touch on too. So and while we're thinking of other questions, I'm happy to touch on some of our security, and data protection elements as I know that's a huge piece for a lot of our customers. But, essentially, Nickel is SOC two compliant, so all of you and your customers' information is protected. Your customers don't have to create an account with Nickel. If they wanted to, they're more than able to do that. Anytime there's if your customer is paying via a credit card so for example, if they were to pay with the credit card here and there's that 1.47% fee, so obviously that changes the amount and you're only interested in that $20,000. We handle all the PCI compliance, so you're only ever getting the net amount and you won't have to worry about any fees or compliance there. Again, we use encryption and tokenization in those secured payment links so your, customer's information is protected. We are simply the processor. So we're taking money from your customer, getting it into your account, but we are never, like, taking ownership of that money. It is always your money. It is always moved through, federally insured or FDIC insured accounts. So we have bank level security, built in fraud protection, all the requirements that you would you would have for working with your customers. Any questions with any of the security or data protection information?
Brandon: Cool. So It's gonna go to the client. We're gonna see an invoice that we created in the call. It's gonna come in with the email from us. Well, or it comes from the email. We need to copy that link into the field mail that comes from us or we can where Nickel send it directly where where it comes from this Nickel email address.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah. So we have a receipts at Nickel payments. You can have your name, and, obviously, you will have your company and everything tied there. We just have to have it come from that email address so that it's it's in terms of, like, deliverability rates. So we have really good deliverability rates with this as we have over 10,000 different customers who are using us from an accounts payable, accounts receivable, or both sides of those businesses. So it will have to be sent from this receipts@nickelpayments.com address, but it will have your company name, your logo, your name, email address. And, again, you'll be cc'd on any communication there.
Brandon: How often do you find that that email is sent to someone's junk
Colton O'Farrell: How often would what was the question?
Brandon: How would you find that those emails get sent to someone's junk form? You know, is that a common problem?
Colton O'Farrell: No. Not at all. With the amount of emails that we're sending and with the amount of customers we have, it is always ending up in their inbox. One other thing so I I know we are running up on time here, so I wanna be respectful of your times. But I just wanna show you quickly showing, setting up a new customer or new vendor. So the nice thing to point out with Nickel is the accounts receivable and the accounts payable side, they function the exact same. So if you have bills that you wanna pay, you just come in here to make a payment. The the rate for the accounts payable side for credit cards as well is a little bit less. So instead of 2.99, it's 2.9%. So there's a little bit of a discount there, but you could create bills in here. If you were to set up a new customer, you just go to customers here. If they're in QuickBooks online, we'll automatically bring them over, so you won't have to worry about that. But if you were setting up a customer within Nickel for the first time, you just go to customer here, you type in their name, and then, you could set up a payment authorization. So this is what I mentioned earlier, which would allow you to automatically pull from their account. What that looks like on the customer side is they would see this email here. So it's a payment authorization request from your company. You could put a memo or notice in here. We have some frequently asked questions with answers as well. But if that was all too long and they didn't read that, we do have it on the next page here. So, again, this is just letting them know, some of the information I shared with you are stock compliance, bank level security, built in fraud protection. This is letting them know that this authorization will allow, you guys to pull from their account at any point. This authorization can be changed or revoked, but they would just go ahead and get started. If there was a transaction limit, say, like, $25,000 for a year, those things would be in here. Just because this is a sample, we don't have any limits there. They would just hit next step, how they wanna make that payment, whether by card or by, bank, review, and simply authorize, and you'd be able to pull from their account at any point. On the vendor side, so setting up a new vendor, if you had, some accounts payable that you were looking to do, it just go to you go to vendor here, new vendor. If we had if you have their information, you can enter it. If not, we can actually send them a form to fill out. What it looks like on their end is it says that your company wants to send you money via Nickel. There's those frequently asked questions with answers. They just go to fill out vendor details form here. Again, those same questions. They would say whether they're a business, corporation, individual, contractor, how they would like to receive payments. So delivery via ACH, where we can also do delivery via check for them. They would just confirm payment details, review, submit, and they'd be set up as a vendor for you to work with. But that's the majority of what I was looking to show you today. I know we're running up on time here. You've done a great job with creating your account, linking the payment method. You're really you're able to start sending and receiving payments within Nickel, but curious to get your overall kind of thoughts on what we've walked through here. I will be sending a a recap video, so I have a recording of all these workflows we covered. I'll share the security and data protection as well as the pricing page. But just curious kinda overall thoughts. Is this looking like a solution that's gonna meet our needs?
Brandon: Hey, boss. Yep. Yeah. I think we've been intrigued for a while about the idea of being able to take payments digitally, and so it looks like a pretty good fit. And the ability the ability to attach the invoice is really nice. So we need we don't have to change the way that we're creating invoices. We need get them manually the way we've been doing it and then upload that in.
Colton O'Farrell: Absolutely. And something else I'll do is I'll I'll share too. I'm not sure. Are you familiar with, g two, the online review site? It's a it's really popular in kind of the software world, but it's one of the most accredited online review sites. I'll also link Nickel's page there just so you can see from our customer's perspective. But as you'll know, like I mentioned, we provide a 100% free ACH. There is zero hidden fees with Nickel. We are one of, if not the only company who does that from this perspective, and our customers absolutely love us for it. You'll see a lot of those reviews online there. But I'll link all of that so that you're able to review everything that you need. Really, my goal is to equip you with all the information and resources you need to be successful and to operate your Nickel account per your use cases and what is relevant to to your business. So I will provide all of that for you. But if you have any questions, you're able to, communicate with me, reach out via phone or email. We also have, built in, like, support and chat functionality within the app. So if you, send, like, a message in there, it's automatically gonna be signed to our teams, and they'll reach out. We have you'll notice in the reviews that we have really exceptional, customer support, and it's easy to talk to a human. So I know we're over time here. I'm sure we have some, busy schedules. Is there anything else kinda last second questions I can answer for you?
Brandon: You did well. Well,
Colton O'Farrell: you very much. Well, I'll be shooting that email to you. If anything does come up, you let me know. Otherwise, we're really excited to be working with you, and hopefully, Nickel can help solve a lot of these challenges with ACH processing and, you know, the the receiving of checks and just having that improved cash flow on your end.
Brandon: Thank you so much.
Colton O'Farrell: Have a wonderful day. Appreciate you all. Bye bye.
