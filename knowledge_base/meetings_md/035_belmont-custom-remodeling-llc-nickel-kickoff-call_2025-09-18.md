Clinton: Okay, Colton, did you, so how did you send that invite?
Colton O'Farrell: So I sent it just via Google Calendar. Let me just shoot it to like the, Access link to your email directly if it didn't come through billing@belmont.pro Perfect. Should be a one-click button to join the meeting. I don't think it'll ask you for a passcode, but if it does, there is a passcode there for you to copy and paste. Cool.
Clinton: Looks like.
Colton O'Farrell: All right, I see on this end. Are you hearing me on both? I'll mute my phone quick. Can you hear me okay, Clinton? Cool. Awesome. Looks like you just need to unmute yourself, bottom left.
Clinton: Okay, good.
Colton O'Farrell: Perfect. Awesome. Well, thanks so much, Colton. Really glad we could make time here with the short notice. Wanted to jump on the video call here. One, just introduce myself quick. Colton, I'm your Customer Success Manager here at Nickel. My primary role is to really onboard you, get you trained up, make sure the integration's looking good, and just really to provide you with resources so that you can use Nickel given your use cases. I wanted to learn a little bit more about your business. I've done some research into the website. I know that you came in from Dan Gizzi at Cyber Global North Carolina. He's actually one of my customers brought in a while back. Curious kind of how you know Dan, but we'd love to just learn a little bit more about your business and what you're looking for with Nickel. I've also checked into your account as well.
Clinton: Okay. And you know, I did this once before with one of your cohorts earlier this morning, right?
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah. So this is separate. That was with our, it was probably with Calum. Or will?
Clinton: It was, I think it was will.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah.
Clinton: So Belmont custom roof. So I have a couple of entities. I have Belmont custom remodeling, Belmont roofing and remodeling. So Belmont custom remodeling is like our website. You know, Belmont roofing and remodeling is one of my LLCs that I do the banking under. Basically we do roofing and remodeling for residential. I don't do new construction rarely. I don't do commercial, pretty much primarily residential. Our target market is the retirement communities. So our client base primarily.
Colton O'Farrell: Like this.
Clinton: Time of year, they can be all over. They might be in Minnesota, they might be back east, they might be in South Dakota, North Dakota, Tony, you're listening.
Colton O'Farrell: I live in Chicago now, but I'm from South Dakota. I lived in Minneapolis for seven years. So talking about all my local spots I was in. So that's cool.
Clinton: Yeah. So they have second homes here. They're here in the wintertime. I'm in East Mesa primarily.
Colton O'Farrell: Snowbirds.
Clinton: We do cover quite a bit of the Phoenix market. How I know Dan is I also just recently purchased a a franchise called Cyber Global Phoenix. So I just finished that training. So we haven't officially launched yet. We will be here within the next 30 days. I'll be setting up in an account. We'll be setting up Nickel as well for that entity. That's a great idea. Yep. I think I saw you on.
Colton O'Farrell: Maybe we connected on LinkedIn too, because definitely it's all connected. You have like a cowboy hat in your LinkedIn picture or something. Correct. That's me. Awesome. Well, it's great to meet you, Clinton. Are you set up as a business owner or as an accounting slash holding company when you signed up?
Clinton: I'm an owner. Yeah.
Colton O'Farrell: So it sounds like you're wanting these multiple entities that will to be rolled up all under Nickel. Is that kind of what we're looking for?
Clinton: Well, as of like right now, I just have it set up under Belmont. But I'll have a separate set of books for Cyber Global. That will be a separate account, separate entity, separate LLC, all of That's all a separate set of books, separate entity. So it would have nothing will interlink, nothing will interchange, it'll all be completely separate.
Colton O'Farrell: We'll keep Cyber Global and we'll keep Belmont completely separate. But within Belmont, did you want to have Belmont Custom Remodeling LLC as the holding main company and then underneath that you can toggle between the roofing division? Okay. Cool.
Clinton: Just one's fine.
Colton O'Farrell: Cool. That sounds good. You want to do me a favor and log into your Nickel account and go ahead and hit the green share button at the bottom of the Zoom meeting. Kind of walk you through some things I noticed in your account that we'll want to get squared away.
Clinton: Okay. Let'S see.
Colton O'Farrell: And so your division for Cyber Global.
Clinton: Okay, so let's see. So do I do that? Okay. Okay, I'm signed in. Yeah, I'm in.
Colton O'Farrell: Cool. So then you'll go on the Zoom meeting itself. So on this, just go to the bottom of the page, there's that green Share button, click that and then share the browser or window that you have the Nickel platform on. Where is that? So it's going to be out, so you're probably looking at the Nickel page. It's not going to be on there. It's going to be on the Zoom workplace is what it says. And then with this, where you can see me on the screen, there's a green share button at the bottom. It's similar to where you unmuted yourself, but just more in the middle.
Clinton: Where did you go?
Colton O'Farrell: No worries. It disappears sometimes. I know it goes to.
Clinton: Where did I send you?
Colton O'Farrell: No worries. We'll figure it out. It happens to me all the time too.
Clinton: Where did that go? Oh, okay.
Colton O'Farrell: There it is.
Clinton: Oh, right there.
Colton O'Farrell: Perfect. Awesome. And then, yep, I can see your screen now if you just want to navigate to the Nickel tab. Awesome. I can see your screen. This is great. Perfect. All right, so some things that I noticed when I logged in your account. So you created your account, linked your bank account, you met with our compliance regulatory team, so that's great. Did everything that we need there. What we're going to have you do is go into the account settings right here. Sees your screen. It looks like it might have froze for a moment. There we go. And then account settings right here.
Clinton: Oh, what happened?
Colton O'Farrell: Try just hitting this box right there and then I'll see if there's an option to make my little box disappear.
Clinton: I don't know, it's like 20 layers deep.
Colton O'Farrell: It's kind of a matrix looking situation or something.
Clinton: How do I fix that?
Colton O'Farrell: Click this Nickel tab here first. And then just hit this X button right there. Perfect. Okay, cool. So we'll log into your account settings then, click that. So we have both on this page right here. So if you scroll down just a little bit, this is we'll need to add your branding, so your logo in here, also this banner, This is gonna be related to an accounts receivable merchant portal that you have. So you're connected with QuickBooks. Every time you create an invoice, you'll wanna make sure you save that invoice. Don't hit the review and send button because every time you save it, the way that you have it set up now, Nickel is just gonna automatically send that invoice to your customer to be paid. We'll send it primarily via email, unless you would like it to be sent as a text message. They'll receive an email that says, Belmont Custom Home Remodeling has a invoice for you. Click this pay now button. They'll be prompted to pay either via ACH, no fees on that for you or for your customers ever. Or if they want to pay with the credit card, they do have that option. There's just a 2.99% fee that the customer will pay, and you do have full control over how that fee is divided up. So by default, they pay for it fully, but if you want to change those rules or Do it on a per customer level, you can also do that.
Clinton: Okay, so this logo, can you tweak that? How does that work here?
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, so it really only accepts Square for the branding. I would maybe add this Belmont Custom Remodeling LLC as your banner. I think it should fit well for that. If you need help with getting your actual branded logo in there, I can help with that. Typically, ChatGPT honestly can really do it a lot. You say, Hey, I want you to make this image. More of a square or something and it can get it more right size for you. But yeah, that should look good for your banner at least and we'll just drag the and just the four corners, the black marks on the two ones on the top if you want to just grab them and increase it to cover the top part of the Belmont custom.
Clinton: Yeah. Let's see.
Colton O'Farrell: Okay, so it's just really increasing it. Interesting. I'll help if you want to send these to me as an email, I can get these right size for you and we'll get them uploaded.
Clinton: All right.
Colton O'Farrell: But why it's important, so you can click out of it. Why it's important is if you go to this Get Paid tab right here, and click this payments portal button.
Clinton: Which one?
Colton O'Farrell: The purple payments portal button. It is right there.
Clinton: I can't see your mouse.
Colton O'Farrell: Oh, sorry. Can you see my annotation? I'm drawing on the screen. There's an arrow.
Clinton: I don't see it.
Colton O'Farrell: In the middle of the page where it says invoices, start accepting payments by creating an invoice, click that purple payments portal button.
Clinton: Right there.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep. This is what it looks like right now. When you add that banner, you add your square logo, that will all come and replace this. Most customers use it as either a backup method or just a one-stop shop to receive payments. You can take this link right here. That's in the search bar there. You can embed that in your website if you'd like for customers just to come in and make any kind of payment. So if you type in in the box for enter a payment amount, just put a dollar for the reason you can just say test and then click make payment. I'll show you the options that your customers will see with this payment portal. Or yeah, whatever amount you want to put, just type test or demo or anything. Hit the make payment. So your customer will be prompted with this screen. If they want to pay with their bank via ACH, there's no fee. It's completely for free. If they want to pay with the card, they can do that as well. You will only get the net amount, so you will get the 125. Nickel would get the 2.99% as the surcharge fee, but again, the customer is paying that completely. This portal is not tied to an individual invoice. Customers can list the invoice number or reason. But this essentially is more of a one stop shop for you. Question, Clinton, for your, are you ever like showing up to, can you kind of explain to me how some of your accounts receivable is working today? Because there might be something that we could do with this portal that might be of interest to you, but would love to know with how your customer payment process is working today.
Clinton: Well, most of the time I just show up and they write me a check.
Colton O'Farrell: Write you a check and get it in person?
Clinton: Yeah, but like right now, like this time of year, quite a few of my customers are gone. We're still doing work and I have to take progress payments.
Colton O'Farrell: I gotcha.
Clinton: So like this morning, so like for an example, yesterday I had, you know, I needed to take a progress payment, the customers in Maine. So I invoiced him for $15,500. Well, you know, he tried to do it. We couldn't get it to work. So His daughter-in-law just wrote me a check last night and they transferred the funds and we took care of it locally.
Colton O'Farrell: That was, you were trying to initiate it through Nickel and he wasn't able to get it figured out. Yeah.
Clinton: And so then, so then there was another one that I, you know, processed yesterday. We sent it to Barbara Schweiger, the amount, we needed to change the amount because there was a miscommunication on a couple of items. So she was reimbursing me for some material that I purchased or needed to purchase. So like this morning there was one that we did with Barbara Schweiger and she ended up having to actually call in. She couldn't get it to work. I was calling or they called her to verify. I don't know. Anyway, she said it was kind of a pain.
Colton O'Farrell: So we have set up easy for them. So this might be really applicable to you. If you want to copy the link in the browser there, just copy that. And then open up a new tab and type in QR.io and then IO and then hit enter. Go ahead and paste that link right in this box there.
Clinton: Right here.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep. And you can see this QR code that's going to be generated here. If you were to take out your phone and scan this, it's going to take you directly to that portal. You'd be able to type in an amount, list a reason, pay with your bank via ACH, no fee, be able to, or they could pay with a credit card if they'd like. This is helpful for some of our customers. A lot of times guys will just have, like they will, Create an account with QR.io here so that they can save the QR code, download it, they'll have it on their phone, they'll show the homeowner, homeowner scans it and they can make a payment immediately rather than just writing a check. Most people do prefer that kind of electronic method tends to be more secure. Obviously, this is just a potential option for you. I do know you have your QuickBooks connected, so just wanted to call this out as some of our customers, particularly kind of in your industry, have found this to be helpful. So wanted to introduce you to the concept. But otherwise, if you want to go back to the Nickel Circleback, I would.
Clinton: Probably see this being more applicable with my client base when I have Cyber Global up and running.
Colton O'Farrell: Okay. Yeah, absolutely.
Clinton: With my client base, with my remodeling, they're a very, very senior, somewhat anti-technology community with my Sure. You know, 70 plus community may not be as tech savvy and as open. So, you know, they're kind of more of the old fashioned, write me a check, because that's what they're used to. I gotcha.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, no worries with that, Colton. That makes sense. We hear that all the time. Question, are you doing any debit authorization from with customers? None of that today? No. Okay. No worries. Just was curious of that. Let's go back to the Nickel platform here, because I do want to call something out. So if you just click that tab. So let's go back to account settings and then go to integrations on the right there. So you currently have your QuickBooks account connected. Wanted to call out this bottom link that says automated payment links. So I want to explain how this works because you might want it turned off, you might want it turned on, just depends on your business. But what this does is you're generating your invoices in QuickBooks Online. When you're creating that, you're generally hitting, are you saving those invoices? Are you hitting the Review and Send button? Well.
Clinton: I used to just hit Review and Send. Now I hit Save.
Colton O'Farrell: So with Nickel, with this connection, you never want to hit the Review and Send button. You're always going to want to save your invoices. What this does, so if you have this toggled on, when you hit save invoice within QuickBooks Online, with this automation turned on, we will just automatically send that to your customer invoice to pay that. So for example, if you generate an invoice and you have this turned on, but you need to go back there and make edits, change the amount, like you mentioned from this previous example, your customer would get an email each time there was a change made to that invoice. So if you don't want that to occur, if you're having to change invoices pretty regularly, I would recommend turning this off. If you have this off, the way that it would work is we're still going to grab once you hit save invoice in QuickBooks Online, we'll grab that, we'll pull it into Nickel, but you'll want to go to this get paid tab on the left side now.
Clinton: And.
Colton O'Farrell: You would go to send. So you hit save in QuickBooks Online. We're grabbing that invoice to send it off. You would go to this button here where it says request payment and you would click that. It's going to ask you, do you want to send this via email? Do you want to send this or as a text message? And then we will send the so you can click this. It won't actually send until we hit the next button, but we'll just click that for now. If you were to hit this send link, that's when it gets sent to your customer. But go ahead and copy this link right here and open and put it into a new tab.
Clinton: This one?
Colton O'Farrell: Yep. And then just open up a new tab for me and paste it in there and enter. This is what your customer will receive. So they'll get an email that says, here's the invoice, here's the amount. We are obviously pulling that in from QuickBooks Online right there. But there'll be a big pay now button when they click it. This is the screen that they'll be brought to. They'll see that they can pay for that with their bank, no fee, or if they want to pay with the card, again, they will pay for the 2.99% fee. You will get the 3.75, Nickel would get the difference. But again, we handle all the PCI compliance. You mentioned having a customer in Maine. Maine has some pretty crazy restrictions and requirements when it comes to card payments. We are compliant with all of those. So that's one aspect that a lot of customers really like. With Nickel, but this is essentially the flow you'd have. So you'd save that in QuickBooks Online, you'd come into Nickel, you'd hit request payment, and you'd send that off to your customer.
Clinton: So what if, so like, so like I do some business with like some HOAs and some property management companies, I would still have the option though, if I had that unclick, that I could go ahead and send them the invoice out of QuickBooks and it wouldn't affect It would go into Nickel, but it would just go into Nickel and wouldn't be sent from Nickel Automatic, right?
Colton O'Farrell: Yes, that's correct. I want to say, is there a.
Clinton: Reason you would want to send that from QuickBooks? Well, again, they're not going to auto pay.
Colton O'Farrell: They're not going to pay.
Clinton: Okay, they won't pay, so you won't be charged like the 1% fee. Yeah, they're not going to pay from the bank. They're not going to pay from the credit card. They're going to write me a check. Yep, that makes sense. That's just the way they're going to do it. They're not going to run it through Nickel. They're just going to write
Colton O'Farrell: me. It's going to go through their approval process and they're going to write it through their accounting department and mail a check. Yep, that makes sense. So what we do in that situation, so you do exactly what you just said, but pop back into the Nickel, the main Nickel platform for me. And then click, just click anywhere outside of this box here. You can click the X, click into one of those invoices.
Clinton: So like for instance, Apple, this is one of them. So this is, they're not going to pay it through Nickel. They're going to just, they're going to just approve the invoice their normal because that's already been sent through QuickBooks. They're just going to approve it their.
Colton O'Farrell: Normal way and write and mail a check. Yep, perfect. So what you do in this scenario then is you would simply, once they write you the check, you've got it, you just hit this Mark as Paid button and it would say paid outside of Nickel. Right. And it looks like, did we set you up? Are you on the Nickel Core, the free plan or are you on the Nickel Plus plan? I'm on the free plan. You're on the free plan? Okay, because I did want to call out, you see the settings box here? We do give some additional features for the Nickel plus plan. So if you scroll up on this page, it could, yep, and then just hit this settings box here. Not sure if you'll be able to see it all since you're on the free plan, but if you are able to, we have some different, so there would be additional boxes here for you, but basically what this does is the top one allow customers to edit the payment amount. This is to allow customers to make a partial payment. If you want customers to be able to have that option, you just turn it on for this. Oh, I'm sorry. Yes, that is the top button. This would allow for the partial payments. The one below that, if you turn that on just for a moment, and it's not going to impact anything because it hasn't been sent, this is how you would override your global rules or the global surcharge settings. If you wanted this individual invoice to be split the fee, you would change that percentage there. Otherwise it's going to be the default.
Clinton: Yeah, I remember Dan talking about that. Okay. Right.
Colton O'Farrell: Cool. Let's see. So I think I showed you a lot of it. Wanted to talk about in terms of, so you mentioned there's some of the older folks that you're working with, there's going to be more checks. In terms of accounts receivable revenue process through Nickel, what are you anticipating running through Nickel in terms of accounts receivable.
Clinton: And then accounts payable? It honestly depends on the time of year, frankly. Most of my people over the next 30 days are going to start coming back, so it will be minimal. Then when we start moving back into March, April, May, then that would probably ramp back up. Over the summer months, it would be higher. So it's going to ebb and flow, during the summer months, it could be $30,000 to $50,000 a month, during the winter months, fairly minimal, frankly, because for the most part, most of them are going to be local and going to be here. Now, with the Cyber Global, that will be a different venue because pretty much everything we do with Cyber Global would go through, would go through Nickel, different platform, different venue, different client base, different way of paying. That, that would be a whole different situation.
Colton O'Farrell: So I got you. No, that's a, that's great insight and just helpful information for our side to understand kind of, you know, with our relationships with Banks, just understanding what kind of Revenue that will be processed.
Clinton: However, like, for an example, I've got a, I've got a client that, that I'm sure I know what's going to happen. So, their permits in approval process with the city, as soon as that permit's approved, they're going to give me, they need to give me a $20,000 deposit or progress payment. They don't have checks.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep.
Clinton: And so when I collected their deposit, she went in and zelled me $600 a day. Well, that's not going to work for 20 grand.
Colton O'Farrell: Right.
Clinton: So, I would just invoice them the 20 grand, they would go in and they would just do an ACH for the $20,000. Through their bank account, which they could do.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep.
Clinton: You know, rather than writing me a check. So I could see that for them working great. They're a younger, it's a younger, they're not, they're not in the retirement community. That would work perfect for them.
Colton O'Farrell: Awesome.
Clinton: Yeah. So that I see that working for them. Or if I'm doing a roof with someone else outside the retirement communities, you know, and I need to, I, you know, I need to have them get me the money for their materials because and materials are being delivered. So there will be those. And then remind me. And so on those ACH ones, is there a 1% fee on those?
Colton O'Farrell: There's no fee whatsoever on any ACH payments through Nickel for you or for your customers. It is always free. Okay. The main difference, so with there are limitations. So you're currently on the Nickel Core Plan. And I just wanted to let you know the Zoom, I'll catch it before it ends, but sometimes there's a timer and it just stops the meeting. So if that happens, it's because of a timer, not myself, but I'll let you know before that happens with Nickel Core, you are limited with transactions in terms of the volume of those. So with the free plan, you can do $25,000 per ACH transaction. That's not cumulative. You could do 1000 of those. You just cannot do one at $26,000 on the free plan.
Clinton: Right. I understand.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep. There's some advanced features that we don't have turned on on the free plan. So we don't have recurring billing. We don't have a debit authorization, which allows you to auto pull from customers with their permission. You can get that set up on the free plan, but basically on, or sorry, on the Nickel Plus plan. But if you upgrade to the Nickel Plus plan, it's either $45 monthly or $35 a month on an annual plan, builds out to be one time payment of $420, 20% discount. What that plan does is we speed up the ACH processing from three days on the free plan. To two days on the Nickel Plus Plan, we bump up the transaction limit from $25,000 per transaction to $1,000,000 per transaction. You can schedule payments in advance to recurring billing. You can auto debit your customers as needed. There's no other fees associated with Nickel so long as you are not eating some of that credit card surcharge on accounts receivable. Or if you're the only other way you'd pay anything else is if you are paying bills with Nickel and using a credit card. Are you planning on paying your contractors or paying bills through Nickel as well on the AP side?
Clinton: I hadn't intended on that.
Colton O'Farrell: Well, I did want to kind of explain what that would look like, but it works very similar to the accounts receivable, but that's the bill pay section here. If you click into that, you can make, you can pay your contractors and your bills with Nickel. If you pay via ACH, there's no fees whatsoever for you or for your customers. If you decide to pay with the credit card, there's a 2.90%, but that's the only way that you'd pay anything greater than the subscription. You can upgrade your account at any point. You just go into account settings, click plans and upgrade. We give every customer a two week free trial of the Nickel Plus plan. The last thing before I got about a minute 30 before this kicks me off here. The last thing is if you click this box that says, refer a new business on the Nickel, this is exactly what you did with Dan. You will have your own referral link within that box. If any customer signs up with that link and they meet the transaction threshold, you will be paid $250 per business. There's no cap on how many businesses you can get referrals for, so wanted to call that out for you. If you get two businesses on a Nickel, that pays for an entire year's worth of Nickel Plus, plus gives you $80 in addition to that. Clinton, I know we're running up here on time. It's going to kick me off in a minute. Do you mind if we throw on a meeting for about a month out from now, if we want to go through and review some of the transactions on AR and AP and just make sure everything's working as needed?
Clinton: That'd be fine.
Colton O'Farrell: Cool. I'll send it out the same time as now, just for a month out. Just one last call out is if you have any questions, you've already done this, but the Help Center right there, you have that chat feature. That's the best way to contact our team. We usually answer those within about eight minutes. You can always reach out to me, but sometimes I might be in back-to-back meetings. I always respond to emails within 24 hours, but that will be the best place for getting help. But I'm going to send you a follow-up email and that calendar invite for about a month out. Really excited to be supporting your businesses though, and really glad you chose Nickel. All right, thank you. It's been a pleasure.
Clinton: Hope you have a wonderful rest of your day, Clinton. Yeah. Bye bye.
