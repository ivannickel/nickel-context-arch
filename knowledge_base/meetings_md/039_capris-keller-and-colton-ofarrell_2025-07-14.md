Colton O'Farrell: Hello. Good morning.
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: Good morning.
Colton O'Farrell: How are you doing today?
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: I'm doing fine. How are you?
Colton O'Farrell: Doing really well. Did you have a good weekend?
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: Yes. I did, but I'm still groggy.
Colton O'Farrell: I I can relate to that, so no worries. Well, I'm glad to hear you had a good weekend.
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: I'm actually excited because I'm I'm curious. I have questions about your product.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah. Absolutely. And is your name Ndira?
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: Yes. It is.
Colton O'Farrell: Ndira, nice to meet you. Is there also another cap Capri or Capris joining us as well?
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: That's me. That's me. Oh, that's you as well. Okay. I got you. Caprisse Ndira. Mhmm.
Colton O'Farrell: Is is Caprisse your name, or is it Ndira?
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: Miss Caprisse. Ndira. But I go by Ndira.
Colton O'Farrell: Okay. I gotcha. Well, it's a pleasure to meet you. My name is, Colton. I'm a part of the sales team here at Nickel. So I'll be the one having the conversation with you today, hopefully, show you our product, given your use cases. But how I'd really like to start, these conversations is wanna learn, more about you, your business, how you found Nickel, and what really got you on this call today.
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: Oh, I was, we have QuickBooks, and we've getting a lot of requests for ACH and, from, like, a big company that wants to buy our product, which we sell we sell coins and so forth. And most of the time, they just, you know, send us a check or pay with PayPal, but we request someone requested for ACH, and we didn't have it really set up except for payroll. So so I just did a little surfing on the Internet, and somehow or you came up. And then I just fill out the paperwork and, you know, got started like that.
Colton O'Farrell: I gotcha. And so von Keller and Co family is the company that what what is your role within the company?
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: Von Keller and Colton is a holding company, but we have, multiple companies underneath. We have a hotel business, for apartment, homes that are all over where we rent out apartments. And those are generally done through our through our channels wherever we're we're renting the units at, and those are done with a credit card mostly. And then we have we have our we sell coins, and that business, basically, credit card, once again, no need for ACH for the customer. So, that's why we inquired.
Colton O'Farrell: So were you looking for a Nickel solution for these other divisions as well, one particular? What what is that kind of ideal setup look for like for you?
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: I think that once we are in and we're doing it, we'll probably open that option up to my other divisions too. Yeah. It's just we've been keeping it simple. Just super, super simple. If it isn't broken, don't fix it, and we do pretty well. So but, you know, the whole payment industry of how payments are coming, they're all it's all altering. We just started accepting crypto, you know, so we have to get on board. You know? Mhmm. Mhmm. So I figured we'd you know, I'm I'm just old. I'm just you know, like, I'm 60 years old, and I'm like, why do we need to do that? But I'm I'm realizing that I'm getting too many requests.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep. You're noticing some patterns and knowing that you have to at least you know, it's coming up more and more often. What it is is what we do.
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: I think think people were like because of fraud, they're wanting some type of link sent or something where they don't really
Colton O'Farrell: Secure hyperlink?
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: Yeah. They they they're not wanting to reveal their banking details.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep. Of course.
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: That so for me, respecting that and the fact that you have the verification through Plaid, I have to respect what my customers wanna do, you know, even though most of them are old. But, you know, gold and coin owners are, like, old old school.
Colton O'Farrell: You know? My dad my dad buys a lot of silver. So I
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: Yeah. Exactly. You know, they they have this particular one they want, but the customers are are old school. And but when they start to ask for the link, you know, you you have to accommodate them and stuff.
Colton O'Farrell: So it sounds like, you know, we're we're trying to create better solutions for you to work with your customers, but then also on the ACH front, you're doing those trans transactions through QuickBooks online today, it sounds like?
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: Yeah. I
Colton O'Farrell: You're charging a one percent fee on that, I imagine?
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: No. I haven't been doing any QuickBooks unless it's payroll.
Colton O'Farrell: But Okay. I gotcha.
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: I haven't been doing it because we do a pretty good volume. You know, when people buy, they they buy what they want. This is like their savings account. You know?
Colton O'Farrell: Yep. Yep.
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: So when and I work with Charles Schwab. It's a brokerage company because because of the high volume, my account is there. And with the broker account, no matter what you have, you have everyone has the personal. That's how they pay it you know, how you pay into it, and then you can move it into the various accounts. But Right. They make it easy because they're not a traditional bank. It's a brokerage, and they don't be you know, they can take I can take wires and different things, and they're just not bothering me. But other, you know, banks sometimes can be, like, really digging into what we do. And Mhmm. And trying to explain someone buying gold and coins to a bank officer is a little difficult. They start thinking you're mining gold and you know?
Colton O'Farrell: Right. Right.
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: Kids are digging in the dirt and da da da da da. It's just really a big pain. But with Charles Schwab, I don't have that to worry about. So but I did the plaid. And on my Charles end, it says that it's connected to your platform. But on your end, it said failed. So I'm kinda curious about that.
Colton O'Farrell: The Plaid the Plaid authorization failed?
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: Yeah. It said failed, but then when I went into Charles Schwab as for what was linked, you're linked. Your company is linked.
Colton O'Farrell: You what did you sign up the company name as? Was it von Keller and Co?
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: No. I think it was Raw Golden Diamond Company. Maybe I should've just used my name because that's how the Charles Schwab account is.
Colton O'Farrell: You said that was rock rock diamond?
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: No. It's Raw Gold and Diamond Company.
Colton O'Farrell: Raw Gold and Diamond Company.
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: So that's what I signed up. But when I did the plan, it it just wouldn't, go.
Colton O'Farrell: That's a good that's a good note to make, and I will But
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: we need to. I can't change my bank account at all. So we need to link it because that's where the funds will go. And so because, like I said, what we do, we have to work with that brokerage account. Mhmm. So I don't know if that's a Plaid thing or if I need to change the name on the company and maybe put my first name, last name because my brokerage account has that. I don't know what's happening with Plaid. But I know
Colton O'Farrell: It's your tongue. It's
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: On my back end, it says connected. And on your end, it said failed.
Colton O'Farrell: Interesting. Okay. I'll be sure to talk to our regulatory and compliance team and, you know, I can share the the information from this call here. But, yeah, we have a separate team that handles that, of course. So it's you you were able to go ahead and create the your Nickel account, and it sounds like trying to link the bank account, but the Plaid verification was failing?
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: Yeah. It always fails. I always have failed, Plaids, but I don't know if they're specifically looking for, like, that business checking. But, you know, with a brokerage account, it wouldn't come up like that. So for any type of high volume, you're not gonna be able to have an account that necessarily states the name that that is on the business because brokerage accounts, they're kinda like a institutional account that you are part of a you know what I'm saying? So I don't
Colton O'Farrell: Of course.
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: If if it's if if we're not able to link it, then that means I'm happen to go out and get a retail bank. And then with the volume that I do, we could have problems.
Colton O'Farrell: Right. So We'll be able I I wanted know, we'll take that. We'll cross that bridge when we get to there. We like I had mentioned, we have the compliance regulatory team that will be able to help. Okay. Caprice, I wanted to ask with your current knowledge. I know you've done some digging into Nickel what we offer. It sounds like you have a, you know, you've taken some time to look through what we could provide your customers. But on a scale of, like, one to 10 as a pulse range, where would you put your, like, familiarity and comfortability with working with Nickel on a scale of one to 10 with that, 10 being the high range?
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: Well, your dashboard is super, super simple, which I know there's always a back back office, you know, but yours your your dashboard is is like, you know, some of these dashboards are very complicated.
Colton O'Farrell: Right. Too complicated.
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: They don't need to be complicated. And it would it be I don't do credit cards for, coins, you know, because of chargeback.
Colton O'Farrell: Because of charge do you, get people trying to purchase with credit cards often and then you get a chargeback?
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: I do pay only do PayPal because of the fact that, you could check out our website. It's, rgdcmoneyx.com.
Colton O'Farrell: Rgdcmoneyx.com?
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: Yes. And, I'm set you up getting my coffee. No
Colton O'Farrell: worries. Where where are you, based out of, by the way?
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: Louisiana.
Colton O'Farrell: Louisiana? Nice. I'm in Chicago myself.
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: Yeah. Yeah. So so so we ship we have a wholesaler that we ship from. So I basically do PayPal because after 2,500, you know they have to be verified. Mhmm. They can't buy too much volume. And and I don't have hardly none of my customers they mostly do phone orders, but, they're long term customers. So
Colton O'Farrell: Awesome. Well, Keppers, did were you able to see the, short kinda demo video that we send over, or have you not had a chance to view that yet?
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: I think I did. Yes. I did look at it before I signed up. Mhmm.
Colton O'Farrell: Okay. Awesome. Well, if you've seen that, I mean, that covers a lot of what I would be walking through today. But I think one thing that might be helpful is just to explain a little bit about our security and, data protection, like that standpoint there, because I know that's a pretty important aspect for your customers. So I'm just gonna go ahead and share my screen here. So, just wanted to let you know. So we, at Nickel, we're trusted by over 10,000 businesses from an accounts receivable and accounts payable perspective or both. We are SOC two compliant. We protect all of your customers' information when we're sending invoices with secured payment links that can be sent either via SMS or via, email that has encryption and tokenization so that we'll provide exactly what your customers are looking for. When it comes to credit card fees, I know this is something that you don't accept today. That is something that you would be able to accept just by default within Nickel. So I will notice when we send off a secured payment link I can pull an old demo one that I've sent. When you send off a secured payment link to your customer, they will receive an email that looks like this. So it will have your
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: company name. Me take Okay. It has my logo. Okay. No problem. Payment. Okay. That's nice.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah. So the invoice will also be attached there.
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: And that's for the credit card. Right? Not to interrupt you.
Colton O'Farrell: This is for either option. So they could pay so when they hit this pay now option, they'll be brought to this screen here. I'll zoom out just a little bit so you can see. But they'll have the option to pay by card if they would like with the there's a 2.99% fee that is a 100% paid for by your customer. If you wanted to adjust that for any reason, you are able to do so. But one thing with the credit card aspect, so when it comes to, the fees there, you're you'd never have to worry about the the PCI compliance. We handle all of that on your behalf. You just need to you'll just get the net amount. So if this was a you know, this is a small invoice here, but if it's $500, we're, you know, making $14.93. We take that. We handle the PCI compliance. You're only ever gonna get the net amount. So
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: Now that's good. I mean, I have no problems using that. It's not a problem at all. You know, with the with the hotel business, you have people who I've had people stay and still try to dispute the charges after they left. You know? So that's why we go through third party like Airbnb and booking and all stuff like that. Those channels, they collect, and then we don't have any problems. And I and, you know, it's a nightmare when someone does that. We had a peculiar situation where some FBI agents were staying in a two bedroom in in California, and they were doing a sting operation on a bunch of Asian women having babies coming to America in the building. So they were winning. And after it was over with, I guess they must have used their FBI card to book it, and they it was paid for. They disputed it, the the the the two people. And I said to myself
Colton O'Farrell: So bizarre.
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: So I said to myself, this doesn't make any sense. So I went down there, and I took pictures. They were still there disputing and still in the unit after being there two months. And so because the money withdrew from my account. And so when I went down there, I I took a picture of their car and plates and everything, and I sent it off to a friend. And the friend say, nothing is coming up. He say, these are government agents. I said, mhmm. So I called I called my lawyer I called my lawyer, and he had his paralegal call. And then she said she said, listen. If if if if we don't get the payment by the end of the the day, we're gonna go ahead and file a civil suit against you guys, which I knew they were agents that was spying on the pregnant women after the bus happened and because they were Asian. And and I knew that they most likely was disputing the charges so they could pocket that profit Oh, wow. Extra money. Yes.
Colton O'Farrell: That's crazy.
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: So because I had to meditate on it, and I have pretty good insight. So when she told them a cashier's check need to make it here for x y zed, that man ran to pay her because he's a federal agent, and I basically busted him. They didn't
Colton O'Farrell: know if
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: it wasn't if it wasn't for the fact that I went and did a little recon on their car.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah. You were, a part time agent there yourself.
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: Yeah. But all business has risk. So what I do that's why I hadn't been doing anything. But I take checks. Like, right now, I'm depositing a a $80,000 check. And and and at Charles Schwab because I never have any problems with checks. So I love checks. You know? And once you've got my goal, I don't need you coming back talking about you didn't get it. You know what I'm saying? And coming back for me on a credit card with that amount of money. You you just got a million dollars worth of gold, $2,000,000 worth of gold, and you're trying to dispute the charges. That's like a nightmare. That could shut me down.
Colton O'Farrell: Right. Absolutely. So
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: the ACH, you know, it has a verification component to it. So that I kinda said, okay. I'm okay with that. But I'm a little you know, you can understand why I'm a little leery with credit cards.
Colton O'Farrell: Of course. Yeah. And and most people, you know, there there's a lot of people that are a lot of companies that we talk to, they never accept credit cards before they start working with Nickel. What I'll tell you though is even if people don't think that their customers are gonna use credit cards, our data internally shows that about one fifth of all invoices are paid with a credit card. And our largest invoice amount like, some of these people don't think that they're like, okay. Yeah. Maybe for smaller invoices. But we've had clients pay an invoice charge with a credit card for half a million dollars. So there's no real limit.
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: We tell you, and that's faster payout. And so
Colton O'Farrell: And there's, like, things like the forty day float, credit card points. Every, you know, company has their reasons for why they do that. But one thing is
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: You you know gold doesn't have a very large markup. You know, we we make the money in volume. So if we spend, you know, making you know, doing 20,000,000 and then and we're getting 1.5 points, that's how we make our money. This is how we pay the bills. And so I just have to look at the risk.
Colton O'Farrell: One one question I had well, I guess it's kind of two questions. So with this particular division and maybe as the group as a whole, what are you guys doing in terms of annual revenue? And then, what are you imagining to be transacting kind of through the Nickel platform?
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: Well, customers who do checks, we just keep the checks because they're old school. But being able to offer the ACH probably would give us more customers, but we're doing I think last year, we did, like, 50,000,000 in sales because, you know, I sell gold bars, and sometimes we can sell to banks. You know?
Colton O'Farrell: Right.
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: So so, you know, it's not that difficult to take a order.
Colton O'Farrell: So What So with the checks, I know that's that's working for you well and and not much of an issue. I would still say that one thing with this secure payment link that you can generate and send to your customer via text or email, we actually have a lot of customers who move away from checks to doing this because of well, typically, if they're if they're mailing that to you, you won't see that check for ten to fourteen days on kind of the the quick end. Mhmm. Sometimes people say this in the check and they actually have not yet. Checks can get lost in the mail. This right here, this allows them to pay you, pay you instantly.
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: I would probably switch to this if especially if the turnaround time is faster. That's why I'm reading, and I would send them the link so that they can just log in and not write the check. So it would be a conversion that we have to delicately do with existing customers because some of the customers, like you know, like your dad.
Colton O'Farrell: Oh, cool.
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: Yeah. He's only buying so many you know, this like, they they're just stacking that up as savings. You know?
Colton O'Farrell: Absolutely.
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: And so thing I wanted to silver is and silver, by the way, is, like, we can't keep it in stock.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah. Absolute trust me. My dad has so many silver coins and bars.
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: That's your inheritance.
Colton O'Farrell: I know. I am not mad about it.
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: He's probably doesn't trust the banks. You know?
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah. And
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: that's how most people are. But for me, you don't have to worry. If my customer wanna pay in credit card, then that's fine. But a a $23,000,000 order is not gonna pull out a card. You know? But if they wanna pull out a card and but I you know, most credit card processing don't give you that high volume of approval for the merger. And I don't like jumping through approvals for credit cards. I'm a be honest with you.
Colton O'Farrell: That makes sense.
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: After you finish exposing all your stuff, they still don't they still give you a low cap. So, you know, I don't like I don't like bending over doing a whole bunch just so I could take a card. It's just not
Colton O'Farrell: Well, the nice thing is with Nickel, we handle all that on your behalf. So it's just an option for your customers, but you can actually go into, like, an individual invoice level. So I you I believe you saw this in the demo video, but if you're on QuickBooks online, connecting to your account is very easy. You just go to account settings, integrations, click link your QuickBooks account. That brings everything into the Nickel platform from an accounts payable perspective as well as an accounts receivable perspective here. You can actually so everything would be pulled into here. You would just come to this far side where it's it would say payment request. I've already sent these off, so that's why it says, I can send a reminder if I'd like. You can actually open up these individual invoices. There's that secured payment link there. But if you wanted to, you could disable credit card payments. Otherwise, we have this option here. So by default, a 100% of that credit card surcharge will be paid by your customer. That's a global rule that you can set up and you can
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: change Yeah. I saw it online. Yeah.
Colton O'Farrell: But if you wanted to, for example, you had a special agreement, you could come in and override that setting on individual invoice level. We'll just keep this at a 100, though. But, yes, it's, gonna bring all of your attachments, invoices from QuickBooks online. You'll just be able to send that easily to your customer via email. That's where you
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: guys really win is with the merchant account because the ACH is not really making you the big bucks. It's really the the I I've talked to another company on the ACH. They were charging 500 a month.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep. And we we don't make any money from ACH, but
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: We don't make any money from ACH. But this is the thing. A lot of people will buy with credit card. That's gonna happen, but that's gonna be my low volume people. Yep. That's not gonna be no worse.
Colton O'Farrell: Even if our customers themselves are never doing any credit card payments, say they're on our free plan, they're only doing ACH. Yep. That's true. We're not making any money from them. But like I mentioned earlier, one fifth of all invoices are paid for with a credit card. There's also kind of the network effect where, you know, people get from get exposure to Nickel because their customers are working with us. They potentially could come to us.
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: Exactly. You definitely it's smart. I was talking to someone the other day, and I would say some of these companies have become quite brilliant. They're offering a free plan now instead of the stupid trial to force you to a payment, and then they know they're gonna convert some of those free customers at some point. Yeah. And it's just really brilliant because sometimes people are billing their company, and they just need that free plan for right now. Soon as the money starts flowing, you know, they're like, okay. I'm upgrading. You know? Me, I need the see, you have a cap on the ACH at 25. That's not gonna work for me.
Colton O'Farrell: Right. Yeah. Especially without with the the volume that you're doing.
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: No. No. No. No.
Colton O'Farrell: No. Just wanted
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: to able to pay the 45 or, you know, probably first order, I'll just pay for the year. But the thing is, I just wanna make sure, you know, everything's working. But, like, right now, the the plan didn't stick. So that's gonna be
Colton O'Farrell: a question. Sure to escalate this up to the
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: even know if it was a because I would have processed actually a payment of I would have had a payment going out to today, but the the plan didn't stick. So I said, well, I've gotta come back and work with them on that to see if that's gonna work, before I upgrade.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep. So I just wanted to pull up the pricing page just to clarify. So you already noticed that, yes, with the free plan, it is a 100% free. However, we do limit that to $25,000 per
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: Yeah. ACH. Don't have any I don't have any $25,000 ACH, unfortunately. All my ACHs are ranging between, like, twenty twenty, 35, 36, 37. The big clients, you know, like I said, they normally even wire me and stuff, so they may be a it may be a surprise for them to start doing ACH instead of doing fair transfer? Mhmm. So I I would definitely, my wire customers will start to look at the ACH. You know? But the small customers who buy a few coins on the $6,700, they're gonna definitely probably switch over to the credit card. But remember, a lot of my orders do come from the web site. So That's
Colton O'Farrell: a great thing I wanted
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: to Yeah. We have a WordPress, and so I don't know if you have a plug in. So
Colton O'Farrell: What was the question? Sorry. I missed the I heard the
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: plug in. A WordPress website. So, you know, it works with it's at WooCommerce.
Colton O'Farrell: Every customer oh, and I I'm familiar with WooCommerce. We don't have, like,
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: Plug in yet. Plug
Colton O'Farrell: in to, like, a WooCommerce, but what we do equip all of our customers with. In addition so you saw that secured payment link that's tied to, like, individual invoices. Mhmm. In addition to that, so when we're processing invoices, whether if you're doing multiple invoices, say, were sending, like, all of these out, could send payment request all at once. Even if we're sending all of these out at once, we're never doing batch processing where there could be potential mix up with some of the invoices or amounts or just data getting, murky there. We're doing one to one reconciliation. So each of those secured payment links, they're tied to one one customer, one bank account. So it's that one to one reconciliation between you, your customer, and the banks. So you never have to worry about that there. But we also equip all of our customers with a merchant payment link that can actually be embedded in their website. We can create a custom domain for you. You can modify any of this kind of, like, background here just in account settings. So when you're putting your branding, banner, you can adjust this to be whatever you'd like. A lot of our customers will just take this payment link and they'll they'll embed it in their website to serve either as a backup solution if their main method is not working or some people just prefer to have, you know, this is kind of a a way for their customers just to pop in pop in here and pay them whatever they need. But this is just kind of an example of what it looked like. So, again, they have that card option or they could, pay just with ACH.
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: Okay. Let me look at it. Hold on a second.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah. Yeah. Let me just go let me change the method here. They wanted to pay the
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: Give me one second. Hold on one second. Yeah. I'm back. I'm sorry about that.
Colton O'Farrell: No worries.
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: Yeah. That was just my son calling. So so so you're talking about the my own payment my my own page. Right?
Colton O'Farrell: Yep.
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: Okay. Okay.
Colton O'Farrell: So this link this link here
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: So how would that work with WordPress real quick?
Colton O'Farrell: So you would just you could copy this link, and you could embed it directly into, like, WordPress or the web page that you're having. Like, you would customize this to be
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: put it as a ACH or alternative credit card payment on the on the item itself, but it wouldn't be part of the shopping cart.
Colton O'Farrell: No. So this this would just be, essentially, a lot of customers could use this as, like, a backup method. So, like, a lot of people will say, like, they'll have a make a payment on the website, and they will embed this link directly there, but they'll continue to send out, like, the the AC or the secured payment links tied to an individual invoice. This will just serve as, like, a potential another option if you need or for whatever reason your primary methods are not working. This is just at least something to have just
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: On my QuickBooks, we do counting from a third party. So I have to sign up for Chris crip the the I have to sign up for QuickBooks to link it because it seems like ACH and QuickBooks kinda go together. But it this is the question. Essentially, we're not returning off the ACH at QuickBooks level?
Colton O'Farrell: Yep.
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: Okay. So So invoice wise, if I send out an invoice, I'm signed up for QuickBooks just to process through you guys and link it and start doing the invoices this way, where would the link be?
Colton O'Farrell: So to to explain with with QuickBooks Online how how you'd be working. So what question for you. When you generate an invoice for a customer, are you having
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: to go out of it? I do it through the WordPress, not to QuickBooks. So we would generate the order there, and they either shop you know, we keep everything on the site. The site is a functioning site. So it has that, accountability there.
Colton O'Farrell: So we don't have a a plug in necessarily like No.
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: No. I understand. I understand that. Cool. So but if I alright. Let's say
Colton O'Farrell: If you were on QuickBooks online, I'll walk
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: in I link if I link the QuickBooks to you, I just wanted to know where is that button.
Colton O'Farrell: So the the link button is right here. So you just go to account settings. You just go to integrations. You would click link QuickBooks account. This would bring you to Intuit's QuickBooks page. You'd sign in to your account. You would select your, company, chart of accounts, and then everything would flow back into Nickel. And there's some automation we can set up. So if I were to link this, there would be a button that has, like, an automation here where if I turn that on, anytime I were to generate an invoice from QuickBooks, it would just automatically send via email or via SMS to your customer in that same method that I showed you right here. The one time it's not good at that automation turned on is if you're generating an invoice, but you need to go back and you need to make, edits, modifications, other people are touching that invoice. Because each time there's any kind of changes made, your customer would get an email each time because it's an updated invoice. So if you're doing that, we recommend not having it on. You would just come in to the get paid. You just come out over here to send those off. Otherwise, if that automation's turned on because you're just generating an invoice one time and it's good to send to the customer, you won't even have to worry about that. We will just automatically send that to your customer. They can pay for it however however they would like.
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: Now is this this this automation that you're sending, is it inside the invoice or separate?
Colton O'Farrell: The the automation is for any kind of invoice that is created from QuickBooks just to be sent off once it's been created and and you complete it.
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: A QuickBooks invoice, and then somewhere on the page is your link.
Colton O'Farrell: So it's a QuickBooks invoice that is generated from QuickBooks. We are just the the payment processor and the person that is or the company that is sending the invoice to your customer in a way that they can pay you. So we're we're still sending that secured payment link either via email or via SMS. It's just once it's generated from QuickBooks, we have this automation turned on that Nickel essentially takes over, and then we send that out to your customer.
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: It's a it's a takeover. So they still get to open up the, QuickBooks, but then they can see the payment?
Colton O'Farrell: They they will see they will see an email that looks like this, or they will see a text
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: message that looks So where's the so the and this is the invoice.
Colton O'Farrell: So the link is embedded right here in this pay now button. So this is the secured payment link. If I could show you as well, like, on so this is right here. This is that secured payment link. If I were to plug it in right here, you're gonna see the same thing. And you could copy and paste this and send this to them, or it's just it's embedded in that pay now button.
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: Okay. So, basically, you're only connecting the QuickBooks. So what I would have to do from what I know, QuickBooks has there's a third party app that would do a plug in to the WooCommerce, which would pull in all my products, okay, and orders, right, and customers and la la la la. Then now I'm linking my QuickBooks that I pulled from my functioning site to you. Now now that's there. So then from there, it's just a pay now. That's is is it. Okay.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep. Exactly.
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: That's all I wanted to understand. Because on the QuickBooks, I'm not gonna check any payment from QuickBooks. I'm not gonna take their payments.
Colton O'Farrell: Just
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: I don't even turn it on.
Colton O'Farrell: You you wouldn't you wouldn't necessarily need to in in that situation.
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: So if that's the case, I just need the basic.
Colton O'Farrell: Sorry. I maybe maybe I I'm I'm No.
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: No. No. The QuickBooks has different diff different tiers.
Colton O'Farrell: So QuickBooks Online is what you would want.
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: But it's QuickBooks Online, not the the desktop?
Colton O'Farrell: Correct. Yep. And I don't even think desktop is really like, that's one product that they've mostly moved away for. Like, you usually have to get it kind of almost, like, black black market or, like, value added reseller
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: I think so. Sort of people. Market.
Colton O'Farrell: Kind of. There's people that are selling their old, like, QuickBooks desktop, like because otherwise, if you buy it new, you have to pay, like, $2 a year annually for
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: certain Jesus Christ. Mhmm. I see what you're saying now. So this makes sense. So, I'm pretty happy with that so far. Everything makes sense. It's what is explained on the site with kinda what I figured with the automation. We have developers, so my developers know how to do a lot of stuff.
Colton O'Farrell: Awesome. Yeah. I unfortunately, I'm about to get kicked off this this meeting.
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: So if it does hang up, it's going not meeting with another brand.
Colton O'Farrell: Well, I'm gonna go ahead and send a follow-up email with some resources. Mostly the things that we covered, I'll also share that demo recap video in case you need to share that with anyone else. You've already registered for the account. You just need to link a payment method in order to begin sending and receiving. I know there's that plat issue, so I will surface that with the team. But my goal is to really equip you with all the information you need to be successful.
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: It's pretty you know, it's not complicated, that's one of
Colton O'Farrell: the And it's designed not to be.
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: It's not. It's not complicated. And it's very rare to go on a site that doesn't have a lot of complications because you're not trying to do a bunch of other stuff.
Colton O'Farrell: Yes. Exactly.
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: Very simple. I went on another call with another company, they had all kind of stuff that was so complicated, bank accounts. The platform had a wallet, and it was just bomb bomb.
Colton O'Farrell: Right. No. I mean, that's designed
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: I just did not sign up. I did not.
Colton O'Farrell: Exactly. Well, hey. You signed up with us, and I'm really excited to see how
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: I'm happy with Nickel. I even called someone and told them about it, another business owner, I say, hey. Y'all need to check this out. I don't even know how they came up because companies like yours don't come up.
Colton O'Farrell: You know? If you do that, I know this isn't isn't a ton, but, I did wanna point out that we do any businesses that you refer to Nickel. We do wanna incentivize, and and we will, give referral bonuses for that as well. Just a little something there to know if if those customers keep trying to recommend
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: it because, like I said, I go on a lot of sites. And, like, one of the things that you said on your site was, like, we don't have any hard limits. And a lot of sites are just trip they're kinda crazy with these limits.
Colton O'Farrell: Hidden fees too? We we have zero hidden fees. That's something
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: Honey, if it's not broke, don't fix it. Just keep going on what you're doing because businesses don't need complication from a vendor.
Colton O'Farrell: Yes.
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: We just don't. And nobody needs someone tethering your amounts, especially or doing I I went through a whole big thing with Stripe, set up everything. The first payment for gold came in. They fucking turned down the ACA because it was for 435, thousand.
Colton O'Farrell: Jesus.
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: And and they said it was high risk, and then I had to go look at what they accept. Guess what? They don't accept any metal companies. They don't accept hotel companies. I said, well, what the fuck are you
Colton O'Farrell: What do you accept? So you're
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: Stripe. Right. Stripe is a company that just wants any mom and pop that is making their money from $2.50. Right. You know, or or hotel restaurant or something. So I I was very disappointed in Stripe. Very, very disappointed after setting all that stuff up that my company was not a company they like to work with.
Colton O'Farrell: Can't imagine. Your your story is not alone. I mean, we get a ton of customers from Stripe, from Mello, bill.com, QuickBooks Online if they're just you doing that ACH. And I'll I'll link our reviews. I'm sure you've read some of those. But, I mean Yes.
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: I did.
Colton O'Farrell: G two, we have a 4.9 out of five review. Our our customers are very happy with us. And
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: Let me tell you. I saw a bank account online just recently. It had cannabis on there. Cannabis customers. I said, if they're accepting cannabis, they love metals. Do know? Yeah. Exactly. Because I'm right there with the cannabis. Right?
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah. Exactly.
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: So I'm like, it's so it's so funny.
Colton O'Farrell: No. I did wanna just say, Caprice, it's about to cut off. I can see this. I wanted to thank you for your time. I'm gonna owe you an email. I'll send that to you.
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: No. I will go to your next meeting.
Colton O'Farrell: I'll
H.H. Ndira von Keller, CEO: talk to you later.
Colton O'Farrell: Yes. Talk to you soon. Really
