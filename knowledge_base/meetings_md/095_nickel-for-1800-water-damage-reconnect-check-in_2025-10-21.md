iPhone (2): Hello?
Christian Sheerer: Hey Charles, how's it going?
iPhone (2): Good, sorry I was- No worries. Just a customer meeting and then they were referred to me by their neighbor. So that's what I was. I stopped over their house real quick just to see them while I was there. So anyways, sorry.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, no worries.
iPhone (2): So I will share with you. I haven't had a chance to get everything signed up. So I'm working on doing that this afternoon because we have had a few jobs come in. And I just haven't had a second to sit down and go through all the stuff I need to do to sign up. No worries.
Christian Sheerer: Did you want to do that now? And I could help chat through if any questions come up as you're going through it.
iPhone (2): Yeah, that's fine. If we can do it over, I'm driving, but if we could do it, while I'm driving. Oh, yeah.
Christian Sheerer: You'll need to be in front of a desktop. I think, yeah. Unless you had any questions that we could cover on, like while you were going through the process, I don't know if it would be too fruitful while you're driving, unless you needed anything refreshed briefly, because ultimately you need to be in front of a computer.
iPhone (2): So the neighbor there, they own a roofing company. And I was just telling her that I was jumping on here to discuss our, you know, credit card processing and I, the one question I was going to ask is what is that percentage?
Christian Sheerer: Like what is- 2.99.
iPhone (2): Okay, so roughly 3%. Okay. Got it. All right.
Christian Sheerer: I mean, yeah, over time, it's a difference on the 2.99 versus 3. So, I get a stickler about it, but yeah, 2.99 versus like the 3. To four that you were doing previously.
iPhone (2): Okay. And again, as we talked about before, 99% of it is going to be, what the heck? Oh, there is a cover right there. Thank you. 99% of it's going to be, passed along to the customer, but in those infrequent situations where they're going to pay in advance and we're going to waive the processing fee for them, we can easily just turn it off and turn it back on per transaction, correct?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, that's 100%.
iPhone (2): Correct. Okay. Yeah, no, I mean, having dug into this a little bit more, I mean, this is a big cost that I honestly really wasn't paying that close attention to. And, Now looking at it, I wish I was. It's, you know, it's a big number. And it's a, you know, it would make a big difference in my bottom line, the business in general.
Christian Sheerer: So that's why, yeah, 100%.
iPhone (2): Definitely. I'm definitely going to get this squared away today and finalize so we can get it going.
Christian Sheerer: Okay.
iPhone (2): Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: Did you want to, I mean, I'm happy to set aside like 20 minutes to help you through it later. I mean, you can, it's pretty foolproof you can handle on your own. The other thing I would suggest is maybe after you had a chance to run through some transactions, maybe later this week we get together and see if there's anything we need to troubleshoot.
iPhone (2): Okay, yeah, no, that'll work. Let me, if I have any questions, because I'm going to be back to my office here in about 30 minutes. So, and you said it shouldn't take more than like 20 to 30 minutes to get set up, correct? Yep. Okay, yeah, so if I, I mean, if anything pops up and I have questions, I'll reach out to you, but I've got quite a few transactions that we've got in the queue that I want to get kind of processed, but I also, I'm just trying to manage my cash flow too a little bit just to make sure I'm prepared for that little delay versus what I'm at right now. But again, That should be easily smoothed out within a week's time or so. I'm not worried about that. But okay, all right, perfect. Yeah, sorry, like I said, we've just-- no, it's all good. I had a little bit of an issue that came up Thursday evening. After we spoke that I'm still trying to deal with. And then on top of that, we just had three new jobs come in. So it's been a good busy and a little bit of a nervous busy at the same time.
Christian Sheerer: I hear you. Yeah, no worries at all. I mean, yeah, this is for you. So whatever timeline you want to work on.
iPhone (2): Okay.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, just reach out to me if there's anything that comes up. You have my cell. And then when I see that gets kind of gone through on our system, I'll reach out and we can set up some time for Friday to connect.
iPhone (2): Okay, perfect.
Christian Sheerer: Perfect. All right, well, good luck with the bad busy and the good busy. And I'll be here. Yeah, email or over the phone if there's anything weird that pops up.
iPhone (2): Okay, sounds good.
Christian Sheerer: All right, Charles, I'll see you soon.
iPhone (2): Appreciate it. Thank you.
Christian Sheerer: No problem. Drive safe.
iPhone (2): Bye.
