Jacob Greenberg: Jason.
Jason Lilly: Jacob, how are you?
Jacob Greenberg: Good. How are you doing?
Jason Lilly: Doing well, thank you.
Jacob Greenberg: Awesome. So I see you made some time on our calendar. I'm happy we were able to connect. You gave a little bit of notes here. So you guys have a small craft cocktail lounge. You guys have QuickBooks online. Just to give you some background on myself, I was working with Toast. Are you familiar with the point of sale system?
Jason Lilly: That's who we use.
Jacob Greenberg: Oh, you guys use Toast?
Jason Lilly: Yeah, so we use Toast as well.
Jacob Greenberg: Awesome. I've been so I just started working at Nickel last couple months and I came from Toast where I was for about three and a half years. So I'm really familiar with the industry. Oh, cool. Yeah, so walk me through why you're exploring Nickel and what's going on.
Jason Lilly: Okay, so Actually, since you were with Toast, this probably helps. So for a long time, we were Toast Extra Chef as well, which sucks. It's not a great product. We since moved over to Craftable to help with our invoicing, which is good. But we don't have, and then we have a bookkeeper that does our QuickBooks, but she doesn't pay the bills. And so we don't really have a bill pay service. So I started looking for a bill pay service. So I'm looking to streamline. As of right now, we have our invoices that go into inventory. So things that we buy that go into drinks. Those go into Craftable and Craftable syncs those over with QuickBooks. But a lot of the ones that aren't in inventory, like let's just say our electric bill, our cleaning bills, things like that. Those, we have those invoices and we have to manually put them into QuickBooks. Okay. So I'm looking for something that'll help me with Bill Pay. And then I'm also hoping that, do you guys have the ability to sort of scan invoices and put them into the system kind of thing?
Jacob Greenberg: We don't, but it is on our product roadmap. Kind of where we're at right now, and I'll give you some background on Nickel before I hop into demo. So have you created an account or checked out the platform at all, or. Is this the first I engagement stumbled.
Jason Lilly: You have with us? across you today.
Jacob Greenberg: Oh, awesome. How did you find us?
Jason Lilly: Reddit.
Jacob Greenberg: Oh, cool. Nice.
Jason Lilly: With people complaining about, what's the name of it? Mirio or something?
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, Melio.
Jason Lilly: Melio.
Jacob Greenberg: We got a lot of people coming over from Melio. Awesome. Yeah, so I'll give some background on us. So, Nickel was actually our founder is from like the built world industry. So he used to work at Stanley Black and Decker. And when we launched our product, it was really for construction companies. companies, the built world industries, right?
Jason Lilly: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: And we found really quickly that there's a wider application and people looking for services like ours. We had a lot of accountants starting to come in and we created tools specifically for them. And now we have a wider range of companies that are looking to get onboarded with Nickel. So are the process and stage that we're at right now is we work really closely with businesses for product iteration. So we, you know, help with onboarding and then when there's any product feedback, we're very responsive to trying to develop those very quickly. We typically, so as you see, like ACH is completely free and unlimited with Nickel. The way that we make money is off of credit card processing. So in the industry that we were initially developed for, we find like 17% of the transactions are looking at credit card. So we're able to offer free ACH because of that. For you guys, you guys can probably sign up on the free plan. I'd be interested to see how this is working with my personal background and familiarity with tools like Craftable for restaurants and stuff. Typically, the businesses that we work with are more industrial than the individual restaurant. But for your use case, it seems like this is something that would work very easily. So really what we're going to be able to do for you guys in your instance is when you make a payment, we do sync with QuickBooks. Are you using QuickBooks Online or QuickBooks Desktop? Online. Perfect. So we have an API with QuickBooks Online. So you'll activities be able from to Nickel. do all of your bill pay, If those, do you have any individual transactions that are over $25,000 per transaction?
Jason Lilly: No.
Jacob Greenberg: Then you'll be able to sign up with the Nickel Core plan.
Jason Lilly: The only thing I liked in the other plan is being able to schedule payments in advance, but maybe end recurring payments.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, I guess you guys probably do have some recurring payments like rent and things like that, cleaning services. Yeah. Yeah, so yeah, it is a nice tool and frankly it's pretty affordable tool as well. So you can upgrade at any point. You could get started for free and then upgrade. But yeah, I could walk you through a little bit of a demo for you guys though. It seems like the what you're trying to solve for is definitely going to be able to be done within Nickel. We have an awesome QuickBooks. You can start right now and you can test it out. Yeah. For your bill pay.
Jason Lilly: Yeah, so if you don't mind showing me the platform and walking me through it a little bit, I'd appreciate that.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, for sure. Where are you guys based?
Jason Lilly: Orange County, California.
Jacob Greenberg: Nice, very cool.
Jason Lilly: What about you guys?
Jacob Greenberg: We're in Brooklyn. I'm in Brooklyn right now. Okay. I lived out in Lincoln Heights for a couple years.
Jason Lilly: Oh, okay.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah. What's the arts district? All right, here, let me, Share my screen. Can you see what I'm looking at here? Awesome. So when you're making these payments, are you primarily doing ACH, credit card, check, at the moment? How are you doing your build?
Jason Lilly: Either ACH or primarily ACH, sometimes Reddit card when we can. And then sometimes they like in the alcohol industry, they have, well, I guess they have fintech, but I don't know, sometimes they have their own payment platform.
Jacob Greenberg: Can you tell me a little bit about fintech, actually?
Jason Lilly: I don't know a ton about fintech. All I know is they use fintech and basically all their invoices go to fintech. and then we send payments to FinTech. But it's sort of, I've never really learned how to use it in a great way. We have like two or three vendors that use them. Some of the big vendors.
Jacob Greenberg: Are you familiar with Baker Distributing? No. Okay. They're one of the larger alcohol liquor distributors and we were talking to them before and they were also using FinTech. So interesting to get the other perspective of it.
Jason Lilly: Do you guys integrate on FinTech at all?
Jacob Greenberg: So for certain projects, my understanding with FinTech and I definitely need to have a firmer understanding before I can speak to it better, is that we would be able to give a process that would replace the invoicing process and payment process for FinTech as far as what FinTech is connecting to, like for the ERP or for the accounting software. What we do is for certain projects we have the ability to build like AI agentic sinks. So it wouldn't be an API, but it's still going to pass the information on. with essentially the exact same outcome, just less less.
Jason Lilly: Got it.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah.
Jason Lilly: Okay, that makes sense.
Jacob Greenberg: All right, cool. So you guys would prefer to do credit card when you have the opportunity to?
Jason Lilly: If it's who pays the fee, us or they do?
Jacob Greenberg: Yes, that's again, we give that control.
Jason Lilly: Yeah, I think typically when we do credit card, yeah, we're paying their bills with our credit card. Yes, I think, yeah, if they charge us a large fee for the credit card, we don't do it. So it just depends. There's going to be some of both.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. All right, cool. I'll show you around really quickly inside the system. This is pretty self-explanatory. We're looking at the summary page here. Once you have some data going, you'll see a chart of your transactions for receivables and payables. and your latest transactions. We bump into here into transactions. It's just a quick high level overview of all the transactions you've had within Nickel. And you can filter by these preset filters above, so receivables. So you can see all the inbound payments if you're accepting payments. You guys are mostly going to be using this for accounts payable though, so you'll be seeing the payables here. If we dive into the payables for a quick second, you'll be able to see your account, what you're linked to, how you're paying it. So whether you're going ACH or if you're using a card, for example, you'll see where it's being sent from or to. You'll have the purpose. So here you will have individual descriptions or if it's a specific invoice, you can enter the invoice number to make it easier for reconciliation purposes in your own accounting software. and the status here. So you can see what's processing, what was canceled, what went out, what hasn't been. You could filter it also by pending completed, so you can see what you're still waiting to send out and what has been sent and settled. Or you could filter by your vendor name and the date that you sent it. So if you're looking up a specific transaction, if you're looking up who you sent it to or the date that you sent it, So this is more of just an overview page. You could download all of this, but when you guys get set up, pop into account settings down here, pop into integrations, you'll be able to link your QuickBooks account. So this is a two-way sync with QuickBooks. Whatever you guys do activity-wise within Nickel will populate on your backend in QuickBooks and vice versa.
Jason Lilly: Got it. Now my first question, and I hope I'm not jumping ahead on that transactions payables, page is how are all of those getting input? How are they getting into nickel?
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, great question. So I will walk you through that process here under the bill pay tab. You cued me up perfectly. So there's two different payments methods here. You could do a new bill, which would be an individual payment. You can even set up your recurring bills as well. So let's start with the individual payment, and then I can walk you through the recurring ones. Okay. So simply click new bill. Now, if you're, if you see these QuickBooks logos here, all of these are accounts that have been synced from the QuickBooks so that like all of our vendor information, the bank account information, contact information that was stored within QuickBooks has been brought over to Nickel. So I could just click on that recipient who I'm paying. and the information's already loaded. If I want to add a new vendor, I could do it very easily through Nickel, and this actually improves the process of collecting vendor information for who you're paying as well. So in the future, if you have somebody else that you're paying, I could type in Jason, add you as a vendor. If I have that information already, I can enter it on my own. But I could also ask my vendor to just fill out their information quickly. I'll type in that information.
Jason Lilly: Oh, that's cool. So they get, okay, you get all the info.
Jacob Greenberg: So they'll get an email that says, and this will be branded obviously for you guys. So it'll say your company name wants to send you money via Nickel. they click this portal, all explanations here, get started, and then whether it's an individual or a contractor, freelancer, or if it's a business that you're going to be sending payments or recurring payments to, they will just securely enter all their payment details here, review and submit, and then that will be stashed on your page in NICOL. So you don't have to worry about like any PCI compliance or security issues. and you can use that information automatically. It will be notified.
Jason Lilly: And new vendors entered in Nickel will sync back to QuickBooks.
Jacob Greenberg: Yep.
Jason Lilly: Got it. Okay, real quick, go back to the new bill for a second. So I get something from, you know, a vendor or whatever. I'm not, oh, there you go. Upload a bill document. So I take a picture of it and put it there.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, so, you know, people in different industries and for different purposes or for different transactions, you might upload different information. The cool thing about this is you're able to have specific documentation on the transaction level. So if you have a recurring payment, you can have the same recurring documents attached to those recurring payments. But if you have a one-off payment, like a one-off agreement, you can upload whatever PDF or whatever document you need. For demo purposes, I the upload sample this, invoice, right? You have an individual invoice, you can upload it there.
Jason Lilly: I mean, that's what we have.
Jacob Greenberg: And.
Jason Lilly: In a new iteration, what would be amazing is you guys have an email that we auto forward all of our invoices to.
Jacob Greenberg: Nice, okay, cool.
Jason Lilly: Right, so that's how like Extra Chef works, that's how Craftable works. is you have an email. So then in Gmail, I set up a forward that says, if I get something from this address, and it automatically.
Jacob Greenberg: Sends it to you.
Jason Lilly: And it has an attachment, and it has this in the subject line, then I want you to forward it to this email address, and then it just shows up here.
Jacob Greenberg: That's a great call out. I mean, that was kind of the biggest highlight for Extra Chef with restaurants is just like easier way to sort through all these invoices that they have inbound.
Jason Lilly: Yeah, except, yeah, I mean, I won't get into Extra Chef, except it didn't work. It just didn't work. And we had to pay have their $500 accounting extra help us a sort.
Jacob Greenberg: Month it to out.
Jason Lilly: Have It was just ridiculous. Yeah, it just wasn't good.
Jacob Greenberg: But yes, ideally that's what you want. You have like a, you're paying five.
Jason Lilly: Out of nowhere, out of nowhere they contact us and say 500 bucks a month and you can get Toast Books. And what Toast Books does basically is all the manual stuff that Extra Chef should do. They're looking at like invoices you've sent in and asking you questions and where do they get categorized and all that. And it's like, that's, this is what we're paying you to do with extra, with, with extra chef.
Jacob Greenberg: So it's just, super is that recently like or was that, we were paying.
Jason Lilly: Them for like a year. We got out of that contract, got away from them, moved into craftable like two months ago.
Jacob Greenberg: Interesting. Yeah. That might have been like a region specific thing they were trying out. Cause I'm not familiar with those books.
Jason Lilly: They were trying it out. They did say it was like something they were trying to, and I think it was because Extra Chef was so bad. Everyone said basically Extra Chef was just kind of cobbled, purchased and cobbled onto it and wasn't. Toast is great. I like toast as a POS. yeah, but all the stuff we've gotten them extra, which is extra Chef and pay payroll, we've gone in a different direction because it's just not a good, it's just, there's a lot better software out there.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah. How are you guys doing payroll these days?
Jason Lilly: We're onboarding with a company called ProLiant.
Jacob Greenberg: ProLiant.
Jason Lilly: That sounds amazing. Like they beat Toast on price and they have HR stuff for us and all this other stuff.
Jacob Greenberg: Oh, sweet. Cool. Good to know. Yeah, here, let me walk you through finishing this create the bill. Okay. For your invoices that you're paying, do you typically have an invoice number that are associated with them? So, okay, cool. So then you'd enter that invoice number. This is going to make it easier for you to track for your own reconciliation purposes. Due date for it, we already uploaded document. And then you make the payment. So then you would select whether you're sending a check, ACH, credit card. Right here we have the credit card associated.
Jason Lilly: Do you guys send checks for us?
Jacob Greenberg: So we are rolling out a beta program for eChecks. I believe we might have a system set up for doing checks manually right now.
Jason Lilly: We don't ever have them, but I'm just curious.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha.
Jason Lilly: So if we charge a credit card, you're charging us 2.9%.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah.
Jason Lilly: If we pay a bill through a credit card. Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: Got it.
Jason Lilly: And then.
Jacob Greenberg: But what I was going.
Jason Lilly: To ask another question.
Jacob Greenberg: We also do checks. We will send checks.
Jason Lilly: Got it. Okay. Okay, you will see checks. Okay. Is there a fee associated with that?
Jacob Greenberg: $2.
Jason Lilly: Okay. Got it.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah. Yeah. So for Bill Pay, it's that process of creating the new bill. For the recurring, here when you click into it, you'll see all of your active recurring ones. And if you want to create a new one, you come down to this bottom right-hand corner. the bill number, the bill purpose. The. Cost, and then you'd schedule it for the recurring cycle. So every month, every week, quarter or year, select the start date and the end date. So there will be an end date associated. If you guys want to renew it, you just come in and update that.
Jason Lilly: Got it.
Jacob Greenberg: Then I'll give you a preview of all of these scheduled payments based on the cadence that you set. And you go ahead and set pay, select your payment method, and it will take care of the rest for you. You can track all of those here in queued for payment, and you can see the ones that have been paid already and paid for full. This is just going to make the reconciliation process a bit easier as well. And.
Jason Lilly: Dumb question, but you are connecting to our bank account?
Jacob Greenberg: Yep, so you enter your bank account information, so it's settling all the payments for you.
Jason Lilly: Okay. Got it. And so in that get paid, is that where we see, are we seeing transactions that have come in through our bank account?
Jacob Greenberg: Get paid is accounts receivable. So if you are requesting payments from anybody here or sending out invoices, this tool is for like AR operations.
Jason Lilly: Got it. So this is the same, it functions the same way as Bill Pay, right? You're just creating a new invoice or recurring invoice.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah.
Jason Lilly: Do you guys have a new invoice or service payment?
Jacob Greenberg: Would you guys have a need for like an accounts receivable tool?
Jason Lilly: No, I don't think we do.
Jacob Greenberg: We don't, maybe like catering events or something or like custom private events. It's kind of the only thing I think of.
Jason Lilly: Yeah, they kind of do through Toast, we can do deposits for that kind of stuff. So I don't think really think we would have a, a need for that as of right now.
Jacob Greenberg: Cool. Yeah, if you wanted to, the system is pretty much the same. This side, instead of responding to invoices, you're creating them. It's a pretty cool tool, but I'll show you it while we're here just so that you understand what it is, because this will live within your system once you sign up. So if you ever have the need for it, you can go ahead and utilize it. You can set up invoice types for recurring or once as well. notes for customers and attach that custom PDF. On this side.
Jason Lilly: And this is not creating an invoice. I'm creating the invoice like in QuickBooks or something.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah. Well, you could do either way. So you could create the invoice here and it would sync. So. Let'S do invoice number 101. But most commonly people do generate it out of their accounting system and then use this for the bill pay operation and make sure that it's synced up.
Jason Lilly: Got it.
Jacob Greenberg: If you click into Advanced here, you can see that you can accept or disable credit card payments. You can allow the customer to edit the payment amount. So if you have, you know, a private event or something and you want to accept a deposit or something like that through the system, you'll be able to enable this so that they could pay either incrementally or choose to pay part of it via credit card. This is our office mascot in the background. oh. And you can also customize fees. So if you are accepting payments for accounts receivable, you know, some industrial companies will, most people put the entire credit card processing on the customer that's paying because you're giving them the option to pay with ACH or with credit card. And if they elect to pay with credit card, they're incurring the fee. But we do have some customers that will have specific arrangements with their clients where they'll take you know, 25% of the fee or 50% of the fee. And you can customize that here.
Jason Lilly: Got it.
Jacob Greenberg: Then when you create the link, it will send via email. So I just sent it to myself and it will look like this. So. I have a new payment request. I pop in and click pay. This will be branded for your restaurant or for your company. There's the option to pay by card, to pay by bank, you can pay by check as well if you enable that. The fee will be associated and automatically calculated into the final total. Any PDF will be embedded here as well. And you can see any unpaid invoices that I have with that person. So, you know, obviously I've had a lot of tests done here, but you guys are going to mostly live in the AP side. within Nickel. Yeah, it's good just to show you just in case you wanted to. And a quicker, easier way is we also have this payment portal where it's just a quick payment method to you guys. So some of our customers will like embed this on the website or put this on a QR code. We're coming out with a new product as well. That makes it easy to pay on the phone, like tap a credit card on your phone and it will pay. Cool. Yeah. But this is pretty short.
Jason Lilly: How long have you guys been around?
Jacob Greenberg: About three and a half years. Okay. Yeah.
Jason Lilly: And customer service, do I get to talk to individuals?
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah. All we have are individuals and they're all here in this office.
Jason Lilly: There's the house mascot.
Jacob Greenberg: Nice. Aw, cutie. Cool. Yeah, we're all here. If you have any questions or need support, feel free to Reach out to us. There's a help center here. When you send a message, it goes straight to our development team and our support staff. And if you need any extra assistance, feel free to shoot me an email as well. My email is on the calendar invite. Cool.
Jason Lilly: Well, listen, this sounds great. I think I'll sign up for the free version of it, get it all set up, and see where we go from there. And just use it a little bit and see how it comes together. But Yeah, I actually like how just stripped down and simple it is right now, right? That's exactly what I need. I get all the invoices, so it's easy for me to take a picture and enter them and then just have.
Jacob Greenberg: Them all in one place of everything that's due. Yeah, frankly, Jason, I feel like for your use case and my experience with this is like having an easy bill pay system for all the different software that restaurants have for inventory and invoicing and stuff. It's like kind of a mess. And I know that for Extra Chef, like the bill pay thing was like the thing that everyone always talked about coming out and like This never really seems came like out a in really an plug-in, efficient plug way. and play type of solution for your specific need. So I think it should work fine. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out and let me know.
Jason Lilly: I will.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah. Cool, man.
Jason Lilly: I appreciate it. Awesome. Thank you for your time, Jacob.
Jacob Greenberg: Final piece is if you do refer a business, get a $250 bonus. You could send them a URL or you could message me directly for an introduction. I'm happy to get them set up. okay.
Jason Lilly: Sounds good, man. How many people do you guys have on your team?
Jacob Greenberg: We have about 15 people right now on the team.
Jason Lilly: I love that, man. I just signed up a. An AI voice receptionist.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah.
Jason Lilly: And to answer our phone and literally had this call with them yesterday, signed up today. When you go on, like, Reddit and look, I mean, there are a thousand. There's so many of those. It's ridiculous.
Jacob Greenberg: What's the.
Jason Lilly: But these guys worked with.
Jacob Greenberg: What are they?
Jason Lilly: It's called, it's called Hey Libby, Hey Libby, L-I-B-B-Y. And it's seven guys in, it's perfect, it's simple, it's 50 bucks a month, and it's seven guys in, in Seattle.
Jacob Greenberg: Nice.
Jason Lilly: And so it's sort of the same thing where you're just getting, you know, it's just, it's what we need. We don't need a lot of complicated conversations back and forth and all of that. We just need, you know, people call and they always answer the same questions and so I asked the same questions. I just want somebody to, you know, Somebody to take care of that. But anyways, I like the concept of a small team that's building and pays attention to you, you know, because I'll definitely give you guys some feedback.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, for sure. Feel free to drop us a line. Shoot me an email also is probably the best way to make sure that it's getting to the right place. Okay. But yeah, I, back when I did like a trade show a year and a half ago with Toast, there was a, the booth next to us was somebody developing a tool like that, like a AI phone receptionist. For responses. And he keeps messaging me about trying to figure out like a model for the business and they're developing and apparently they have like really great AI, but he like wanted to charge like $2,500 a month or like take 30% of the orders and I oh my goodness. I'm like, Ed, most people can create a product like this very easy. It's like, especially now with all these AI agents.
Jason Lilly: I've watched a few videos and I was that close to going into 11 labs creating a support chat bot. And then my hard part was just trying to figure out how to tie it into my phone number. And then at some point, I'm like, you know what? For 50 bucks a month, suck it. I can, you know, it's worth it.
Jacob Greenberg: To have somebody who's got something produced for me and a team that can help me. Yeah, yeah. I mean, 50 bucks a month sounds much more reasonable. Yeah, for sure. Restaurant margins are thin. It's crazy to try to charge someone a percentage of their business. That's why I have like, I have very, a very specific strong feelings about like third party delivery apps. in general. And I'm just like that model has to shift from charging for a percentage, like taking a percentage of commission per order. Yeah, it's got to change.
Jason Lilly: For sure. For sure.
Jacob Greenberg: All right, Jason, it was great to meet you.
Jason Lilly: Nice meeting you as well. I'll be in touch for sure. Thank you so much.
Jacob Greenberg: You guys have a great one. You too.
Jason Lilly: All right, bye.
