Colton O'Farrell: Hey Jerry and looks like we have a carlee on as well.
jerry: Yes, I did. She does all of our accounting and all payroll stuff, so she needs to be on here as well.
Colton O'Farrell: So. Awesome. Well, Jerry, carlee, it's a pleasure to meet you. Just introduce myself. My name is Colton. I work on the customer success team here at Nickel and we'll be your. Customer Success Manager. So really happy that we were able to make some time to meet today. I just wanted to go over a little bit kind of of the purpose of this call agenda and what we're hoping to accomplish. So really the purpose of this call is to one, introduce ourselves to each other, discuss your onboarding with Nickel. We have 30 minutes here.
jerry: Does that still work for you both?
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, that works fine for me.
carlee: Awesome. Can you hear me?
Colton O'Farrell: I don't know if you can hear me. Yes, I can hear you.
carlee: Can you hear me? Yeah. Sorry, perfect.
Colton O'Farrell: No worries. Yeah, it always is little minor zoom technical difficulties. I totally understand that. So Jerry, I understand you and your wife are the business owners of Custom Homes, Triple M in Texas. Yes. And then Colton O'Farrell is doing some of the bookkeeping for you? Yes. Okay, awesome. Well, really just to cover the agenda today, so really for the call, I'll be sharing some details of my role as your Customer Success Manager. What I know about your business already and then give an opportunity for you to fill in any gaps for me. The outcome by the end of this call is we're going to select one of three onboarding packages that Nickel offers for free. So those are a one week, one month or one quarter onboarding depending on your preferred timeline. And then we will book a follow up call to review any of your invoice transactions or bills that you've paid. But does that sound like a fair agenda for today's call? Sure. Awesome. Well, as your Sales Partner, I'll help by offering trainings, integration support, and just an overall smooth onboarding experience. So once we get off this call as well, I'll provide you some resources for how to best use Nickel, and in particular for your unique use cases. Like I mentioned, we do offer those three onboarding plans. And before we kind of select one that makes the most sense for you guys, Is there anything that I should know about your timeline for using Nickel and kind of when you are hoping to be up and running?
jerry: Carlee, you got anything there?
carlee: No, I don't think, I mean, I think we want to start pretty soon, right?
jerry: Yeah, we definitely want to start as soon as we can. I mean, the QuickBook fees have been a big issue, you know, so.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah. And on those fees, can you tell me a little bit more of what you're paying? It's kind of crazy. They have some pretty Different ranges, I've heard some customers paying 1%, some paying 2%, sometimes it's capped, sometimes it's uncapped. What do they have for you guys?
jerry: We're at 1%.
Colton O'Farrell: Is that capped or uncapped today?
jerry: It's uncapped.
Colton O'Farrell: Uncapped, okay.
jerry: Yeah, so I mean, this year so far, I mean, we've paid about $32,000 in fees.
Colton O'Farrell: Wow. Yeah. And so when you're sending those invoices from QuickBooks Online, can you just walk me through a little bit of that process? I looked at your guys' kind of your website. I was looking at some of your customer reviews. Obviously know that you have contractors and subcontractors that you have to pay for some of these homes that you're building. Wanted to ask a little bit more on that AR and AP kind of standpoint that you have. Oh, can you hear me okay, Carly?
jerry: You there, Carly?
Colton O'Farrell: We can hear you. Let's see, I'll put it in the chat. Sometimes if it's being a little finicky, she can always leave and rejoin. Awesome.
jerry: I know one of the issues we had. So we had used another platform before trying to again save on some of these fees. But the way, you know, same thing, everything's sunk up with QuickBooks.
Colton O'Farrell: Which platform was that, if you don't mind me asking?
jerry: Build.com.
Colton O'Farrell: Build.com, yep. Yeah.
jerry: But she had an issue with the way it was being recorded automatically when it's sunk up with QuickBooks. So it made for her to have to do a little more work.
Colton O'Farrell: What were some of those? And this was Carly. I know she just left, so she's probably rejoining. Do you, but if you know what she was kind of dealing with, it.
jerry: Had not in particular. Hang on. Let me, she says she's trying to get back.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep. No worries.
jerry: Let me, let me just call her real quick.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah. You can always put her on speaker on your end as well. It's better. Oh, looks like she just joined actually. Oh, yep. Can you hear us okay now? Yes.
carlee: I don't know what happened. Were y'all still all there and I was the only one gone?
Colton O'Farrell: Yep. No worries. It totally, it happens all the time. So no problem. Jerry was just telling me a little bit about the experience that you had when y'all were set up with bill.com and had that integrated with QuickBooks. It sounds like there was some additional work that was required. Was hoping you could talk a little bit more about some of those specific use cases and challenges.
carlee: Sure, yeah. No, it came, it wasn't automatically.
Colton O'Farrell: It.
carlee: Went into a money in clearing account versus when the invoices were, Like right now, if we do an invoice in QuickBooks, then we're able to instantly match it once it comes in and is paid. When it comes in through QuickBooks, or I mean through bill.com, it came in in a multi-step process that never really made sense to me, I guess.
Colton O'Farrell: Like when you say, multi-step process, is this for AR, AP, both?
carlee: Well, both really. I mean, I guess I just would, my ideal thought, and hopefully there's a way to make this happen, would be like when we send out an invoice through your website, does it create an invoice in QuickBooks or do we do a separate invoice?
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, great question. Yeah, so what you'll want to do, I'm just looking into your account right now. Awesome. You are integrated with your QuickBooks. You've sent out that first invoice, was paid. Looks like Howard Baldwin. Okay, awesome. What you'll do in your case, you are integrated with QuickBooks Online. What that means is Nickel has a native integration. Whatever is done in QuickBooks Online will update in Nickel. Whatever is done in Nickel will update in QuickBooks Online. What you're going to do is you are going to continue to create your invoices and QuickBooks Online. You know what it says when you generated the invoice? There's kind of two different options. It says save the invoice or it says review and send. That sound familiar? Yeah. You're always going to want to do the save, save the invoice. So once you save that within nickel, you can either one log into the platform and here, let me just. Get into my demo account.
carlee: I don't think, I mean, Jerry, like we never found a way to connect the two successfully with bill.com, like invoice invoice or receiving payments. It was always received through bill and it went into a different account on QuickBooks. And you had to clear that out, journal entry, deposit to the other.
Colton O'Farrell: We definitely don't, I've heard that process and set up from other customers. We've gotten a lot of people who've switched over from Bill to Nickel. We are not set up that way, so I just logged into my demo account here. I'm not actually connected to a QuickBooks account here, but I do have a screenshot and you guys could log into your account to see What that looks like. Let me just grab that screenshot. So I wanted to ask, so yours will look similar to this. It will say your name, it will have your QuickBooks number. I know there's one other field in between there that is your chart of accounts. But what you're going to do is, so there's two different kind of options here. So you're always going to save that invoice in QuickBooks Online, like I mentioned. But if you are generally creating an invoice and once it's created, you don't need to make edits to it. Change the amount, do any kind of revisions. If that invoice is generally pretty static and can be sent off to the customer, if you want to reduce some steps on your end, you can turn on this automate payment links. So what this does is anytime you hit that save button within QuickBooks, Nickel will just automatically send that invoice to your customer either via email or via SMS, whatever you have listed as the right response. You always want to save the invoice because if you hit review and send on QuickBooks' end, your customer is essentially going to get two invoices. But if you just save that invoice, you have this turned on, it's going to be automatically sent to your customer. However, I mentioned it's not good, it's only good to have that on if it's a pretty static amount and you don't need to change those invoices. Because if you need to make edits or revisions to that invoice, your customer, if that automation is turned on, they would get an email for each of those changes that you made. So in the event that that automation is turned off, maybe because you do need to make more of those changes, all you would need to do is come into Nickel right here, your invoices would all be brought in, they would have a QuickBooks logo next to them, and you would simply hit this request payment button. It would send this secure payment link right here, either via to this email or to a phone number via a text message, if you have that as well. But your customer will get an email that will be sent directly to them. This is just me copying and pasting that one in there. So they'll get an email saying, hey, we have a new invoice for Triple M. Here's that invoice. They'll click the pay now option and they'll be, they can either do the pay by card with their bank account via ACH for no fee, or they can pay with a credit card with that 2.99% fee added. Perfect. Okay.
carlee: And does that 2.99 go for debit cards also, or just credit cards?
Colton O'Farrell: It is debit and credit card. So any kind of card. If I would recommend pushing customers away from using a debit card just because there's no real benefit in them. They're not getting like a 45 day float. They're not getting like credit card points. So I would always suggest doing the ACA ACH option. We also have an account settings too. You do have full control over that card rate. So on the accounts receivable side, by default, 100% of that credit card fee is to be paid for by the customer. Our floss fee is if your customer wants to pay their bill with a credit card, either for that float or for those credit card points, they should be responsible for paying that fee. However, you do have complete control here. So this is a global rule. You can adjust this to be any percentage that you'd like. And this would affect all invoices moving forward. If you wanted to eat the cost fully, you could do that. But by default, again, 100% of the cost will be covered by your customer. You can also come in on an individual customer level as well as an invoice level. So let's see, we'll just grab this one. If you wanted to override that global rule, you can come in here just for this particular customer. We'll split the fee 50/50. Or if you wanted to just for one invoice, you can always come into an invoice. Come in here, you can go to our settings on that invoice. And there, I believe that you will be a Nickel Plus user just given the invoice amounts for some of the homes that you're building. But you will, if you are a Nickel Plus member, you will have these same options. So you could disable credit card payments altogether. You can allow the customer to make a partial fee. So if it's a thousand dollars and they want to pay 500, you turn this on and allow them to do that. If you want them to pay the full amount in full, you could turn that off. And if you want to override the invoice, the global rules for that card fee, you can come in here on just an invoice level and override that as well. Questions with any of that?
jerry: None for me, no.
Colton O'Farrell: Cool. And then I did not see on your website, you don't currently have a customer payment portal, right? They're mostly paying you via QuickBooks. Are you getting a lot of checks as well?
jerry: Now we don't handle a lot of checks. Basically, for the most part, not always, there are times where we will directly invoice a customer. Maybe it's a change order or just something like that. If it's outside of the contract agreement, we'll send them an invoice directly to pay. However, 95% of the times what we're doing is creating an invoice in QuickBooks for a draw amount that we're making. And then we're submitting that draw to their lender who's funding the build. So we receive wire transfers from the actual lender itself.
Colton O'Farrell: I gotcha. Yeah. Awesome. Well, something else I wanted to talk about. So obviously in QuickBooks, you're generating an invoice. Nickel would be sending that to your customer either via email, via SMS. They pay that with their bank and ACH. There's no fee for you or for your customers. They want to pay via card, they obviously can do that. It gives your customers more options to pay their bills, but you're not going to be responsible for paying any of that card fee. Something else I wanted to show you though as well is every customer when you set up with a Nickel account, you get access to this customer payment portal. So that can be found right here in the Get Paid tab. It's right here, this payments portal. This is completely customizable. So you just come into settings right here, you'd upload a banner, it's going to reflect the branded logo that you added and your information here. But what this does is it really serves as for most of our customers as a backup method or as a one-stop shop for any customer to come in and make any kind of payment. Most of our customers will take this link and they will either embed it in their website. So just having an option for customers to come in to make a payment. But this still has the same options that you would have if your customer was clicking on an individual invoice. So they come in here, they could pay any kind of amount. A lot of them would list for the reason the invoice number. They would list their bank information there and say that and click pay. There's no fee with that. Or if they want to go ahead and do a card, they can also do that here. It's just going to have that 2.99% fee. This is something that, like I said, generally most customers will have as a backup method. They will embed it in their website. Something else. Do you ever have people collect, trying to collect payment in person. I think I had seen in some of the reviews, maybe, are you just showing up to pick up checks sometimes, Jerry? No. No. Is there anybody that goes in person to request any kind of payments or is it all mostly just the QuickBooks?
jerry: No, no, that's really not happened in many years.
Colton O'Farrell: Okay, I gotcha. I just wanted to mention that because in addition to putting this into your website, something that a lot of our customers do is they'll go to They can put this in a QR code. If I went to this website, qr.io, throw that payment portal link in here. This QR code, if you were to scan this with your phone, this would take you directly to the website here, directly here. Some of our customers, if they have paper invoices, they'll just add that QR code as a template to their invoices to allow a customer to make electronic payment if they have to send it via paper. Some of the guys who are showing up in person doing work on homes, they might have the QR code just on their phone where a customer can scan it and make some kind of payment. Or if you want to just continue to, you know, send invoices via Nickel and send those, you can find some in my demo account here. Or if you want to continue just to send an invoice via email like this, it would just say custom homes. By Triple M LLC. A new payment request here. It's for this advisor. Put a memo in there. The nice thing that what we do as well is if there's any attachments in QuickBooks Online, we'll automatically just grab those and pull them in here. But again, if your customer receives that, they would just hit this pay now button and then be brought to this screen with those two options. But yeah, any questions with any of those thoughts on if it's Yeah, just curious kind of on overall feedback and what you're thinking if any of this would really apply to you guys.
jerry: I mean, I've already kind of gone through this, through the website. It seems really pretty cut and dry to me. It seems really simple.
Colton O'Farrell: Awesome.
jerry: The main thing was how is Carlee going to see it in QuickBooks? Is it going to be seamless where it can easily be reconciled, you know?
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, great question. Because we have that native integration, and I can stop sharing here, it generally is a real time update within QuickBooks. There might be a few seconds type of delay, but it is a real whatever is done in Nickel will update in QuickBooks online and vice versa. Because we have that native integration, we have a lot of control into the syncing of data there. Something else that Nickel does that I don't believe Bill bill does is that we treat every payment as their own atomic unit. So we are never doing batch processing or waiting for a batch of invoices to come in before we process those. As soon as that invoice has been paid, or if you're paying a bill via Nickel, we are instantly processing that. And so you could even if you had 50 invoices with one customer that all came out on the same day, we're going to treat those each as their individual atomic unit so that we have that very easy one-to-one reconciliation between you, your customers and your banks. Okay.
jerry: Carly, have you looked into QuickBooks since we've did that? We sent that out to the Wolf's because we received the payment on.
carlee: Right, I did. And it didn't. That's what I was, my question was, was when I go to integrate, when, like you said, you don't have a QuickBooks to connect that to, but when we When I go to link the two together, because I don't know that ours are linked right now, Jerry, let me see. I'm on our.
Colton O'Farrell: From what I could see that it was linked. Do you have multiple QuickBooks accounts or just one?
jerry: Just one.
Colton O'Farrell: Just one. Cool. Yeah, I did see that it was connected to a QuickBooks account. And then within your QuickBooks account, do you have one chart of accounts?
carlee: Do you have multiple? Well, that's what I was wondering. Like if I could click, what.
Colton O'Farrell: Account.
carlee: It goes to in the chart of accounts. Is it possible that it is somewhere else in the chart of accounts?
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah. Do you want to log in and share your screen quick?
carlee: I can. Let me see one second.
Colton O'Farrell: I do also have access on mine. Oh, let's sign on this one.
carlee: Now you're asking me to get all techie here. We're not that techie. Hold on. Let me see how to do this. No worries. I don't even know how to share my screen. Let me figure this out.
Colton O'Farrell: It's the green button at the bottom.
carlee: Can you hear me?
Colton O'Farrell: I can, yep, yes.
carlee: Suddenly I can't hear you. Unmute, hold on.
Colton O'Farrell: Okay.
carlee: I cannot hear y'all.
jerry: Can you not hear us?
Colton O'Farrell: Testing. Just cutting out again. Interesting. Hold on.
carlee: I'm gonna come back. I'm gonna log out and come back because it was working that way.
Colton O'Farrell: Okay. Yep. No worries. Sorry about that.
jerry: Let me do this. I can log in real quick.
Colton O'Farrell: Awesome. Thank you.
carlee: Can y'all hear me now?
Colton O'Farrell: Yes. Can you hear us?
carlee: Yes, finally. Okay. Oh, share. Here. Let me get you the right one. I got too many things. Jerry got me this new fancy computer and it's too fancy for me almost.
Colton O'Farrell: If you need me. I can do it, Colton.
carlee: Okay, yeah, you do it and then I can just tell you what I'm talking about. Yeah, you don't mind.
Colton O'Farrell: And Carlee, what is your last name just for adding it into our system and records? It sounds like you'll be one of the main users on the account.
carlee: Yes, K-U-E-N-S.
Colton O'Farrell: I see it here. Yep, you've added it, perfect.
carlee: Okay.
Colton O'Farrell: That's the accounting@customhomes.com best address for you.
carlee: Yes, that's fine.
Colton O'Farrell: Cool.
carlee: Okay, so can y'all see mine now? Did it work?
Colton O'Farrell: Yes, you can see your screen.
carlee: Okay, so let me go up here. Okay, so this is how it came in on ours. You see it didn't like and it says it's from Ken, but it doesn't put it anywhere, if that makes sense.
Colton O'Farrell: When you say put it somewhere, what do you mean?
carlee: Well, I mean like it doesn't, I don't see any sort of connection to Nickel. I see a deposit, but there should be an invoice, I'm assuming.
Colton O'Farrell: So Nickel is not sending, we're not generating an invoice. We are taking the one that is created in QuickBooks Online as well as like the attachment. And we're sending that off to your customer. But we are not generating like an invoice within Nickel.
carlee: We're just, I bet it happened because I think Jerry generally.
Colton O'Farrell: Oh, did we lose your audio? Oh, oh, there it's back.
carlee: It would only go if we generated it. Oh my gosh. What?
jerry: Generated it in QuickBooks, yes.
carlee: Okay, so here it is.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep.
carlee: And it says paid. But I'm just saying over here on the transactions, usually it would connect the same amount here with.
Colton O'Farrell: If you want to pull up your Nickel platform, I can show you kind of where. So perfect. So if you go to the get paid tab on the left, Yep. And then go to completed. And then click into the top one with Ken Wolfe there. And then if you scroll down and select, so you can see the files that, let's see, all the files right there. And if you hit this little eye emoji thing, you'll be able to actually open up any of those and see the images that we pulled in.
carlee: Sure. But my, I mean, I guess I just feel like QuickBooks should recognize that the same dollar amount was deposited and usually it will come up recognizing it if any other invoice is paid with the same dollar amount. Like it would connect those two and I could match them. So some way, somehow I have to be able to connect this payment with that invoice, if that makes sense.
Colton O'Farrell: Connect this payment with that invoice. And so they're not connected. You're saying that you're not seeing that it's been completed on the QuickBooks side or where is the just for me relating to like our invoice team?
carlee: Okay, so none of these. Let me just see if there's any over here.
Colton O'Farrell: Also, I wanted to ask as well, just for our own kind of understanding of processing accounts, obviously is a financial institution important for us to know how much kind of money that we'd be processing for you. Jerry, do you guys have an understanding on both your accounts receivable side, what kind of funds or invoices amounts you'd be sending through Nickel, as well as if you're looking to pay your contractors through Nickel? If you have an idea from a revenue perspective of funds that you'd be processing through Nickel?
jerry: We won't be making payments through Nickel.
Colton O'Farrell: You'll be just doing the accounts receivable? Yes. And what from the accounts receivable side, what are you expecting to process in terms of revenue through Nickel?
jerry: This year we'll do about 4 million.
Colton O'Farrell: Okay.
jerry: So the mass majority of that would go through Nickel.
Colton O'Farrell: I gotcha. That sounds great. From the accounts payable perspective, what are you doing for paying your contractors today? Is that a separate system? How is that working for you?
jerry: We typically pay most contractors through our e-check system, so electronic checks.
Colton O'Farrell: Okay, nice. Any fees or anything on that?
jerry: No, there's not.
Colton O'Farrell: Okay. Yeah, there's no fees through that. I mean, don't see why you need to change that, but I just wanted to let you know as well. You can pay bills with Nickel. As a customer being set up, you have access to both the AR and AP side of things. If you pay bills with ACH, there's no fees for you or for your customers as well. It's only when there's a, if you're paying bills with a credit card, then there's a 2.90% fee. But you do have access to that as well. Okay. Cool. I know we just lost Carly. She'll probably be popping back here in just a moment, but I wanted to save some time. So like I had mentioned kind of on the front end, generally at Nickel, we have three different onboarding plans. We have a one week plan, we have a one month plan, and we have like a one quarter or a three month plan. Sounds like you guys are leaning more towards the one week to one month being up and running trained and just have it running a smooth, kind of smooth sailing here on out? Are we looking to do the one month onboarding plan? Do we want to do the one month? What makes the most sense there?
jerry: Well, I went in the other day and signed up for, I think it's the plus plan, the middle plan.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep.
jerry: And so we've got signed up for that, which was whatever, 35.
Colton O'Farrell: Do we want to throw on then a meeting for, do the one week plan and throw a meeting on for a week from today to review the transactions, just make sure everything's working as it should. Is supposed is supposed to or do we want a little more time than that?
jerry: I'd say maybe a couple give us a couple weeks.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, let's do the one month onboarding plan then.
jerry: Yeah, and we need to like I.
Colton O'Farrell: Said.
jerry: And I don't know if she's back in yet. Colton, you back here?
carlee: Yes, I'm trying to see if I can make this work while you're here. Sorry, I was there, there. This is what I'm talking about.
Colton O'Farrell: One match found, okay.
carlee: And so now, I find. I got it. I figured it out.
jerry: It was.
Colton O'Farrell: What was. Yeah, we're just curious. What was not.
carlee: Did you have to go up here and went to the payment. It was going into allowance for bad debts. It was deposited there.
Colton O'Farrell: The reason it's doing that, if you go back into your Nickel account, go to settings. Account settings on the. Oh, sorry. At the. The bottom left down here. And then Integrations. Yes. If you go to the Integrations Tab and then if you see that one right there, that's the chart of accounts that it's connected.
carlee: That's what I was trying. That was my question. That's what I was trying to make.
Colton O'Farrell: Sure that it got deposited in.
jerry: What was that checking? What was that checking account? I didn't recognize that.
carlee: The Chase checking 2025.
jerry: That's not our account number though.
carlee: That's the one that we use for all the.
jerry: I'm used to seeing the last four digits of the account number so.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep, this is just the nickname. Okay, gotcha. Cool. Well, it sounds like.
carlee: Can you hear me?
Colton O'Farrell: Yep, yes. Can you hear us? You might have. Well, so I'm thinking what makes the most sense. So we'll do the one month onboarding plan. Let's see. So you're in Texas, you're in Central Time, it looks like. Do we want to do a meeting on October 14?
carlee: Are you there?
Colton O'Farrell: Yep. Yes. Do we want to schedule a meeting for October 14th at 11 A.M. central time? It'd be a 30 minute meeting, reviewing the transactions, anything else that has come up in the meantime, making sure that we're all set up and ready to run as kind of normal. Does that work for us?
jerry: Yeah, that's good for me.
Colton O'Farrell: Perfect. So I'm going to go ahead and shoot that second call over to you. If you both want to just accept that so I know that you got it.
carlee: And I will make sure that these technical difficult. I'll call the Triple M IT department and see what is going on.
Colton O'Farrell: No worries whatsoever. No, it happens. More often than you can imagine. So no worries. I'm going to go ahead and just shoot the invite if you want to let me know that you got that. And before I let you go here, is there any questions, anything that we did not cover that you want to just double check on?
carlee: I just want to make sure that I understand real quick that we're still continuing to create the invoices first in QuickBooks and not in.
Colton O'Farrell: Do you want to pull up your QuickBooks again and like just create like a dummy invoice and I can show you just the make sure it's you're always saving that option rather than hitting the review and send. You will never.
jerry: And we again, we rarely ever hit the send. We just.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah.
jerry: So yeah.
Colton O'Farrell: So it sounds like it won't be much of a change in your process.
carlee: Okay. That's what I just wanted to make sure we were doing them from the right spot.
jerry: Send it to me.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah.
carlee: Yeah, so.
Colton O'Farrell: Perfect. So I've sent those invites. If you just want to let me know if you both have received it.
carlee: One second. So then let's see. Okay, so. So you're saying this save and close here?
Colton O'Farrell: Yes, that is good. That's your best friend with Nickel. The one on the far right is your new nemesis. So do not click that one.
carlee: Okay.
Colton O'Farrell: So.
carlee: Open balance, a dollar. So then I should be able to go up here.
jerry: Should we see it Nickel?
carlee: Yeah, look, Jerry, you see there?
jerry: Yep, I got it.
carlee: Okay.
Colton O'Farrell: Awesome. And then, Jerry, did you get the invite for October 16th? Oh, it looks like I maybe lost your audio.
jerry: Yes, I did receive it.
Colton O'Farrell: Okay, perfect. Yeah. And Colton, I sent that to you as well if you got that. If you both just want to, when you have a moment, want to make sure you confirm that meeting just because my schedule tends to fill up quite quickly with meetings and I have an automatic AI thing that's reviewing if there's no meetings attended from external parties, it just automatically declines that. So if you want to just make sure you accept that, that'd be perfect. What we're going to do on that call is we're going to review all of your transactions. We're going to review the integration flow. If there's any additional trainings that need to be done, or as you've been working with Nickel for that month, you're like, Hey, I would really love this feature. That's for us to talk about that, the impact, and to get that sent over to our engineering team just to any quality of life improvements that we could do for you. Okay. Awesome. Well, Jerry, Carly, it was a pleasure meeting you both today. I appreciate you going over a little bit on the call here. What I'm going to be doing after this call is I'm going to send us before end of day today a follow-up meeting just with some additional resources and helpful links for using Nickel. I'll also put in there just our timeline and kind of onboarding schedule. You guys have completed a lot of it, which is great. You just need to make sure you're sending transactions, testing out the platform, which it sounds like you're already doing. So. Okay.
carlee: Well, Jerry, I'll have to give me the rundown. I'm so sorry.
Colton O'Farrell: I'm back again. That's all good. No worries. I just wanted to thank you both for your time today, Carly. I said I'll be sending a follow up to you and Jerry as well before end of day today with some helpful resources and links. If anything else comes up, always feel free to reach out to me. I am in meetings a lot of the time though, so I did want to also urge you to reach out to the Help Center within the app. So if you click the Help Center, it brings you up to a message thread. If you communicate in that thread, it goes to like eight people on our team that of different departments where they can review it quickly. Send it over to who needs to answer that first. And generally we're able to get those responses within like eight minutes versus I might be in meetings back to back most of the day. So just wanted to call that out. But again, pleasure meeting you. And we're really excited to be sort of supporting your business. Thank you for your time.
carlee: Awesome. All right.
Colton O'Farrell: Thank you so much.
carlee: Appreciate y'all. Bye bye. All right. Bye bye.
