Colton O'Farrell: Hello.
Deshyra Hubbard: I can't hear you.
Colton O'Farrell: Can't hear me?
Deshyra Hubbard: Oh, I hear you now.
Colton O'Farrell: Perfect. How's it going?
Deshyra Hubbard: Good.
Colton O'Farrell: How are you doing really well? Other than we have severe thunderstorms right now in Chicago. So if you hear a little bit background noise, it's that. So you're based out of Atlanta?
Deshyra Hubbard: Yes, but I'm in Ohio right now for. A franchise thing.
Colton O'Farrell: Oh, very cool. And nice to meet you. It's pronounced Deshyra.
Deshyra Hubbard: It's Deshyra.
Colton O'Farrell: Nice to meet you, Deshyra. Colton, I'm here on the sales team at Nickel. Happy to be speaking with you today. I saw your note on the form that you filled out. So it looks like you guys are yourself. You're using QuickBooks for processing of new business app acquisition process feels a little clunky. There's some high ACH fees. Curious, are you paying like one to two percent there when it comes to ACH fees?
Deshyra Hubbard: I believe so. Like if I, let's say every week I do 50,000, 55,000 of invoicing, they're charging me like 500 per week.
Colton O'Farrell: Is there a cap with that? Do you know?
Deshyra Hubbard: I think it's capped at 10.
Colton O'Farrell: Okay. But when you're doing 90% of those, obviously you're paying hundreds or thousands of dollars to just get money into your bank account. So can understand how that's a little frustrating. I know we certainly could help there. I'm happy to pop into the platform and show you that. But before we do that, just wanted to learn a little bit more about what you're doing on the AR and AP side. If you have any other use cases besides the ones you've listed there, I just want to see how if Nickel could most support your business, if that makes sense.
Deshyra Hubbard: Yeah. So I just acquired this business a week ago. It's been a while.
Colton O'Farrell: Congratulations.
Deshyra Hubbard: Thank you. It's been in the process for the last six months and I'm obligated to use QuickBooks Online per this franchise, like for record keeping, but I don't have to use them for payment processor. But so the process right now is it's a home care business. So there's a system called Teletrack that I have to use. that tracks like the caregivers hours, like the jobs they worked. Right?
Colton O'Farrell: Right.
Deshyra Hubbard: So I take the the format from there, the invoicing and it invoices to QuickBooks. So QuickBooks will calculate, you know, the money in each individual invoice.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep.
Deshyra Hubbard: And then like, yeah, so that's I have to use that. That's not something that can go away. And then going into QuickBooks. And maybe I honestly forgot your question, but that that process is Is still getting worked out and fine, but usually the old seller would use the desktop version of QuickBooks. It's not an option for me. And for some reason on that one, they only charge them $2 per transaction. Right. Yeah, and I didn't know about it. But you're on the online version, right?
Colton O'Farrell: I'm on the online version.
Deshyra Hubbard: Well, to be honest, that works better.
Colton O'Farrell: For you to work with us because we have a native integration with QuickBooks Online, QuickBooks Desktop. We don't have an API built out for that. If anything, it's better for you there. So just to confirm this, you're speaking with Nickel regarding Hubbard North America Incorporated, or is it your own? I know that you also have your own company. Is that separate from this? It's just regarding the company that you acquired like a week ago?
Deshyra Hubbard: Yeah, I have two separate QuickBooks. I'm just talking about the one for Hubbard North America.
Colton O'Farrell: Just Hubbard North America. Okay, cool. Just wanted to clarify that. Awesome. No, that process makes sense. You're not doing anything in terms of credit cards. Processing or people asking you to if they can pay via credit card, do you have a process for that?
Deshyra Hubbard: So I think she only has two clients right now that do credit cards. Most of it is ACH. So like out of the 70, is it 70? Yeah, around 60-70 clients, like 98% of them are ACH.
Colton O'Farrell: Okay. And it doesn't really matter for us on our end because your customers will be equipped to pay either or whatever makes the most sense for them. Just curious what you have in place today for those two customers. who do pay a credit card? What does that look like? Are you eating the fee? I mean, I know you're newer to this business since you just acquired it, but did you know if they were eating the fees or how that kind of works?
Deshyra Hubbard: She charges them 3.5% and just puts it on the invoice when she runs.
Colton O'Farrell: The credit card in QuickBooks. Got it.
Deshyra Hubbard: So just kind of adds it as like a line item.
Colton O'Farrell: And then- yeah, 'cause she wants them to do ACH. Right. So just trying to incentivize them for that. But if they were to still pay via credit card for- maybe they want the credit card points. They want a 45 day float. Do you know how the PCI compliance is handled on those then?
Deshyra Hubbard: You're saying if the customer wanted to pay with a credit card?
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, so obviously you just want to get the net amount. You have to obviously pay the credit card fee or the 3.5%. Just with how she was processing that before.
Deshyra Hubbard: The only thing I know of her processing it is just doing it in QuickBooks and literally just charging them an extra 3.5%.
Colton O'Farrell: Got it.
Deshyra Hubbard: And that's what I did this week with two credit cards is added the 3.5% as a surcharge on top of the interest.
Colton O'Farrell: Nice. Well, we have a much more streamlined solution for you and to easily deal with that. And we'll handle all the PCI compliance. Our card rate is also cheaper than what you're currently adding to the invoices. So for accounts receivable, if your customers want to pay via a credit card, there's a 2.99% fee there. But they also have the option to pay via their bank and via ACH completely for free. I'm happy to walk you through that. But before we do that, just curious, what kind of questions do you have for me? Have you created your account and kind of poked around in the platform yet? Just curious with kind of where you're at.
Deshyra Hubbard: Honestly, I'm just trying to evaluate what might be my better option. I do have to do this invoicing again on Monday, and I don't know what your process looks like, you know what I mean? I would like to not have to do QuickBooks because the problem is that I said I set up the payment merchandising part of it, right, last week, and I did my invoicing this Monday. And they just sent me a message today saying that my account is not verified and that they need to verify my account to even drop any deposits to me. So like I was expecting to get these deposits on Wednesday. this past day. And so I wasn't able to pay payroll this time. And so I had to go to the seller and have her cover it for me and me pay her back when these deposits. And it's like a real letdown. And it's like, I understand.
Colton O'Farrell: Challenges. Yeah. Especially hard.
Deshyra Hubbard: Yeah. So it's just, it's not ideal. And I kind of just don't trust them. Their support online sucks. And I, I, they asked for now all my verification information. It's like, why didn't you do that? when I opened this a week ago or more, two weeks ago. So yeah, so I'm just looking for what the best option might be for ACH because I would like to take people off credit cards and just do complete ACH. Like she doesn't send any kind of invoices for them to look at it and pay, most of them are elderly. So I literally am just collecting the payment every week. And so I just want to, whatever.
Colton O'Farrell: Is easiest, But we have a couple different options for you. So I'm happy to walk you through that and stop me if you have any questions, but we'll kind of talk through some of the workflows. So I'm gonna go ahead and share my screen. I'm just logged into my Nickel demo account here. So one nice thing about, I know you're not loving kind of being on QuickBooks or having to use them or the support, but it is beneficial in your case for at least working with Nickel, because if you come right over to the account settings here, we can go ahead and click this integrations button. You just click the green link QuickBooks account. You'd sign into your QuickBooks account. select your company chart of accounts, everything then would flow into Nickel from an accounts payable perspective here, an accounts receivable perspective here. So all of your invoices, all your customers, all your vendors, everything will be right in here. We have a native integration. So anything that is done in QuickBooks will be reflected in Nickel and anything done in Nickel will be reflected in QuickBooks. We also have this, I know you're not really loving working with QuickBooks, but And my demo account isn't actually connected to it. So I would still have to connect it. But if you were, this is what it would look like. So it lists your company. So Hubbard North America Incorporated, it lists your QuickBooks number.
Deshyra Hubbard: I want to make it clear that I can't change QuickBooks.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, no, you wouldn't be changing QuickBooks. So we, yeah, 98% of our customers use QuickBooks. So we're not trying to get you off from that. Just giving you some workarounds, because we have a number of different ways that you could work with Nickel. and also work with QuickBooks as well. So with this integration here, so like I said, mine is not actually integrated, but if you were, it was a Hubbard North America Incorporated, you'd have your QuickBooks number here. And then there's this little field, the reason I'm showing you this screenshot is because of this field here. So if you are creating an invoice from QuickBooks and you don't have to touch it again to edit it or review it, you can toggle this automation on. So it just automatically is sent via Nickel to your customer. And when we do that, you're not going to have to pay the 1% or 2% ACH charge that QuickBooks would charge you if you were to send it via them. So with that, we're just automatically sending it to your customer.
Deshyra Hubbard: It's not-- what do you mean sending it where they still have to click it and pay themselves?
Colton O'Farrell: So I'll show you what it looks like on their end. So they will receive an email or a text message. So we can either send the invoice via SMS or via email. Here's just an example. So these would be all the invoices brought in from QuickBooks to fire these off to your customer if you did not have that automation toggled on. So what I was saying before is if you're creating an invoice, you don't have to touch it much after that, you're just ready to send it to the customer. You could turn that on so they would automatically send so that your customer could either pay via ACH or via credit card. They would get a secured payment link via email or via text that they would just click to make that payment. I was just saying that it's not good to have that automation toggled on if you're generating an invoice and after you generate it, you got to review it, edit it, make adjustments. Because when that automation set up, anytime you make those revisions, your customer would get an email. So that's just kind of the one caveat where it's not good to have turned on. And in the event it was not toggled on, how you would send those off is you just come to payment request here. Here's all your invoices. You just click request payment. either send it via email or SMS. We would send this secured payment link to your customer. You just have to hit send and it would be sent to email or SMS. If you're curious what it looked like before sending it, it could open up in just new tab here. So that's just paying, copying and pasting that link in a new browser. So it'll see your name, your email, your logo, invoice name or number, amount, invoice attached, and then there's the two options to pay.
Deshyra Hubbard: So if they want to pay via Can you like customize this conversation to what I'm saying though? Because I would never send one of these, right? I'm literally taking them. I have all their ACHs. I'm taking their money. The invoice I'm sending them is like, Hey, your ACH was processed. This is what you were charged. This is what I took out of your account.
Colton O'Farrell: So we do have a payment authorization request that we can set up for your customers. So if they agree to this, you would just be able to automatically pull from their account and they would just get a receipt. for that payment that's made. You had mentioned though that with your ACH, like sending that via QuickBooks, you're paying the one to two percent ACH fee and you don't want to be doing that anymore. Is that I'm understanding that correctly?
Deshyra Hubbard: I mean, I'd like to pay lower fees. Yes.
Colton O'Farrell: We have no fees with ACH and.
Deshyra Hubbard: We are- But you're saying, are you saying that they have to give consent though? Is that what you're saying?
Colton O'Farrell: What I was saying with, so we have this feature called payment authorization, like Where you would send like a payment term. So it would have a limit of what you could pull from their account or no limit. It'd have an expiration date or no expiration date. They would simply just click and agree to those. So that's like more, that would be more on like the, so setting up a customer here, I can show you what it kind of looks like right here. So we'll just set you up as a pretend customer here, just so you could see exactly what that email would look like. So all right, I'm just gonna grab this quick. We're gonna go ahead and set you up as a pretend customer here. And I'm also gonna set click this payment authorization form. Is the, okay, I'm gonna do this email. So we're gonna go ahead, you should be getting an email in just a moment. Oh, and this is where we would toggle on the permission. So if we wanted full permission, This would be like no limit, no expiration date. Your customer would just agree to the terms and you'd be able to auto pull from their account. Otherwise, you could do limited permissions here where you could set like a max transaction limit when this expires and you could just put a quick note in here. Let's see. Awesome. So I would just hit send this, you're going to get an email in just a moment. And this is, so I'll stop sharing here for a moment. When you get that email, if you want to share your screen, I'm happy to talk through and walk through kind of the email that you received.
Deshyra Hubbard: Are you saying that this form is a one-time thing?
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, this is, well, it would be dependent on if your customer, like the dates. So if it, obviously it's only good for the expiration date. your customer can also revoke that authorization at any point. And we explain that to them when they're filling it out. But this may be something that is beneficial for you. Otherwise, I'm happy to walk through just the general workflow of sending that invoice to your customer via email. I can send it to you if you want to see what it looks like, but very easy process there too. So just trying to give you some examples that work with kind of your use cases.
Deshyra Hubbard: But is this form the only way to pull ACH from them or are you saying there's other options besides this form?
Colton O'Farrell: This would automatically pull from them so they wouldn't even have to confirm anything because they've already given permission. This is the only way that you'd be able to auto pull from them, but we can still send them like a payment link. They can still click it, make the payment. But I know you have a lot of elderly customers and that's probably not their ideal I was just curious how they were paying, but oh, and another potential solution. So what do you think about this? We also have a payment portal too that every customer gets set up with automatically. So that's just right here with the get paid tab. So you just go to payments portal here. This is set up for all of our customers automatically. It's included for free. You can customize this to be Hubbard North America Incorporated. Could have your whatever kind of banner you'd like in the background. On the free plan, we can't customize the domain or URL, but on our like Nickel Plus plan, the paid subscription, we can do that if it was important to you. But what this could be is a one stop shop for a customer or for you to enter your customer's details in. So I'll show you just like with a quick little test here. So they would just enter whatever invoice amount or you would do this on their behalf. They would click make a payment. They're going to be prompted to this screen right here. where it's either pay by card with a 2.99% fee, or they could pay via their bank with ACH. If you have this information, you could enter it and you could complete the payment for them. This could be embedded in your website, but this is also a potential solution.
Deshyra Hubbard: Is this, but can this be, like will it save this information or is this every single invoice?
Colton O'Farrell: So this is just like a one-stop shop for you or a customer to come in, enter a payment, list the reason or invoice amount, and just make the payment. This was initially something that we set up for an individual customer, and then we realized that there was a lot of value for it. Unfortunately, with where it's at right now, in about a month, customers will be able to see all their previous transaction history within this portal. They can, when we're sending actual invoices to them via email or via text, but in the portal, we don't have the history for that. But this would serve, if you have their ACH information and just need to enter it in there, that could potentially be a solution for you as well.
Deshyra Hubbard: But you're saying, are you saying that I would have to do that for every single, like every single amount for every single client?
Colton O'Farrell: We can, we just don't have a way for, unless you have an auto authorized, like a payment authorization form from them, we don't have a way just to pull those automatically. If you edit for all of your customers, we absolutely could do that, but we that's the only way that we can just like auto pull from a customer. Otherwise, what it would look like via email is we would send an email that looks like this to your customer. So they would get an email that would say your company, your logo, it would have the invoice amount there. You could put a note there, invoice would be attached. If they reply to the email, you'll be CC'd on communication. And when they hit pay now, it's just gonna be prompted to this screen. but they could pay by card, they could pay by bank. But we either have this option, we have the payment authorization where you can auto pull from their accounts, or we have the payment portal are kind of some of the suggestions for you. And the benefits of Nickel again, ACH is always 100% free. We're gonna have some of the lowest credit card rates. Your customers don't have to sign up and use Nickel. We have a completely free plan. So I don't know if you had many questions about the pricing. But I'll just pull that up for you just to answer any questions if you do. But the main kind of takeaway from this screen is we have our nickel core plan 100% free plan with us. There are some limitations on there. So you can only have three active users. You can only do $25,000 per ACH transaction, not cumulative. So you can do 100 of those. You just cannot do one at $26,000. You also get access to the payment portal. ACH processing is generally 2 to 3 business days. We are still required to get that into our sponsor bank before 4:00 PM Eastern Standard Time. But as long as you get in by that day on the free plan, you'd be seeing about a two to three day turnaround time. We also have the Nickel Plus subscription. So it's either $45 monthly or it's $35 a month with an annual subscription. What we do here is we give you unlimited users. We bump up the transaction limit to $1,000,000 per ACH. You can schedule payments in advance. can do recurring payments. And then also the ACH processing time is sped up to either same day to two day turnaround times, dependent on when you get it in to Nickel. But there's no hidden fees, no transaction charges, nothing like that with us.
Deshyra Hubbard: So how do you guys make money?
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, great question. I mean, we make money from our subscription, like the Nickel Plus subscription, credit card fees, So by default on the accounts receivable side, if your customer wants to pay via credit card, so we're making that 2.99%, we're also giving you complete control on how much of that is paid for by your customer. So by default, 100% of that cost is going to be covered by your customer. Let's say though you have agreements that you want to split this 50/50, you could set it up like that. If you wanted to fully eat the cost, you could do that. We could also go over on an invoice level. So that's a global rule there. Like I said, by default, 100% of that cost is sent to your customer to pay. But if you wanted to override the global rule just for one invoice, you could do that just right here. So we could go, you would just toggle this bottom field on here. So say, for example, we wanted to split that 50/50 with the customer just for this invoice, but everybody else we want to pay the full rate. We would set that up here, but we're a cash positive business. We have over 10,000 customers who use us for accounts payable, accounts receivable, or both. We've found that when you provide a free solution like we have done, and especially free ACH, you will create raving customers. You'll get a ton of really positive customer reviews, referrals. And yeah, I mean, you bring in the big players when you have your name recognition out there. And yeah, we're doing really well. So that's how we're making money. But if there's plenty of customers we make nothing from, to be honest, unless their customers are paying via credit card. But again, we're still a cash positive business. So.
Deshyra Hubbard: So if I, if I were to do the ACH form authorization, right, for them to sign that one time, What's the cap of transaction limit? Because you said there's an expiration. So what's the highest amount you can put there?
Colton O'Farrell: So you can put no limit. So when I sent it to you, I think we put a limit for like 25 grand for like a year or something in that email you got, right? Let me just open up here. I'm going to open up another email that I got from that will list a sample of this. All right. So let's see right here, this one. So this is like the similar to the form that you received here. So if you were to go to complete the authorization form, when you click this here, we do have like frequently asked questions and answers, kind of what I was explaining to you before, what this authorization is for. you know, who is Nickel or SOC 2 compliant, everything's protected, bank level security, all that. They can revoke this authorization at any point, and then we accept ACH or credit card, but they just go to get started. This would be like the extent. So there'd be no limit, no expiration date. I've read and agreed to the terms, and then they simply would say how they're going to pay that via card or via ACH with their bank. So that is the payment authorization request form. But once that's done, you would just automatically be able to pull from their account and you can see that here. So with.
Deshyra Hubbard: On the form, they have to connect their bank.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, on the form, they would have to connect their bank either route, that's why, oh, that's plaid there. This is a demo account. That's why it's showing up. They would just have to enter their routing and account number. Full name, email, or address, that kind of information there. But once they confirm and authorize, that's how you'd be pulling from their account. Okay. What other questions do we have? Probably got your mind trying to think about the best solution for you or kind of workflows, but just kind of curious what your overall thoughts are so far. this seeming kind of what you're looking for?
Deshyra Hubbard: Yeah, no, I like the platform. It's just I really don't know because these ACHs were already a struggle and I manually put them in two QuickBooks because I'd be going to 70 different houses with old people trying to haggle and like, I'm a new owner. They don't even know me. You know what I'm saying?
Colton O'Farrell: Yep.
Deshyra Hubbard: So I'm I'm still working with the original seller. I'd have to talk to her about what she thinks would be the best solution to this, because obviously I don't like the fees of QuickBooks.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep.
Deshyra Hubbard: And like this is a better long-term solution. I just, I'd have to figure out what's like the best way to do that because yeah, elderly people are not going to fill out that form, especially when some of them have like, you know, sons or daughters that are in charge. of their accounts.
Colton O'Farrell: Right.
Deshyra Hubbard: But yeah, and a lot of them like things by mail. So yeah, so I like the product. I just, I'm going to have to like figure out that's for sure.
Colton O'Farrell: And I think talking with the seller is a great idea if you wanted to as well, like on the free account, if you wanted to kind of try test trialing with some of the, I mean, I know it's a new business, you probably don't know who the easiest kind of customers are to deal with. But a lot of our customers will do kind of a soft rollout where they'll test it out with a few, see what they think. Other people want to just add all their QuickBooks in there and just go ahead and get started. My role is to really answer your questions, equip you with everything you need to use Nickel to your use cases and to support your business. What I'll do, and this might be helpful when you're talking with the seller, is I have like a prerecorded five-ish minute video of walking through the Nickel platform, covering all the workflows we covered. that way she'd be able to see kind of what we're talking about, be able to advise a little bit on some of those potential solutions. I'll send that additional resources. So like our pricing page, security stuff. So just one other thing to note is we are just the payment processor. There's no money ever living in Nickel. All of your money is always yours. It's always moved in FDIC insured accounts. We're SOC 2 compliant. All of your customers information is also protected via encryption, tokenization. all of that as well. So happy to share those resources for you. But I'll keep an eye out to just see if your account is activated. All you need to do on your end to like set up with Nickel is you have to create an account and link a payment method. Once that's done, you're able to send or receive payments via Nickel.
Deshyra Hubbard: So do you like check the payment method though? Is there like a verification of the.
Colton O'Farrell: Bank or so we use Plaid for all of our customers, like all of our actual customer accounts. So when you're signing up to the account, we do have a Plaid verification, but it's very simple. You send a code to your phone sort of thing, enter it just to make sure it's you and it's not fraudulent.
Deshyra Hubbard: Okay. And if I say I did a payment on Monday at 3 Eastern, is the turnaround time truly like a Wednesday? I could expect that or what's the delay factor?
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah. So it is. So if you got it in before that 4 pm cutoff time on the free plan, it is, you'd most likely get it in two days, three days at the very latest. That's the free plan. On the plus plan, like the paid for subscription, it would be same day and at the very latest, like that following day. We're definitely a lot faster than pretty much anybody else and especially, like, mail checks, so, yeah.
Deshyra Hubbard: And then, so would I be more of like a custom deal on your three layout or the middle in terms of your pricing?
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah. So the, so the, for the pricing, it's really only the, the two. Let me just pull this up again. So the, the third pricing, I kind of get annoyed that they have it on this page because a lot of people ask about it. This is for like Fortune 500 companies who are doing 50 million dollars in credit card transactions and they want their own, like white glove service, custom rates, things like that. Most of our customers are on the Nickel Plus. And then for small businesses who they're fine with like the 25,000 limit per transaction, they don't need to do recurring or scheduling payments in advance. They'll be on this plan. But we'd give every customer a 14-day free trial of Nickel Plus. If you decide that that's not really what you need, you can always revert back to the free plan. You can also self-serve at any point like yourself for the Nickel subscription. Just come into account settings, plans, and you can just upgrade like so. Again, there's no hidden fees with Nickel. If you were to do the Nickel Plus annual subscription, it'll just be billed at $420 annually. And yeah, the turnaround times, though, are as they say there, like the three day and the two day here, that's like the extent of it. They just don't want to, they said like, you know, same day for this. for everyone. If they get it in after 4 pm, they don't want people to be upset by that because they clearly missed the cutoff time. So that's why we have it in there. But generally it's same day to two day turnaround time.
Deshyra Hubbard: So if they fill out the authorization form, like, does that just say that for them in there? Like, if I bring the invoice in, can you, like, show me how, like, I could pull the money and then, like, the invoice show? zero on it. Because the thing is the invoice still needs to show what exactly was billed, not just a receipt that says, Hey, this is the amount that was charged to your account. It needs to have the breakdown of it.
Colton O'Farrell: So I'm just wondering where the best place would be to show that. So we could do find a customer. I don't have a payment method on my demo account here. I believe I can show this. I just have to remember what would be because all of these are obviously mock data in here. But there is like a lightning bolt. That's the indication that you're on a plus subscription plan that you could just charge payment method on file. So it would pull in the invoice and instead of sending it to the customer, because you have the payment authorization form, We could just pull from that automatically. We also, I wanted to mention this, maybe, do you know, did the seller have anything like that before, like paper-based paper authorization forms or anything like that? They did?
Deshyra Hubbard: Yeah, well, yeah, like they have a contract with her that has their information on file, right? But like, I'm gonna have to get new contracts with them. And I don't, I mean, yeah, so I'm going to have to eventually do that. I just don't know when.
Colton O'Farrell: Well, I was going to say we can honor previous payment authorization forms. The only thing is because of, like, it's not Nickel based, it generally would mean a little bit slower in payments. But we do honor authorization forms from other customers. It just can impact the speed of payment sometimes. So that's why we recommend generally to go through Nickel. But if it's really challenging to do that and you already have those, I mean, those are things that we can work with.
Deshyra Hubbard: But it wouldn't say my company name on it.
Colton O'Farrell: So the name changed as well. Obviously, you change it to your last name, right? Okay. Yeah. I would maybe discuss that with the seller, see what kind of her thoughts are with that. sure when it comes to like the new acquisition and how that, because I, you know, generally that stuff would roll over, but because you changed the name, I don't, yeah, I think there would be a, well, it's not that the.
Deshyra Hubbard: Name, like I, the, the DBA was transferred, but like she's her own entity and I'm my own entity. So it's like, it's, it's technically, it's not like, it's not a stock purchase, it's an asset purchase. So, right. Not the whole thing.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, I don't have a great answer for that one, unfortunately. I would discuss with the seller, if you hear back from her and kind of recommendations there, I'd be happy to let you know kind of what our side thinks about that, but it's definitely something that we can work with. So if they exist, it might be something worth looking into. Otherwise, we do have some of those other options, like the payment portal can just go through a basic workflow of instead of maybe sending it to like the elderly person, if there is like a younger son or daughter involved that's more tech savvy, They might be good to work with too. So just recommendation. But I'll send you resources. Unfortunately, the Zoom call is about to boot me here. So I'm not hanging up on you. Just want to make sure I don't leave you on a note like this. But what I'll do is I'll send a follow-up email with those resources I mentioned. They'll have everything you need to set up the account, use it as you need. If you have any questions or get indication from the seller or just after thinking about this, what the ideal workflow and kind of payment authorization flow is for you. Happy to workshop it with you and we can come up with a solution. But how does that sound? It sounds good.
Deshyra Hubbard: I appreciate it. Yeah, please sound.
Colton O'Farrell: Awesome. Cool. Well, it was a pleasure speaking with you. If you have any questions in the meantime, feel free to reach out.
Deshyra Hubbard: Otherwise, we'll be speaking with you soon.
Colton O'Farrell: All right.
Deshyra Hubbard: Thank you. Appreciate it. Of course. Pleasure. Have a good one. You too.
