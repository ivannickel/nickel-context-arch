Hala: Can I help you?
Colton O'Farrell: Hi, good morning. Is this Holla?
Hala: Yes.
Colton O'Farrell: Hi. Holla. This is Colton from Nickel. How is it going?
Hala: Oh, God, we have an appointment. I am so sorry.
Colton O'Farrell: You're totally good. I just wanted to double check and make sure that this time still worked for you.
Hala: Yeah, I just lost track of time. I'm so sorry.
Colton O'Farrell: You. No need to apologize. Glad I could get in touch with you. Yeah. Whenever you have a sec. If you could pop into the Zoom meeting and happy to review the transactions that you've done. So I'll just wait for you on this Zoom meeting. Let me know if you have any issues logging into it, by the way.
Hala: Okay. I'm getting on right now.
Colton O'Farrell: Perfect.
Hala: All right. Thank you, sir.
Colton O'Farrell: My pleasure. Yeah, talk to you soon.
Hala: All right, bye. Okay, bye.
Colton O'Farrell: Hey. Hello.
Hala: Hey. Sorry about that.
Colton O'Farrell: Not a problem. How was your Thursday starting?
Hala: Good.
Colton O'Farrell: Good. Awesome. Yeah, same here. One more day tell. Or it's Friday, Junior, right now. So you got one more day, and then the weekend's here. So. Excited for that. Have any exciting plans or anything? No, no, just a little relaxation.
Hala: Yeah.
Colton O'Farrell: Very cool. I'm planning to do the same, so I don't blame you whatsoever. Awesome. Well, holla. 1. I wanted to just pick your brain a little bit, understand since, you know, the last meeting we. September 18th was curious how using nickel has been going. I've been seeing some transactions going through, have done some deep dives into those. Looks like everything is working as it should be, but just wanted to kind of hear it from yourself, like, what's your experience? Been.
Hala: Super smooth. No. No issues.
Colton O'Farrell: Love to hear that. Hola. Would you mind sharing your logging into the nickel platform and sharing your screen with me?
Hala: Yeah.
Colton O'Farrell: Awesome. I did it. There was one payment I had a question about, and I was wondering if you had more insight into it. I just want to make sure this was not on our end.
Hala: The canceled one?
Colton O'Farrell: Yep. With.
Hala: No, no, it was me.
Colton O'Farrell: Oh, it was okay.
Hala: I accidentally set it up for the same day, so when I realized it, it was right after I set it up, I was like, crap. And I went in and canceled it immediately.
Colton O'Farrell: Okay, perfect. That's completely fine. We didn't run into anything. I just wanted to make sure that was one that was supposed to be canceled and wasn't, like, a rejected error for some reason.
Hala: No, no. I. I set up. So I. I set up the days. Like I'm. I'm putting the day that I. That. And then I'm. I'm. It's. It's my. It's my Own fault. I'm not double checking when it's actually going out, when I'm going to actually process the payment. And so I'm not like I'm double checking it beforehand and it's. It's my own fault. So that's, that's why that. That is happening.
Colton O'Farrell: I gotcha. That's super helpful. Thanks for explaining that. Cool. You're just taking a look in here. Yeah. As you were going through this, you know, I've seen we've. Let's see, total payments kind of ran through here. Looks like we've done 22 transactions since the last time we spoke, which is awesome. You guys have been doing a great job with the onboarding. Everything looks good, at least from what I can see. I more so wanted to pick your brain a little bit of, you know, hey, what do you love about nickel? What. What seems to just kind of flow and make sense here with what you're. When. When you're kind of going through your workflow and if there's something that is requiring you like extra work or you just wish like a certain area was over here or just reset up to be kind of optimal workflow for you. Really just interested in hearing kind of that overall feedback. If there's anything you're like, I'm not sure why this aspect is here. I feel like it makes more sense on this side. Anything like that. Holla. That's kind of standing out for you in the platform.
Hala: So the only thing that I'm seeing is actually more on. On the back end. So if I'm setting up multiple payments to the same vendor, I wish that when it was withdrawn that it would be one transaction withdrawn from my account.
Colton O'Farrell: So this is for. On the accounts payable side.
Hala: Yes.
Colton O'Farrell: So you're paying this. Keo Construction Incorporated looks like multiple payments here and you were wishing that it would be just. Instead of individual polls, you would want it just combined into one.
Hala: Yeah.
Colton O'Farrell: And can I ask a little bit more for. For that. Because one reason why we have it separated so that if there's multiple payments with one customer, we still treat them as their own kind of atomic unit. So we're not waiting to do like batch processing that for like the idea at least that we have with that is that it makes it really easy for the one to one reconciliation because you can just find the individual payment with Keogh Construction Incorporated, cross reference it with whatever's in your system and just have that matching. But you, you would like it all so that it's just if there's one vendor, you've done a bunch of payments with them. For you, it would be fine just to have that overall cumulative amount.
Hala: I mean, I guess in my. On my end, it doesn't make a difference because I know that there's. I know that they're for separate transactions, but, like, Daniel was looking at. Daniel's my boss. When he was looking at it, he's like, are these transaction fees? And I'm like, are you retarded? They literally say, ach. Like, no.
Colton O'Farrell: Right?
Hala: I was like, no, they're payments for bills. And he goes, oh, so they're all separate. Yeah. They literally say the same thing.
Colton O'Farrell: He initially thought, though, that it was fees on the transactions.
Hala: Yeah. And I was like, oh, they're not. They're not fees. But my thinking was if they were all grouped together, then I would know that I paid Keo that week X amount of dollars instead of having to add them up. You know what I'm saying?
Colton O'Farrell: Yep, definitely.
Hala: But I don't think it really makes much of a difference. That's the only thing I could. That's the only thing I thought of. But, you know, I don't think it really makes much of a difference for me other than that. I don't really see. I don't really see anything that has. That I have, like, any issues with on here. You know, on bill.com. i, I, I. And I'm comparing the two because that's the only other one that I've used. You know, on build.build.com, it's like you kind of build an invoice to send customers and could be good and bad. I like the idea that I can kind of. Because we use Roofer for our proposals with customers. I like the idea that I can make an invoice in Roofer and then just download it and then upload it into here when I'm billing the customer. And then when it's paid through here, I can upload the receipt back into Roofer and then close out that invoice. So I kind of like that an invoice is made in Roofer and closed out in Roofer. You know what I'm saying?
Colton O'Farrell: Yep.
Hala: Whereas if your bill.com it was kind of like I was billing through one place and then signed contracts were somewhere else, and it was. I don't know, it seemed kind of messy to me.
Colton O'Farrell: That sounds that, that sounds like a fair call out.
Hala: So this kind of helps me streamline it a little bit more, because otherwise I was making two invoices for no reason.
Colton O'Farrell: Right. So you're grabbing the. The proposals from Roofer and then you're just attaching those here when you send out the invoices. Am I understanding that right?
Hala: Well, I'm actually making. Like Roofer has an option to make an invoice.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep.
Hala: And so what I'm doing is making an invoice off of the proposal in Roofer and then downloading it and uploading it here to. To the. The link and then sending an invoice that way.
Colton O'Farrell: That's perfect.
Hala: So a customer actually has a copy of it and they know what they're paying.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah. Do you want to open up one of these? And I just. I would love to see that. That invoice. So if you click on the one like the proposal and invoice that you're generating in Roofer that you're attaching, if you just click any of the invoices, we should be able to just. And if I take this one. Perfect. Yep. So if you scroll down just a little bit and then hit this I. The eyeball icon. Hold on here. I can annotate where. Right. Oh, if you go back down. Right.
Hala: Okay, I see it.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep. So that is how you would look at the actual attachments that you've included. So this is what I'm seeing right here is what you're generating in Roofer. This is the actual invoice here.
Hala: And so I'm able to tell them this is, you know, the deductible and the first check from insurance. So they know that this is what they're paying and it's, you know, it comes from Roofer. So then I can take, you know, it has their information on it. And then once they pay, I can actually download the receipt from.
Colton O'Farrell: From Nickel.
Hala: From Nickel, and then upload it to Roofer under payments. And all my paperwork is now under Roofer. So I can show payment. I can show everything all together.
Colton O'Farrell: Awesome. So just to re. Re state what you. What you shared with me, so you're generating the proposal and the invoices directly in Roofer. You're downloading that invoice. Once it's ready, you're uploading it into Nickel. When you're generating the invoice, sending that off to the customer, they're paying it. They have a copy of the PDF invoice from Roofer. Once they pay that, you have the receipt downloaded that nickel gives you. So you download that receipt from Nickel and then you upload it into Roofer, and that's how you're keeping your books balanced, basically.
Hala: Yeah. Because the insurance companies will want us to show that the deductible was paid and they want to show that, you know, the checks were paid to us in order for them to release, you know, their depreciation and things like that and to release supplements.
Colton O'Farrell: I gotcha.
Hala: So I have to be able to show that these things were paid. So before what I was having to do was download it from Bill and then like I was having to upload it to Roofer, but then I was having to attach it to Roofer, make an invoice in Roofer and it. And pretty much like fake a payment in Roofer to make. It was just so like sounds a.
Colton O'Farrell: Little, a little more convoluted than it needs to be.
Hala: Right, right, right. It was just really convoluted and I was like, what are we doing? So it's, it's really nice to be able to like take like an invoice number and attach an invoice number to a payment number in nickel and have them match.
Colton O'Farrell: Absolutely. That's. No, that's a really helpful explanation of kind of what your current state was. And like I can already see like the impact just with how much more streamlined the process is with, with removing the, you know, bill.com generation of an invoice. Because yeah, sounds really ridiculous having to create two of those and then fake mark one is paid just to like have that balanced out. Yeah, definitely see how this streamlines your process.
Hala: And like Roofer, you can, you can set up payments through Roofer, but their fees are like ridiculous.
Colton O'Farrell: What, what are the keys if you don't mind sharing?
Hala: I'm just, I want to, I want to say their credit card fees are. I want to say they're like three point something percent and I know that there's a charge for ACH fees. I don't remember what it is. All I remember is when I had looked into it initially I was like, nope, we're not doing that.
Colton O'Farrell: So you were. So you. How long have you been with Roofer for?
Hala: We had been with them for oh like four or five months.
Colton O'Farrell: And overall, overall you're, it's been like a helpful solution for you guys. The only thing you dislike really is the, the fees that they associate. If you are trying to use them as that kind of order to cash completion service.
Hala: Yeah, and that's, and that's honestly it's, it's all CRM programming and it's across the board because prior to them we were with ACCU Links and they were even more expensive when it came to the processing. And we were. We switched from Accu links. AccuLinX was charging us, like, four times the amount that Roofer was per month for the same services. Bro, what are we doing?
Colton O'Farrell: I would say the same thing. Dang.
Hala: Yeah. Yeah. And they became pretty combative when I told them we were switching.
Colton O'Farrell: In what way? I'm just. Were they trying to defend their, like, pricing actions or what?
Hala: Was essentially. And they were very upset that we were switching to Roofer in particular. They were literally like, you know, we. We don't like people leaving, and we certainly don't like them leaving for that company.
Colton O'Farrell: I bet Roofer's probably taking a big chunk of their customer base.
Hala: Yeah. I was like, bro, calm down, okay?
Colton O'Farrell: Like, maybe you have a better. Have a better product that you're not trying to price gouge us with, and we're not.
Hala: I mean. I mean, I'll put it to you this way. We're paying $169 a month for roofer. We were paying $800 a month plus.
Colton O'Farrell: With, like, pretty easy math to me. You don't have to have a PhD in mathematics to realize this is.
Hala: Yeah, this is not hard. And then as soon as we left, they. They. Well, they told us, okay, well, we need 24 hours to turn to. To cut you guys off. So we said, okay, fine. They turned around and cut me off immediately. And I was still re. Downloading all the stuff that I had put in there.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah.
Hala: And so I reached out to the guy and I was like, what happened to the 24 hours? I'm still trying to get our customers out of this system. So he was like, oh, well, okay, well, you could put your credit card information back in. It'll reactivate it. I said, okay, fine. And then he said, and then when you're done, just email me and I'll turn it back off. So I said, okay. So I did, and I emailed him, and no response. I emailed him again, and no response.
Colton O'Farrell: Good lord.
Hala: And then 30 days later, they charged us. And I reached out to them and they were like, oh, well, it looks like you put your credit card information back in, so we're not going to refund you. And I responded to them and I said, yeah, well, here's an email from your douchebag retention team.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah.
Hala: Telling me put my credit card information in.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep.
Hala: She reached out to him, and then they decided, okay, well, they're going to refund us. And ever since, I've been getting phone calls from their quote unquote retention team trying to get us to come back and telling me they'll cut us a deal and charge us 200amonth for the same setup we already had. And I was like, doesn't that mean you've been overcharging me by $600 a month for a year?
Colton O'Farrell: Right.
Hala: Why would I go back?
Colton O'Farrell: They just seem like they're, they're digging a bigger hole every, every time. Wow. What a.
Hala: And considering the way you over. You charged me again when we cancelled and the way you acted to. Towards us when we cancelled. No, I wouldn't go back to you. If my head was on fire, I wouldn't go back to you.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, that sounds like a. Just absolutely one of the worst customer experiences I've ever heard of. So you had to go through that. That's really, really frustrating. But it sounds like Roofer is working great for you. And when you're comparing them to the status quo of what you had before, I bet it's like a breath of fresh air being with them. So.
Hala: There is, there's a, a step up in Roofer that does give you like more features, but honestly it's not, it's. I don't think they're features that we would particularly use. We don't use the program the way most companies would. Really. I'm the only one that uses Roofer and I just kind of dictate to the rest of the team what I need them to do. So there's really no point in us going to the one step up. But yeah, it's, it has made it a lot easier for proposals and, and you know, keeping customers information there and all of that. Like I said, the only downside is the processing part.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep. But hey, that's where Nickel steps in and.
Hala: Exactly.
Colton O'Farrell: Seems like it plays really well with the, with the current setup we have.
Hala: Yeah.
Colton O'Farrell: This is all awesome. Yeah. Thank you so much for sharing all this. This is super helpful information for me and for team here at Nickel. Just. Yeah, I feel like I have a pretty good understanding of kind of your business objectives. Sounds like Nickel is meeting those. I'm happy to share as well that we are only going to be releasing more features and more advancements within the product this year. We have a ton on our product roadmap with new updates that'll be coming out regularly. So it's only going to get like the availability. With Nickel, you're, you've got in where you know it's still meeting your needs, but the sky's the limit and we're only building upwards for that so.
Hala: That'S great. That's great. I'm. I'm looking forward to continue using it and seeing where you guys can grow and. Yeah, I. And. And then that's the thing. It's. I feel the same way about kind of like, again, coming back to Roofer. I feel the same way with Damage. They're. They're. They're smaller company and they're improving every day, so new releases come out, and I can see it changing. And I feel the same way kind of with Nickel that I can see eventually things starting to change and, you know, adding features and stuff like that. So, yeah, I'm all about, you know, smaller companies and new technology, so I definitely look forward to seeing where you guys can go from here.
Colton O'Farrell: Well, Hollow, I know, you know, it's been pretty early on that you've been working with us, but something just for you to keep in the back of your head is I would love to, as we go on kind of in the next few months here, just, yeah. Keeping kind of a track of your experience with Nickel, kind of what you were dealing with before, you know, and the switch to Roofer, and how Nickel has been kind of that nice medium since, you know, after Bill.com was kind of duplicating some of the work. But would love to just in the future if you'd be open to it, like a case study just kind of on your experience with Nick Nickel. We obviously have a lot of roofers that work with us, and I. I'm sure there's many that have been dealing with similar situations as yourself. So in the coming months, as we're going, just kind of keeping a track of your experience with Nickel, we'd love to potentially, like, feature your company and you in a story just of Nickel working with Roofers, essentially. So just wanted to throw that out there if that'd be something you'd be interested in in the future.
Hala: Yeah, absolutely.
Colton O'Farrell: Awesome. Well, it's really great to hear. So. Perfect. I know we're running up here on time.
Hala: Holla.
Colton O'Farrell: Anything else that you have for me on my end? Basically, what we do on this standpoint, so, you know, we. We did the onboarding training. You've done great with it. You have everything you need. Looks like it's working exactly as it should be. What we typically do is we throw on another meeting for a few months in the future just to kind of recap, make sure everything's still going good. We can introduce you to new product features. We can go through some of your usage metrics, but then Also, we could have that conversation later about kind of that case study essentially. So is it cool if we throw something on your calendar for maybe four months or so in the future and we can adjust as.
Hala: Yeah.
Colton O'Farrell: Cool. Maybe. Actually we'll. We'll throw something on. Do you have any vacation in December besides like Christmas time holidays? I was thinking the week of December 8th to the 12th, maybe it might be just a good placeholder and we can always bump it out if we need to from there.
Hala: Anytime.
Colton O'Farrell: Cool. Well, I'm gonna just go ahead and throw a meeting on for Thursday, December 11th. We'll just schedule it at this time. It's obvious very much in the future, so if anything changes, we can bump that out as needed. But again, this will just be reviewing some of your usage metrics, introducing you to new product features. I think December would be a great time to meet because that's when a lot of them are slated to go through. But I will send that invite once we get off the call here if you just want to accept that. But if anything comes up in the meantime, always feel free to reach out to me. Otherwise you have the help center as well that you can message the team. But really excited to be supporting your business and can't wait to continue working with you.
Hala: All right, thank you so much for all your help. I appreciate it.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, it's been my pleasure, Hala. Well, you have a wonderful rest of your day and we'll chat soon. Okay.
Hala: All right, thank you.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep. Bye. Bye.
Hala: Bye.
