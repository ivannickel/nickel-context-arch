Jason: Hey, Christian, how's it going?
Christian Sheerer: Jason, how are you?
Jason: Very good, man.
Christian Sheerer: Doing well over here. Staying busy. Better than sitting around doing nothing, so I can't complain.
Jason: That's it.
Christian Sheerer: Living the life. So I saw you sent Colton over some questions. Yeah, sorry for the double ping there.
Jason: Yeah, no worries.
Christian Sheerer: He just got notified and we like to check in with people who interact with us in the first instance. So. I think we can start and work through them before going through those specific questions. I want to understand what the business is looking like at a high level in terms of payments, where you guys are currently sitting and running those things now. Now as well as what volume looks like on a month-to-month basis, what the per transaction looks like. That's typically how we start and then weaving through the platform, we can answer all these questions one by one.
Jason: Okay, sounds like a plan. Cool.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, so you tell me, I guess where payments currently sitting right now, how are you sending them out?
Jason: Yeah, so we're a big proponent of QuickBooks Enterprise. We email our invoices out. Typically monthly, we have some quarterly and a couple of annual clients. But right now we're 100% check payment. So, paper check or ACH?
Christian Sheerer: Okay, 100% check. And, sorry, remind me on the cadence, it's quarterly or monthly?
Jason: Mostly monthly. We have a handful of quarterly and just a couple of yearly. Cool.
Christian Sheerer: Gotcha. And what is it looking like month to month in terms of volume coming in on checks? Like how many checks and what amount typically per check or if you know the total?
Jason: Well, I mean, I can tell you yearly, we're at about a million. Okay, cool. And like I said, that's mostly monthly revenue. Monthly.
Christian Sheerer: And so that average check size is.
Jason: It's all over the place. I mean, typically in the low thousands, I got one customer, 30 something thousand every month. So it's kind of a big spread.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, no, it's good to know the high and low end just because that's sort of how we tier people's usage of the platform to use NCH. It's 35 a month. And to get into the fees, it's 35 a month. There's no fees on ACH passed on credit card fees if you give people that option. And they want to pay by credit card. Sometimes people who are like primarily checked, they come to us, they're saying, Hey, we've done checks for 40 years. Nobody's ever paid us any other way. They offer it. It's pretty foolproof. People start using credit cards, but that is default passed on to the customer. And so the 37,000, you know, transaction is like, it would get you up into that nickel plus tier where where the the maximum you could do on the free plan is 25,000 per transaction. Right. So, but that's really it in terms of the fee structure. If you're making a payment to a vendor and you use credit cards, 2.9%. If a customer is paying you with a credit card, 2.99, but passed on to them unless you want to share it with them for whatever reason, ACH is completely zero fees and no sense on an ACH or what have you. I have an inkling as to why you might want to move away from checks just because we're in the 21st century, but what were you running into? You're driving checks taking a long time back and forth to the bank. Is it an approval process is just slowing you down?
Jason: What's kind of- well, actually, believe it or not, the biggest push here is, you know, kind of the request from the customer and just a better way to have a more stable payment method, right? So it takes forever sometimes for the company side or the customer side to do their approvals and generate their checks and send them out. Whereas, you know, at least from my experience with my vendors, if I just give them a credit card number and I say, okay, I'm gonna pay you whatever every month, I just know every month that charge is gonna hit the card. It's all good. So I'm hoping to move our company to that model where we're not chasing money, but it's just kind of a thing we do on a, you know, interim basis, whether it be monthly, quarterly or yearly.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, awesome. Yeah. And that's, that's, because checks both sides, right? Like that's, that's something that we hear on a lot actually is like we had a customer come into us, their name's Chicago brass. And they were only doing checks for, I don't know, they've been around for like 100 years, something like that. But they've been doing checks for pretty much the entirety lifespan of the business. And I might be exaggerating the 100 years. I'm young, so forgive me. Everything seems like 100 years ago if it was before I was born. But. And yeah, what they recognize is they saved a turnaround time of about from 10 days on an average payment to like two because now all they have to do is just wait for the ACH to clear. And what's nice and what I'll show you is like, this is I think the first thing I'll start off with is about the approval process. It's one thing they have to drive checks right to the bank and the owner has to deposit them and everything like that. So that's on the receiving end. But on the the AR side with people who are sending them stuff, they don't have to, you know, a lower level person in the organization can have access to the business account routing number information and just like approve a payment to go out to you to get received without having to go through that approval process. And, you know, you don't have to follow up so many times over email or call them and be like, Hey, you know, you guys owe us this check, can you send it? And they, they're not excuse, but their explanation is like, yeah, well, I got to get, you know, Got to send it to Iowa to get it signed and then have it bring back whatever, right?
Jason: Yep, absolutely.
Christian Sheerer: And so when you set up an invoice through us, it's one-to-one link, one invoice per secure payment link. So you don't have to collect their information. They don't have to send out an account routing number to them. The system will do that. And so if I send, I have a record number of, of Christians that I've created today. And I broke that record earlier in the morning, and I keep breaking it. I send Christian. So this is me as degraw distribution. So this is me as Jason, my business sending Christian. An invoice, can upload documents, do whatever, write a little note, you can send a recurring, set it up for every month or what have you, and I'll send it over and it'll create this link. And so I'll send over that link to Christian and then I'll open up in another tab what that looks like on their end. They see, okay, cool, we got a new payment request. I'll go in, see that it's a recurring payment, and then super simple. They can handle their own approval process, but it won't have to require too much back and forth. The only back and forth is they lose that email and you just have to send them that link again.
Jason: Now, is there any way to integrate this with our QuickBooks system?
Christian Sheerer: We do have QuickBooks desktop. Being natively built by our engineers now, like the integration. We are already integrated with QuickBooks Online. And so what we can do for the time being is like you can. Always. Sorry, one second, you can always download and upload CSVs and we can handle that for you to get you initially set up and sort of do. And what we do is like have like an AI agent kind of go in and We'll give you a CSV format and then we can pull it from QuickBooks. For those ones that we don't have a native integration for, we create a 2025 type integration where we can set it up for you and our customers.
Jason: How does that look? Can you give me an example of how it would do with the CSV file?
Christian Sheerer: You'd pull CSV from QuickBooks with your customer information, And then on some cadence, we'll pull it in and then you'll be able to just grab all those invoices that get pulled in and then send out those payment requests.
Jason: Okay. I guess I'm just trying to visualize. So, like for example, every month we generate in QuickBooks 100 invoices. So there's a way to CSV those invoices out of QuickBooks and import them into this? Mm-. Oh, cool. Okay.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. And we can offer that as like a first step for you to get that set up.
Jason: Interesting. Okay. But hopefully in the near future or some point in the future, there'll be a little more seamless integration with QuickBooks Desktop.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. Where we have it online is we just link it and it'll open up a tab to sign into QuickBooks. That's what this is doing in another window here.
Jason: Gotcha.
Christian Sheerer: And then you just link it. But yes, the same thing will be available for Desktop. That's been something that's in the works since I got here a couple of months ago, and they've been really tinkering on that. So I don't have an exact date. We should have one pretty soon, but I would not put it too far after the end of the year.
Jason: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah.
Jason: All right. Now, what about the reverse? So we generate the invoices, we send the pay links out. When the customer actually clicks the link and pays their invoice that was generated, how does it then get back in the QuickBooks? For.
Christian Sheerer: For them or for you?
Jason: For me, you'll have you.
Christian Sheerer: You just come here and you download this CSV, and then you just put that up into. Into QuickBooks. It should be mapped pretty well according to how the erps handle them.
Jason: Okay, so it'll be a CSV each way. Interesting. Okay. Is there a way to generate, like, some other platform to look at? There's like a. Just a pay link that you send the customer and when they. When they click on that, they log in with their information and it kind of shows their available invoices and they can pay them.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, yeah, that's what's happening here. So I don't have any other invoices that are unpaid for this version of Christian, but yeah, yeah, same thing. So they'll go in, it's not like that they necessarily have a customer portal. It's that I'll go in, Let me see one of these links. I want to make sure I'm using mine. Let's see this one. See if I copy this link, open it up. Yeah, see they'll see their other unpaid invoices.
Jason: Okay. So it does show any open invoices they have.
Christian Sheerer: Exactly. But this is a separate link, right? They'll just have to click into it. And so then they, yeah.
Jason: Okay. Okay. I get it. All right. So I saw you real quick. So you went back and I saw you copy the link. Is there a way to do that instead of emailing the customer directly? And the reason I ask is I would actually, if we could, I'd like to use QuickBooks to still send out our invoices, but we can embed the generated payment link that's from this website.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, yeah, 100%. So people do that. And that might be a good, For people who have online and we just integrate directly, that's an extra step that I would recommend they not take. But for you, that might be a good way to just keep everything all in one spot so you don't have to do the extra step of CSV back. It's not that arduous, it's download/upload. But you're thinking in the right way where you can, yes, exactly. Copy it. Let's do that from the beginning. I'll just create a new invoice. Or one of my split personalities and do 1000 or whatever it is. Create, yeah, and I can manually share it. So I can copy that, put that anywhere.
Jason: Cool. But I think I still, if possible, I'm just kind of thinking through this. I'm sure it'll make more sense once I do it. But I'm thinking, I still cleared all the invoices in QuickBooks. I export to CSV, import it into here, which generates the actual pay side of it. And then I can go into each one and copy the link out and then just paste it to the invoice that's generated in QuickBooks. Does that make sense? It would be like a back and forth twice. Yep.
Christian Sheerer: Yep. You're thinking about the exact right way.
Jason: Okay. So yeah, that way the invoices already exist in QuickBooks. We export to get the payment side of it generated. And then we just plug those links into before we mail them out. And that way they're embedded in each.
Christian Sheerer: Invoice when the customer gets them. Yeah, yes, sir. Okay, cool. And then that way you'll have, you'll still be able to, and you can.
Jason: Always track them in here, right?
Christian Sheerer: Like if I go to this guy, 10,000, I can mark it as paid. And so I updated it, that payment link is done and should show up here somewhere.
Jason: Yes, like somebody decides they don't want to pay their credit card, they just send in a check, then we can. Just go in and manually mark it as paid. Okay.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, that's for those stragglers who are still, you know, still want to stay on checks, stuff like that. Right. Right.
Jason: But they'll have the option when they click on the link, they could just pay by ACH or credit card, if I remember correctly. Mm-.
Christian Sheerer: Yep, exactly.
Jason: Awesome. Okay, that all makes sense.
Christian Sheerer: Let me just look through your questions again, unless you remember them off the top.
Jason: So it was the fees, minimum commitment of term requirements. I don't think you hit on that one yet.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, that's because you're going to use it forever. Never let you out of it. Of course. Because why is that even a question? You use it forever. No, people generally do once they get up and go and stick around. But the actual legalities of it are, Year long commitment if you want at 35 a month. And so that's a little bit discounted on the month to month commitment. So like month to month commitment is 45, meaning no year long situation, but 20% more.
Jason: Right, I got you. Now, other than the max transaction fee, what's the difference between the free tier and then the 35 a month one?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, a couple things.
Jason: There are.
Christian Sheerer: A limited amount of users at your company that can interact with the system. So there's three Macs on the free tier. You can not schedule payments on the free tier. You can schedule payments in the future. Can't do recurring in the free tier either.
Jason: Okay, what is scheduling? What would that be?
Christian Sheerer: So that would just be like, I want to get ahead of all the payments that are coming up, either AP or AR, and I just want to do it on the first. I know the same things are going to happen and I'm going to do it for, you know, two months from now. That is like, I think maybe not exactly something that would fit exactly your use case. That's for we got our start with large industrial businesses who like are scheduling out jobs six months in advance.
Jason: I got you.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah.
Jason: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: Um, and that's a, that's a bulk of our bigger customers. And so that's where, that's where that comes in. But I think for you, the, the, the one difference that I'd be aware of is like no recurring payments on the, on the free tier, as well as the turnaround times are about a day fast or are a day faster. Uh, two days ACH, versus three on the free tier and one day for credit card versus two, on the free tier.
Jason: Okay, now on the reoccurring part of it, obviously we do have reoccurring charges. However, our reoccurring charges do change or can change month to month depending on if anything, any activity during that month or whatever time period. So we do have to touch each invoice before we reoccur it, so to speak. So if we did use reoccurring, is there a way to actually edit the amount before it goes out on that reoccurring transaction?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, yeah. I would just do, I just make sure you're tracking them, right? So this one, for example, we made that reoccurring one just now. I can always go in and edit an invoice and now make it 9000 instead of 10.
Jason: Right. You would just have to do it before it hits the reoccurring date.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, exactly. If I save that, there is definitely a cooler way I could have shown that. But basically that's the same link and now it's 9000. I'll show you the cooler way. If I want to change that from 9000, I could do, here we're going to make that 8000 and I'll save the changes. Now when I go into that link, It's 8000.
Jason: Gotcha. It's dynamic. And I didn't think about this before, but is there any way to reflect the invoice number from our side in there? Or is it just an amount?
Christian Sheerer: So yeah, so that would be a function of this sort of integration. And like the CSV download upload.
Jason: Gotcha. So when we do the CSV, there will be a field for invoice number. Okay. I'm just thinking, the user can accumulate all these charges and we won't really know what's what if we can't link it back to invoice number on our side.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, exactly. And you can always write a note and you can always drag in an invoice that's coming from QuickBooks if you're sending it out via Nickel via this link. Gotcha. Which with all documentation. So if I wanted to put in something here, So I'm editing this one that we already have on that link. So I've updated that payment link. I'll go in now, I have that PDF, which is this.
Jason: Oh, that's cool. Okay.
Christian Sheerer: Sure that I had, but yeah.
Jason: So we can attach our invoices to that. Okay. So when that's emailed out to the customer, the payment request, can we customize the from address?
Christian Sheerer: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. I got all the customizations for.
Jason: Okay, perfect.
Christian Sheerer: This is the nickel, one of the old nickel logos.
Jason: Great. So we can brand the site and everything.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, 100%.
Jason: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: 100%. And you can also set up like a payments portal. This is a little bit less one to one. This is for like straggler payments that people just need to like, oh, Damn, I owe Jason $3,000 or something and I don't want to wait for a link. I just want to pay my debts off or whatever, not debt, but whatever.
Jason: Yeah, I got you.
Christian Sheerer: You could bank bacon, a nickel payments link for or payments portal, sorry, branded with a banner and your logo and come in. So this is one of our customers, Chicago brass. And they just have that in there down there.
Jason: That would work if they just want to pay on their account. That was actually another thing I was looking for.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah.
Jason: Okay. Oh, they can put an invoice number or whatever. Got it.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, exactly.
Jason: And then once they click make payment, then it goes to that questionnaire of, you know, credit card check, that kind of stuff, right?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. Let me make sure I didn't put $1,000, but yeah, exactly.
Jason: Okay, cool. Oh, perfect. All right. And is there any way for the customer to elect to save their credit card information?
Christian Sheerer: So if you have, so let's go to customers. So I sent this person my second alter ego authorization form. So if you had it on file, you could add it and you entered in. But I can send a request for full permission, which just means like no limits, no expiration, or I can limit that to the amount that you guys have agreed to or whatever. And still set no expiration limit or set a time limit with no transaction limit, et cetera. And then they'll send a request. Oh, you got to put a reason. And then it'll send a request. Oh, excuse me. And they'll be able to go and complete that payment method form. And they'll get some nice information about what Nickel does for security, what they can do in terms of revoking it. So they can always revoke it, obviously.
Jason: And.
Christian Sheerer: Review the terms that you set up, like 1000 transaction limit on this expiration date and terms and conditions of Nickel, just so they are understanding and then they'll authorize once they've read throughout all of those stuff, all of those things.
Jason: Gotcha. And do we have the ability to customize that in any way at our own disclaimers or anything?
Christian Sheerer: What do you mean?
Jason: Like for example, if I wanted to send them this request form, but I wanted to also include something that says, you know, like in some instances, you know, they pay by check, but if they don't pay after so many days, then that authorizes us to go ahead and charge the card for the amount or something like that.
Christian Sheerer: Honestly, that's a really good note. I don't believe so today.
Jason: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: Where you could bake that in. I would say that probably is two-step communication as of right now, wherein you'd have that agreement. Typically when people are sending authorization forms, it doesn't just come like, oh, here's a Nickel authorization form. They have some conversation with them about it. And so I think that's, so this is also a link, right? So I think that might be, you could kill those two birds with a single line of communication, which is like, hey, you have this services agreement that you set up with them, which is you can pay, if it's late, then we can just authorize it.
Jason: Gotcha.
Christian Sheerer: And so then give us that authorization up to that certain amount up to X number of days. And then they got to say, yeah or no. Or they still have to go through the authorization form and acknowledge it.
Jason: Okay. Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: So I think that might be a way to tinker with it.
Jason: Okay. All right. That sounds like a potential. All right. What else do we have? I'm looking at my list here. I think you hit on all the important stuff.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah.
Jason: All right. Is there anything additional that you want to make sure I know about? Let me think. Not really.
Christian Sheerer: I was trying to see it.
Jason: I was going to say, Thomas, show it off.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, like we get so, I mean, the other thing we didn't talk about is vendors. You pay a lot of vendors?
Jason: I wouldn't say a lot, but yeah, we do have vendors that we pay.
Christian Sheerer: It's really the same process too. Bills come in, you can go out, make a new bill, create recurring bills. I think the real, I don't know, technical and fun parts of this are happening on the back end, right? Nicholas kind of see it as it is, right? It's like super intuitive for people to use, makes my job pretty fun because then the most of the time that I'm talking with people is like around like, oh, you know, I have this authorization that I want to do past a certain due date. If it's overdue, then I can authorize it. And that's like where I get to work with people to think how they'd make the most of it. But the actual like tech sitting on top of the deep infrastructure is complicated. Or the actual tech is simple, the deep infrastructure is complicated. But our idea is if we could do that deep infrastructure without having to let our customers worry about it, then they have one place to centralize all of their payments. We think of payments, the lifeblood of any industry and any business. And so if we're the, excuse this wild analogy, but the cardiovascular system, if we're the heart of it, then It makes it a lot easier for people to know where they need to go check on their heart. It's just like this one nickel spot.
Jason: I gotcha.
Christian Sheerer: And so that's where we sort of think about AR and AP together. And our typical process is, I worked at software places where we would gear people up for like, Hey, get ready for four weeks of setting this up. And it might take you that amount of time to get everything kind of wrapped in and that you're familiar with as gravy train and you're sending out invoices and pulling in vendor bills and sending those out. But it really takes around an hour, an hour and a half to set up. And so typically what we do is given the familiarity is pretty high and the comfortability to use it, and it sounds like it is on your side, is we schedule time in about a week's time to see how those first couple of transactions go and give you a homework of running a couple transactions to get familiar with the system and then work through any things that we need to do on the QuickBooks side in those edge case scenarios where people aren't using QuickBooks online. And then we come back together troubleshoot, check in, if everything's good to go, then we can explore maybe different parts of the platform that you didn't start off with and work on it that way.
Jason: Okay. So circling back to the AP side of it. So help me understand what would be the advantage in my situation to use this to make my payments instead of just paying them straight out of QuickBooks? For my vendors.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, I think QuickBooks still charging 1% on ACH.
Jason: Oh, I get it. Okay.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah.
Jason: Most of my vendors, if not all of them, we pay by credit card. So it's literally just, you know, they charge the card and I just enter the transaction in QuickBooks. But yeah, I can see what you're saying for the ACH.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. And I mean, the card also were 2.9% going out for AP.
Jason: So.
Christian Sheerer: They might be advantageous compared to what you're getting now.
Jason: Gotcha. Okay. All right. Well, I'll definitely keep that in mind. Good to know.
Christian Sheerer: And then I think it's like a centralization function, right? It's like being able to see everything in one spot and having it both flow through AP and AR. You have one dashboard to make all payments. I think it's a time saving thing too, right? Which is like, okay. I need to do AR and AP today. I'm gonna go into nickel, make sure all of it's done on both ends, and then you don't have to juggle between two different systems.
Jason: Yeah, that makes sense. Awesome. Okay, well, I think the next step for me would be I wanna do some transactions. Is there any way I can set up like some dummy accounts to play with this?
Christian Sheerer: So I would just say get started with a real account. It's 14 days free. On the beginning. And so, yeah, there's no risk there. I would start up with a real account. You just have to log in, connect your bank account, run some transactions, and then we can set up time in about a week or early next week. Takes two days for the ACH to process. So I'd say Tuesday we could get back together or Wednesday or whenever, and then check in how those went. And if there's anything that we need to put our heads together about, we can schedule that time. To use that time for that.
Jason: All right. So what about the CSV transfer and customizing and things like that?
Christian Sheerer: That's another homework thing that I need to do, which I will have to recap for you and send over what we need to get from you to be able to make that happen. And so those would be the kind of things that we would use that time for when we get back together next is like, Let's check off the QuickBooks thing. Let's make sure transactions were flowing smoothly. And then third is if we need to troubleshoot anything, plus think through a different workflow that you guys have.
Jason: Bake.
Christian Sheerer: That into the agenda as well.
Jason: All right. Well, let's go ahead and get that set up and we'll be ready for that.
Christian Sheerer: All right. Awesome. Yeah. And I just need to go to my engineering team to kind of give me a download on what we need to send over to you for the enterprise bit. And does like Tuesday of next week work or Wednesday?
Jason: Let me see here. Let's, Wednesday's not good. Let me look at Tuesday. Yeah, let's go ahead and do Tuesday afternoon if we could.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, is the same time work?
Jason: Yeah, that'd be fine.
Christian Sheerer: Where are you?
Jason: I'm central. I'm in Louisiana.
Christian Sheerer: Oh, awesome.
Jason: How about you? West Coast?
Christian Sheerer: We're on the East Coast. We're in Brooklyn.
Jason: Oh, cool. Yeah. So I try to keep up, but y'all chilly or warm up there right now? I think y'all flipped.
Christian Sheerer: It just flipped into like really nice actually. It was a little bit rainy today, but it's like autumn in New York. That's like a famous jazz standard. So it's like, that's a real thing. It's like, you know, that's, that's really what it is right now. It just got in. It's like a, you know, 70s, high 60s.
Jason: It's beautiful. Oh, that's awesome.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah.
Jason: I think I saw something maybe last.
Christian Sheerer: Week or earlier this week that y'all had some Frost at some point. Oh, yeah, yeah, maybe. Maybe up north. I mean, like, yeah, I started to put on a jacket, which is nice.
Jason: I'm from Florida, so, like, if anything goes below 70 degrees, I'm putting on a jacket. I'm with you, man. I can't stand the cold weather.
Christian Sheerer: That's why I live down here. Yeah. Where? Where in Louisiana
Jason: are you? I'm in New Orleans. Oh, awesome. I'm way down there. That is like one of my favorite cities in the world that I've ever been to. Yeah, it's really fun. I mean, if you're in the jazz and you like the festivals and like you said, you talk about fall and spring, I mean, it's a beautiful time to come in the city and see things.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, we did the whole natural senior year of college Mardi Gras thing. And so, you can imagine how that went. Been there. And it was incredible, but it was wild. And so I kind of want to go see it from another kind of more mature perspective as well. Just, you know, get haunted by the ghosts that are floating around, but with a clear head, you know?
Jason: Yeah, yeah. No, we actually get out of town from Watergro. It's a great place when you're young, but as you get older, it just, you know, it kind of gets old. Yeah, so it's just like, Hey, come on in, bring your tax dollars. We're going to take a little vacation.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, I hear you. I hear you.
Jason: Cool.
Christian Sheerer: I don't know. People in New Orleans, are they, are they LSU fans or.
Jason: No, pretty much. Yeah. I mean, we've got two Lane as well, but, but, yeah, it's pretty much hardcore LSU.
Christian Sheerer: Cool.
Jason: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: How are we feeling about LSU this year?
Jason: Ah, you know, jury's still out, but I don't know if it's going to be as good as last year. We'll see.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. I mean, I mean, like, I like college football when LSU is good, so.
Jason: Right, exactly. So we'll see what happens. But yeah, but all good. All right, I got your meeting requests. I'm gonna reply to that and look forward to getting back together with you next week.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, give me a little bit to get my homework done for the day and then yeah, you'll have my contact if anything comes up. Hit me up.
Jason: All right, now how does Colton fit into this? Who do I- yeah, yeah.
Christian Sheerer: So you can deal with me directly for now. Colton is our onboarding customer success manager. He deals with existing clients. Primarily dealing with new business people are interfacing with us for the first time, helping them get set up. And so you'll get reintroduced back to him when we go through and everything's comfortable and you're familiar and you're using the platform. And then he'll help you sketch out regular check-ins, maybe not every month, but every quarter or something, and make sure that, and if new things happen at Nickel, he'll be there to communicate like, Hey, we just actually launched the API with QuickBooks Desktop, or down the line, Hey, we just launched this new feature that you might want to use. And so that's sort of his role. Okay, awesome.
Jason: Sounds like a plan.
Christian Sheerer: But we're a small team, so if you forget that I just said that and you email one of us, we all see everything. Gotcha.
Jason: Okay, sounds like a winner. I appreciate it. All right, Jason.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, it was really nice to meet you and I will see you next week.
Jason: Okay, sounds great, man.
Christian Sheerer: Have a good one. Yeah, you too.
Jason: Have a good weekend. All right, bye. Bye.
