Jacob Greenberg: Hey Bryce, can you hear me?
BryceW: Yeah.
Bryce Jr.: Hey Jacob, sorry couldn't find the unmute button there, but yeah, I can hear. I think everyone's jumping on Mike and the Bryce Sr.
BryceW: I guess.
Jacob Greenberg: Cool. We can give them a second to go in. How's everything going on your end?
Bryce Jr.: It's good. It's good. Busy day. I'm sure you're probably got the same, but, yeah, that's a good thing. So. Are you in New York, you said, or are you.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, we're. We're over here. We're based in Brooklyn.
Bryce Jr.: Oh, nice.
Jacob Greenberg: And you guys are DC, correct?
Bryce Jr.: Yeah, DC.
Jacob Greenberg: Nice.
BryceW: Yeah. So.
Jacob Greenberg: Pulling up my notes from our last call. Have you guys had a chance to log into the platform and start testing it out, or is this going to be a review one more time before we help you get set up?
Bryce Jr.: So I have, I have signed up, but to be honest, I think I'm the only one who's really been poking around in it and, like, looking at getting set up. I connected the account on the free version and just looking at screens and getting comfortable. But I don't think the other guys have, so they might have a few more questions. We haven't had an opportunity to kind of look at it together.
Jacob Greenberg: After poking around a little bit, do you feel confident in using it?
Bryce Jr.: Yeah, for sure. I think the one thing that I might need your help with this. So if we have sales people, because we've got maybe five or six sales.
Jacob Greenberg: People who will.
Bryce Jr.: Be interacting with customers, sending requests for payment essentially, and what their view might look like. I know I saw the three permission levels in there. Just getting a feel for how we might have them use it versus.
BryceW: Workplace.
MikeW: Hey, Josh, do I have to go to Circleback to get on this? It's asking me to create an account for a seven-day trial.
Bryce Jr.: You shouldn't have to, Mike. I think, let me. I'll forward you it again. I didn't have to do that. Okay, I'll send it to you.
Jacob Greenberg: Hey guys, how's everyone doing?
BryceW: Hey Jacob, how you doing?
Jacob Greenberg: So far so good, busy day over here. Bryce was saying same for you guys.
BryceW: Good, good.
Jacob Greenberg: Sending that to Mike, hopefully. Hopefully we can get to that.
Bryce Jr.: I think Lori was going to join too. Our bookkeeper might also join just for awareness. But Here, muted then.
BryceW: Let me go ask Lori if she's coming on.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay. Send it again to her.
BryceW: She's joining.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, great. So Bryce Jr. told me that he had a chance to log in and play around a little inside the platform. You haven't had that same opportunity yet, have you?
BryceW: He showed me a little of it. Yeah, he did. Okay, cool. Now, Bryce, are we still like the free one or is this the one we pay $35 for?
Bryce Jr.: That's the free one. But, you know.
BryceW: Yeah. Does it come with all the features?
Bryce Jr.: No, there are limitations and, but I mean, that you get the feel for most of it is what I'm understanding.
MikeW: If we're gonna go with the Jacob, sorry, I think I called you Josh earlier. I had another meeting with the Josh this morning, but, I mean, we have basically talked about this. If all said, are we missing something by doing the seven day? You're saying, do the seven day, but is it different? And don't we want to try it the way it is? And if in. 30 days we don't like it or seven days we don't like it. We just pay the $35 and go away.
Jacob Greenberg: You're talking about testing out like the free trial. Is that what you're referring to, Mike?
MikeW: I could care less about $35. I don't want to be that way, but it's like if there's a difference between what we would get on the free versus what we get on the premium, if there's a difference, I'm willing to do a trial for $35 if you don't get pissed off at us if in a month we're like, we hate this.
Jacob Greenberg: No worries because here I'll show you the pricing page here, but I have no fears that once you guys start testing it out, you're going to end up leaving. It's a really easy to use platform and we have nothing but satisfied customers at this point.
MikeW: I don't want to jump over Bryce and them. They're the ones doing all the work and I'm just asking for stuff. But I mean, is he gonna have to do more work on the $35 platform in a week?
Jacob Greenberg: So I'll give you guys the whole layout. It's really basic. Right now you signed up with the free account, which is called Nickel Core. The difference between Core and Plus is there's a few things. One is the turnaround times are one day faster on Nickel Plus. So for ACH, the turnaround times would be two days. For credit card, it's next day turnaround. But on Nickel's AskElephant Notetaker, it's a three-day turnaround for ACH and a two-day turnaround for credit card. So that's the first point. The second point is that there is a limit per transaction on Nickel's AskElephant Notetaker of $25,000 per transaction. So if you're doing transactions greater than that, you're going to want to upgrade to Plus. A lot of customers that I work with, taking the same path that you guys are right now, Sign up with Nickel Core, it's free, they play around with it when they're ready to do a larger transaction and they know that they're gonna commit to this as a business process for themselves, well upgrade to Nickel Plus. Now, for Nickel Plus, if you do sign up, you have a two week free trial. If you want to pay on a monthly cadence, it's $45 a month and you could cancel at any time and just not renew the subscription. But we also have a save 20% Discount where it's $35 a month, but you pay for the year upfront. So a couple different options there. Seems like if you guys want a little more flexibility, you might want to start with core, which you already have done. And when you're ready to upgrade, you can upgrade to Nickel Plus on the monthly plan. Will we see any difference other than those things?
MikeW: Is the desktop still the same? Can we do that?
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, everything's the same besides those. There's a couple little hidden gem features in there. One is like you can have an unlimited amount of users. Within Nickel, you can create different user types and add different email accounts to access your account. If Lori wants to have her own account, Mike, you want to have your own account for the sales guys there. Bryce, you guys want to have your account as well. There's more than three people with special permissions you want to give to each person. You might want to use Nickel Plus for that. You do get three seats, though, in Nickel Core. If you wanted to create one seat for the sales team, one seat for, like, administrative management, one seat for accounting. That's a good. You can start there on nickel core. And then recurring payments. If you guys wanted to do bill pay for some recurring payments and setting up that feature, that comes with Nickel Plus.
MikeW: So Bryce and Bryce, you make the decision. But, you know, I guess we've got to do follow up on other stuff, but if you approve this, wouldn't it just be wise to do maybe the $45 a month to month? And then after two weeks to a month, you like it, you go to the 35. I think Jacob, you said we could shift a month to month and then achieve the discounted rate once we go to a contract.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, whenever you guys want to sign up, it's essentially $420 for a year. There's a 20% discount if you sign.
BryceW: Up.
Jacob Greenberg: To pay it upfront to pay the year at a time.
MikeW: And if we cancel, does it rebate what we don't use or are we on the hook for all 12 months?
Jacob Greenberg: It's a one-time payment if you want to pay for the full year with the discount. There's no returns on it. But if you wanted to do month-to-month, that's also an option as well.
MikeW: Well, maybe you can do a couple months for month-to-month. What do you guys think?
BryceW: I think the big concern would be we have enough credit or what we can, the size of the transaction is not going to be capped. We want the bigger transaction. And then from my perspective, the one that has the best back office functionality, reports or whatnot, that's another concern is that it's going to be.
Jacob Greenberg: You know.
BryceW: Hard to reconcile things just suddenly hitting this account. We want, you know, like end of day reports and that type of thing we can print off so we know what we're looking at. That would be my 2 concerns. If that's what you get with the more money, then the money seems reasonable. Either 45 or 35 doesn't matter.
MikeW: But, well, maybe the 45 is where you go because you don't get a refund if in 2 months you want to you want to go a different direction, there's no limitation on you for you're spending $10 more for a month or two if you go that way and that gives you the free hand to do it. Otherwise, you're on the hook for 400 bucks and you won't get that back if you decide to leave. Not that I think we're going to leave, but I'm just trying to be pragmatic and would I rather it's like a $10 a month insurance policy.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, I think in your case, if you guys are still feeling like testing the waters, but want to get the most out of the features for your use case, I think my recommendation would be sign up just for, you know, one month, use the free trial. It'd be $45 for your first month after that. So essentially you get six weeks for $45. At the end of the six weeks, I think you guys are going to have a pretty firm understanding of being able to commit to this or not. And then at that point, if you want to sign up and save the extra hundred, $20 throughout the year, you can sign up for the whole year platform.
MikeW: Well, we have limitations if we do that. So for the next month, I'd like to think we're going to have more than 25,000. We're going to have a couple.
Jacob Greenberg: Oh, nope, there would be no limitations. So I'm just talking about upgrading now to do the trial for the Plus version. You'll automatically get on Plus. You'll get all the features with Plus. Do it.
MikeW: Yeah, you're saying upgrade to the $45 month-to-month, right? Not just go on the $0 Seven day, right?
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah. If you want to get all the features and on cap the transaction limit, do one month. It's essentially six weeks because 14 days are free. And then after that, if you think it's going to be good for your operations, if you want to save that extra $120 a year and you're going to commit to using it for a year internally, you can feel free at that point to upgrade and pay.
MikeW: Okay.
BryceW: Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: But you'll get all the features once you do the month.
MikeW: So if we were to go ahead, Bryce, are you, you know, we've got like three or four questions Bryce Jr. Has, I think, that he wanted to go through.
Jacob Greenberg: And.
MikeW: But if you wanted to go ahead, where are you leaning, Bryce?
Jacob Greenberg: $45.
BryceW: Yeah, yeah, that would be the better one. I would go $45. Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: All right.
MikeW: So, Bryce, why don't you lead the way on the questions since you had them written down. I'm sure you've talked to your dad. He might have added some.
Bryce Jr.: Yeah, we didn't get too much time to circle up, but some of the stuff is like probably best practices Jacob, so it might not be like there's a real set answer, but for our use case. But I guess one thing we talked about was the website thing with our having the Chicago brass like feature on the website. And you mentioned that was pretty easy. Is there anything, if we go ahead with the $45 version, What would we need to do to basically get that accomplished? Is that something we should go to our IT team?
Jacob Greenberg: Great question. It's very easy to do. I'll walk you through it. This depends on how you guys built your website, just how you want to plug it on your website. But if you have an IT team that custom built it, you just send them a message with the link you want them to include. If you guys use a web builder, it's super duper easy. To get started. Okay.
MikeW: Is there a video on how to do this or would we get our, I mean, I'd rather not do this, I'd rather, and don't we get a concierge person for setup when we go to the $45?
BryceW: Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: So here's the other components of this. Once you guys sign up with the platform, you're going to get a customer success manager who's going to support you guys through your entire onboarding process. So you get to pick the plan for onboarding. It comes at no additional cost. It's just based on your urgency. So we can onboard you guys in a day, in a week, in a month, or in three months based on what your preference is. Really, this just takes like an hour or two of the team all together really focused on it to get onboard within the hour and a half. It's pretty easy to use. But you also, Mike, that's a good question. You'll have the Customer Success team to help you guys through onboarding. Make sure everything's set up the way you want to. After you're onboarded, we have a lot of other options to get continual support. This is our Knowledge Center right here. Essentially, every single question we've ever been asked or all the technical documentations that when people ask me technical questions, it's stored here. It's really easy to find. We also have, let's see. We also have a YouTube page with all the demonstration videos. You can also access that from within this portal as well. But we also have a chat box. So we'll have an intercom. Message, so right here is where you're going to be able to message support. And they're usually really quick to get back. Right now, Thomas is going to realize that this is coming from me, so he just thinks I'm messing around in it. But they're live, so you'll have direct support here. You'll have a customer success manager to get you onboarded. It's very, very easy to do self-service, but we have really quick response times as well. For the payment portal, BryceW, Bryce Jr. Pop into here and you'll see this right away on your payment portal. Under invoices on the get paid section, you just click this link and this would be your link. We create the domain for you automatically. Once you create an account, see this says Nickel demo staging. That's because I'm in my demo environment. This instead would say Weaver or Weaver Hardware, whatever you guys want to put here. And then that would be your domain. And then wherever you want to share this domain, people can access it. So you can copy this link and embed it as a button on your website. You can even print out like a QR code and people can scan it and go straight to this page. Or you could just put it as a, you know, domain name listed on any of your outbound materials.
MikeW: So you can put a QR code on your sales counter and have people pay for it that way, right?
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah. Interesting.
MikeW: We hadn't thought about that.
Jacob Greenberg: Yep. You can do really whatever you want. I've been playing around with the Dippin' Dots logo because I like colors, but these would be your logo, your branding. It'd look like your store. Cool.
Bryce Jr.: Okay. That's easy. So we can definitely.
MikeW: Bryce, can you make a note that we want to put, I think we want to put a QR code. Bryce, we'll talk about it. Do we want to put a QR code on the front counter?
BryceW: Are you talking to me? Yeah.
MikeW: I mean, it's a question.
BryceW: Yeah. That's something I think it's, well, we do have, currently we still have the swipers because, you know, we have, We can do the smaller point of sale transactions, you know, that way.
MikeW: You could always put American Express QR code here.
BryceW: I mean, you could put it there.
MikeW: You know, a lot of our- It might be interesting to see how well it did.
BryceW: There'll be some people walk in and want to use that, others don't, you.
MikeW: Know, because- Well, and you're not going to be in the ERP system, so it may not make sense. So that's a side issue, but you probably just might make a note of it so that we can talk about it later on.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay. All right.
Bryce Jr.: And then, so that's easy. I think one thing we, maybe this.
MikeW: Is for the.
Bryce Jr.: What'S it called, the onboarding experience. But one thing I was curious about is like the crediting process. Like what does it look like if we were to credit back a customer? I was poking through the screens and I was having a little bit of just difficulty I wanted to make sure that that kind of looks easy.
Jacob Greenberg: You're talking about your trade credit, if you're extending credit to a customer.
Bryce Jr.: I'm more so talking about, say, refunds. That's the word I should use. Or someone returns something to us and we're giving them money, that credit back. It could be a month after the original transaction and they've returned something. And trying to give them basically back the money for the merchandise they returned.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, essentially all the refunds would populate here on the transactions tab to manage it. When you've received the payment, you'll be able to, so if you're refunding the customer completely, you'd just be able to click it for a refund. If you're sending like a partial reimbursement, you would just create a new bill pay. To that customer.
MikeW: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: It would be like sending a transaction statement.
Bryce Jr.: Gotcha. So like a new.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay. All right.
Bryce Jr.: And then is there like a way that you can quickly show us in the demo, like what if I'm like at the various permission levels, like what your screen might look like, or is that something we should toy with ourselves? I don't know if it's easy to show that, but I'm curious what a manager versus what a member can do.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, that's a great question. I'll just show you the permissions here and you can see.
Bryce Jr.: Okay.
BryceW: Cool.
Bryce Jr.: Okay, I didn't see that screen.
MikeW: Where did you access it from? Where's the tab?
Jacob Greenberg: It's right here. So if you go into account settings on the bottom left, and you go into members, you'll be able to click into this and upload any new member by adding invite, and you'll add their email account so that they could create their own account and log in. And then you'll be able to select whether it is an administrator, a manager, or a member. Now, for each of these accounts, you could customize the permissions, and I'll show you how to do that as well. But essentially, administrators have full access to everything. They can see everything, they could do anything. Managers can perform certain tasks, so they'll be able to transfer funds, for example, but they can't make any important changes to the bank account information or general account information within Nickel. And then you could also have members and members have restricted access so you can decide what they see and what they don't see. And they can't perform specific actions that result in money actually getting moved unless you have a unique workflow built out for that. So it's really just about controlling what different people on the team can do. So for example, if you had sales reps that want to generate invoices from within Nickel, you could add them as a member. They could generate the invoice and send it to a customer just by having the customer contact info and the amount of money that is required to be paid. And they could send that request to the customer, but the sales reps wouldn't have access to make payments from your account or to update any information or see any information about the bank, stuff like that.
Bryce Jr.: Okay, that's great. Yeah, I think that's a big one.
BryceW: Jacob, can I ask a question there? The view that we saw on the website for Chicago Brass looked very clean, simple, easy. I think it was just amount and invoice number. Is that something that also has options to it and they've just scaled it back to that?
Jacob Greenberg: That's a great question, Bryce. Yeah, so this is like, the out-of-the-box template that we offer. So if you click the Payments Portal link, you would just have these two features, very scaled back or two fields to fill out. If you want, though, we can, upon your request, build custom forms for you to show here. So if you did want to collect other information from your customers, just let me know once you sign up for the Plus Plan, which type of information fields you want us to add to this, and we can. What it would look like though, and maybe I could pull up an example actually. Give me one second here.
BryceW: How about, well, invoice number is fine, but name of sender or something.
MikeW: I think you could put invoice slash order, couldn't you, Bryce?
BryceW: Well, he's got reason for payment, so that's better than, you know.
MikeW: We could.
BryceW: Put order slash quote slash order number. And then maybe would be good to know who it is.
MikeW: I guess we don't. They're not going to have an invoice because it hasn't been invoiced yet. So you're right. It's quote and order.
BryceW: But a person's person's name would be helpful.
lorig: AR would be.
MikeW: That's true.
Jacob Greenberg: That's true.
MikeW: If we allowed them to pay, like a builder to pay all this.
BryceW: They're going to pay the fee.
MikeW: So, yeah, but I wouldn't have like an order number.
Jacob Greenberg: It would be a statement slash invoice.
BryceW: Well, see, that's why he's got it as reason for payment.
MikeW: Could we just put statement number?
BryceW: You could put reason for payment. Could there be another box that would.
MikeW: Say.
BryceW: Order slash quote or quote slash order number.
Jacob Greenberg: I feel like you don't want to.
Bryce Jr.: The whole point of this is to streamline it, right? If they don't know that and it's a required field, I mean, yeah, it's just going to make it more fresh.
lorig: You can take document number instead of reason for payment.
MikeW: Yeah, it doesn't say document on anything on the, on the, on the forms.
BryceW: But the potential frustration of not having enough information.
MikeW: All right, we'll figure, don't you think we figure that? I mean, I. I think you put order slash code. I don't know what the problem with that is.
BryceW: Yeah.
Bryce Jr.: They're going to sign out for an.
BryceW: AR payment or something you want to have.
lorig: We'll work that all out. That's kind of, yeah.
MikeW: Well, you can make a note, Bryce, that we've got to determine tagline description. What do you call that?
BryceW: Is that changeable, Jacob, the description of the box?
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, it is. Right now, I'm just building a custom form for you guys to show you what it might look like. Now, this isn't customized specifically for what you would end up doing at the end. I just wanted to show you some examples. This one you would put reason for payment. I didn't update that. But anyway, what I'm trying to show is that this might just be my demo environment. Giving me a hard time. But yeah, this would move to a second page, like it would slide over and then you could fill in whatever information you want. So.
lorig: Is there the chance to have a third line for name?
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, absolutely. That might be useful. So essentially you could add any type of field you want. You could do like a number field, a one sentence test field, a multi-line text box. You could upload documents if you want to. We could customize it for you, but we would build it from our end. Okay.
MikeW: I think name would be helpful.
Bryce Jr.: Would we not capture that like in the payment though or is that, I guess, could be different?
lorig: A lot of the builders use their personal credit cards and not their company credit card.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, so this would be like the generic link that's on the website. So that, If you did want to capture people's names as they fill this out, that might be a wise decision. But another easy way is if you're sending out the invoice itself, then you would capture the customer information on the invoice from the get-go, right? So you put in their name and then you put in the cost, create it and send it out. And that would be, you know, it would already have the customer information in there and have any other previous transactions with you as well. But this is just the generic page that you plug in on your website, easy to access. If you wanted to capture the customer information like their name, you would put another tab here to have them fill out their name. Gotcha.
BryceW: Bryce, are you confident you know how to get that onto the website?
Bryce Jr.: Yeah, it was just a call to Bravo. Basically, you should have them embed the content somewhere, wherever you want. And I don't really know how they do it, but I think it should be straightforward. I'm sure that they've.
Jacob Greenberg: Done it.
BryceW: That should bring people to the website too.
Jacob Greenberg: That's good.
Bryce Jr.: I feel like one thing maybe this is good too, but I also think people are going to be using the links, like copying the link into an email. I've been toying with the difference between the two. And I don't know, Jacob, this is probably not a very easy question to answer, but in terms of a retail environment, do you see more people using this type of thing where people enter it themselves versus sending links, sending the email?
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, I think it depends on the environment that you guys have in your store specifically. So if people are walking in and buying little things, or if they're sort of standing there and talking with you guys for a long time, you're customizing your order and you're building relationship. It depends on that. But the truth is you have the option to do either. And what my, you know, if I was running that operation in person, my preference for bookkeeping sake would be to create the invoice, right? And, you know, add the new customer. So Bryce walks in and I'll say, All right, Bryce, let me send you a new invoice. What's your phone number or email address? And then you provide me the phone number or email. I'll select the item and the cost. And then I'll say, you know, this is for Bryce or don't even need to add notes. I'll put my contact in here. And you could, again, you could send this as a text message if you want to so they can just receive it in front of you. But it's as easy as entering their contact information, their name, and what they're purchasing, right? Gotcha. So once you do that, you can just create the link and send it to them. And then they'll be able to get the payment. They'll pay it on their phone right then and there. So it'd be customized to them. They'd see exactly what they're purchasing. They'd have the line items there. They'd have the invoice on their phone already. You could recall who you sold that to and when. And it takes like maybe five more seconds than just giving them the QR code. But if you have people making purchases online or it's a more generic purchase, you could have a QR code that just goes straight to this page and then they can pay from here.
Bryce Jr.: I think we have an internal conversation about the usage of the links versus that. I think from bookkeeping, because we're not linking to an ERP, it's almost like you want to control. If I send them a link, I can, put the number in, right? Like the invoice or the order number in versus them entering it. And if it's wrong, you know, we get the name, maybe it doesn't matter, but.
Jacob Greenberg: Exactly, exactly. Yeah, just another option. And then the other, you know, the third option here would be this link exists, but you guys use it internally, right? So someone comes up and they pay, whoever's behind the counter will go to this domain. Fill out the information really quickly and then click make payment and then enter the card information there. But yeah, I think sending invoices is going to be super easy to do. It takes a couple more seconds and then you capture all the information that you want to be able to capture. Gotcha.
Bryce Jr.: Yeah, I like it. That was the only other, that was the last question I had. So I don't know if anybody else has any Any questions that I like with what we're seeing?
BryceW: Yeah, I mean, from a, hey, Lori, from a perspective of making sense of all this, you know, from the reports and so forth, I mean, we're talking about, you know, double probably the volume of what we're used to doing with ACHs, you know, maybe more than that. So it's that confusion of and also making sure, checking off on it to make sure it has been posted since it's not integrated with the software.
Jacob Greenberg: Right.
BryceW: Do you see any, you know, do we, what would the end of day report look like if we, can we print it off like this is what the activity for the day? Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah. You absolutely could if you wanted to do it that way. Remind me, were you guys using QuickBooks or a different accounting system?
BryceW: A different accounting system. Yeah, it's like a proprietary type system.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. So if you did want to just get an end of day report, what you can do is it can be for active or completed, but you go into the transactions tab here. Let me find one that has a little bit more data for us. Give me one sec. So you've come into the transactions tab here. And then if you, so what type of report would you want? Just every single transaction that happened with that day and the staff.
lorig: We need that, yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: So you put in the date and you could just do today. I don't have any transactions from today, but that's how you would do it. Let me do another, like, I'll just do one for the month because I probably have more transactions out of there. So you guys would just go filter, date, today, and apply. And then you would just download this as a CSV.
lorig: Oh, perfect. Okay, that's what I was going to ask you. Can we do it?
Jacob Greenberg: All right.
BryceW: And is there enough on there? Let's see. You got a, that's our account name, right? Columbia National Association. There is a, we got a dollar amount. We have, what else do we have there?
lorig: You have who it's from?
Jacob Greenberg: Yep. In here you would have the date, the amount, the account it's coming from and going to, the money flow, so whether it's payable or receivables, the invoice number or the purpose of the invoice, the status of the transaction, whether it's been active or it's been you can complete it and settle. And another cool thing that if you wanted to, on each transaction level, you guys can come in here and add any notes about it that you want to, reminders about that transaction, or you could tag it as reconciled, or you could flag it for whichever reason you guys want. And those notes would also populate in the CSV download.
lorig: Okay. I think we need to talk about how it would be done because to get the cash to balance, you guys would have to be doing that part.
BryceW: I think it's part of the end of day procedure, right? Before going out, just print it off and then go out there.
lorig: Make sure the same amount. And then I can do the checking it off or against the paperwork and everything, but unless you want to give me the job of balancing your cash, which I don't think you want to do because I need shoes badly. Somebody's going to have to go through and make sure that you have that balance like you do with the current reports.
BryceW: Yeah, everything has to be posted so that we just know it's part of the end of the day procedure. We don't leave until we get it posted.
lorig: Now, if I'm gonna see this stuff first, I can post it, but I think your salespeople are gonna probably be wanting to post things too.
BryceW: What you could do, Lori, is if you do that, just print it off and have checks next to these transactions in case two more come in after you do it.
Jacob Greenberg: We would notice.
lorig: Yeah, I did the reconciled.
BryceW: Yeah. That little, Stick it in the drawer out there or something, you know, and you like you do the pick tickets, just stick it in there and we'd see it been closed.
Bryce Jr.: We can work out the process.
Jacob Greenberg: I think you're welcome.
lorig: Jacob doesn't need to be part of that part.
BryceW: Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: You guys can also, if you wanted to, and this is just an option, it might be easier to do a different way internally, but you can add invoices into here without sending that as a receipt to a customer and then just click mark as paid. So if you wanted to add all of your cash invoices onto this as a ledger just for transaction records, you can do that in here. And that way, when you download your end of the day report, you'll have everything that's like, this was a cash transaction, it's been paid. And these are also the, you know, ACH or credit card transactions as well. Just an offer. Yeah.
BryceW: Where does it say whether it's an ACH or a credit card on that report?
Jacob Greenberg: Yep. So here, I think I downloaded an example report. On this page before you download it, you'll be able to see by this icon here, this will be a card transaction, this will be a bank transaction, AC8. When it's downloaded, it looks more like this. One second. So many screens open, guys. I'm sorry. So you'll see the idea of the transaction. If it's payable or receivable, the reference number, when it was created, the status of the transaction, where the money came from or is going to. And you'll also see this column as payment map.
BryceW: Right?
Jacob Greenberg: So if it is coming straight from a bank, it would read as that bank information as ACA. If it's coming from a card company, it would say like Visa, MasterCard, Discover, credit card. All right.
BryceW: It looks pretty good.
Jacob Greenberg: And I do have to hop off here in four minutes, guys, to go to another meeting, but.
BryceW: Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: How do you guys feel about getting started? Is there anything I can do to support you? Would you want me to connect you with your customer success manager in advance?
BryceW: I feel comfortable moving forward and. As. Long as we, you know, have somebody who helps us get set up, I think we're fine.
Jacob Greenberg: Agreed? Yep. So you guys can go ahead, once you create the, I'll send a message over to our customer success team here, giving them a heads up that you guys do plan on signing up with the Plus account and getting moved forward. I know you wanted to start doing this this month, correct? Do you have a timeline that I can- As soon as possible, I think.
MikeW: Don't you, Bryce?
Jacob Greenberg: As soon as possible.
lorig: Absolutely.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay. So let me send out a message to the customer success team now. You guys can go ahead and sign up for the Plus Plan, as we discussed in the beginning of the call today. And I'll make sure that the second you guys are signed up, someone's going to be assigned to your account and we'll do a outreach to you. You can set up meetings with them for times that are convenient for you, or you can play around on your own before you have that meeting. But there'll be a resource to help you guys get activated, make sure that that payment link, the portal, is on your website the way you guys want to. Bryce Jr., if you have any questions about that, you'll be able to ask. And yeah, they'll offer more in-depth trainings if you have any certain parts of your procedures you want to review, like the cash deposit tracking, stuff like that. Good, sounds very good. So let me send them a message now. Go ahead and just let me know, Bryce, when you guys do sign up for the Plus Plan, do you guys plan on doing that today?
BryceW: Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: I think so, yeah. Okay, great. Let me just email everybody now. I'll do an email introduction between you guys and the Customer Success team. A little bit later this afternoon. Perfect.
Bryce Jr.: That sounds great.
Jacob Greenberg: Well, I'm excited for you guys to get going. In the meantime, feel free to reach out with any questions. And you also have your CSM guide to touch base with. Awesome.
Bryce Jr.: Thank you, Jacob.
Jacob Greenberg: All right, have a good one, y'all.
BryceW: All right, thanks.
lorig: Thank you.
