Gabe Emerson: Hi Eric.
Eric Nowoslawski: Hey, great to meet you.
Ivan LaBianca: Eric, Gabe, have you met Jenica from our team? I don't think so.
Eric Nowoslawski: Nice to meet you.
Ivan LaBianca: So, Jenica and I, how long have we worked together, Jenica? Was it like four years now?
Gabe Emerson: Yeah, I think it was starting pandemic time.
Ivan LaBianca: Yeah, so I have worked with Jenica in a bunch of different capacities and ended up bringing her on here at Nickel, but she used to do what Clay does by Leading a team of people by hand.
Eric Nowoslawski: Okay.
Gabe Emerson: Wow.
Ivan LaBianca: Very nice. Personalizing emails at scale for me to send.
Eric Nowoslawski: Great.
Ivan LaBianca: Yeah. So now she actually does stuff in Clay, does all sorts of different things. And I'm kind of onboarding her with Nicole. So just having her join on calls to learn as much as she can about everything.
Eric Nowoslawski: Great. Very nice.
Ivan LaBianca: Yeah.
Gabe Emerson: Happy to be here just to learn.
Ivan LaBianca: Yeah.
Eric Nowoslawski: Very nice. Well, so with the AWS outage, we're even still just kind of recovering. As well too. Hopefully today everything is fixed. You guys weren't really impacted, but other customers were. It took our focus away. The biggest thing is the new inboxes are in, they're spread across all of the active campaigns that we have right now. We got those leads from yesterday, still waiting on something to happen today. And then the spam test basically came back to, in my opinion, we just need to take the HTML of the bullet points out of the email. But other than that, those are like, and then I guess we'll get started on the catch-all campaigns now that we have this rocking and rolling too. So that's like the main update that I have unless Gabe has anything to add.
Gabe Emerson: No, that's it. And then I'm also, I think, I know Eric, I talked to you yesterday about potentially writing a new copy. We didn't get leads. I think I'm still going to do it anyways. Just to test it out.
Ivan LaBianca: Yeah. Test some new copy. Yeah. Why not? Yeah, I'd love to. I'm also curious about, I know we've talked about, maybe it seems like it's not a content thing, but, doing some maybe testing spin tax. No spin tax, but.
Eric Nowoslawski: Yes, for sure.
Ivan LaBianca: Yeah. I'm curious about the catch-all sounds like some burning boxes like crazy. So we'll see.
Gabe Emerson: Who knows?
Eric Nowoslawski: Maybe we haven't done it in a while. And maybe catch-all validation has really gotten much better that, you know, we can do it. We just usually throw them away, so we're interested, too.
Ivan LaBianca: Yeah.
Eric Nowoslawski: Yeah.
Ivan LaBianca: No, I I. I mean, if you were in your ideal world working with clients that were thinking long term, would you buy more domains and inboxes than you already do, or do you pretty much do it at the level that you think you should?
Eric Nowoslawski: Well, here's our new SOP. I always forget, oh yes, okay, great. I forget what keyboard shortcut I put it under. So we always buy more than what we think that we need. It's just, I think the real question more so is like, are we willing to risk any of that backup insurance inboxes that we have on catch all sending knowing that we're going to lose some to just spam as well too. So I would say we always overbuy but not for the purposes of catch all sending.
Ivan LaBianca: But excluding catch all, Would you overbuy more if you knew that you were going to work with someone long term? Is it better to buy earlier?
Eric Nowoslawski: So what then we do is, so we have customers, we have actually a lot of customers that have been with us for a year. And what we actually do is we replace their domains just like everybody else, but we actually overbuy, well, we replace the inboxes just like everybody else, but we actually overbuy on the domains more so that we can keep the budget like in line for them. But then the domains, instead of a domain being like a day old and then you put an inbox on it, the day, the domain is like maybe three months old. And then we put inboxes on it and we try to circulate that as often as we can around sales. So like once a quarter or so, Porcupine or Dynadot will have a nice sale going and then we will execute on that sale by a lot for people who need the domains. And then we have like, I mean, reddit.com has been working with us. We just signed literally the third year contract, which is kind of crazy. But so like for Reddit, we have a of domains just ready to go at all times.
Ivan LaBianca: So yeah. Yeah, that's okay. Yeah. Any idea? Like it is wild that we had three really solid ones come in yesterday and then it's just lumpy, I guess, huh?
Eric Nowoslawski: Yeah, I guess so, especially with these new inboxes. I mean, it's also day two today post AWS outage. So there's some other confounding variables, but yeah, it might be a little bit bumpy. Might just be a volume thing. We got to just check it out.
Ivan LaBianca: Cool. Yeah, I guess only things on my plate. Curious if it's worth Gabe as your AB testing. Something that I would be a little curious about is if we push to self-serve some of those experiments like the copy I sent, seeing if that has any of like if that works at all for us. Or just any other ideas you have, but yeah, I'm excited to see what these new inboxes do and what the catch-all does. It seems like we've got a pretty clear roadmap.
Gabe Emerson: Sure. And I know you sent over that copy. Would you be able to just put it back at the top of my Slack or whatnot so that I can, because I'll probably use part of that for the new copy we run.
Ivan LaBianca: Yes. Oh, and the other thing was if you got a price on just pure personal emails, no phones. Yeah.
Eric Nowoslawski: Gabe, it's the same. Just pull out the credits from the person.
Ivan LaBianca: It's the same. Yeah, yeah.
Eric Nowoslawski: Because it's all clay credits. Just pull out the estimate from the, like, just don't include the credits for the mobile phone numbers and it's the same price.
Gabe Emerson: Yeah, I'm just going to bring it up right now.
Eric Nowoslawski: Yeah, perfect.
Ivan LaBianca: I just put that at the or just reposted it and tagged you in the channel.
Gabe Emerson: Thank you. So it's telling me 11 per row for this one. But if I take out, you're saying take out mobile phone numbers?
Ivan LaBianca: Yeah, because mobiles are quite a bit more expensive, I think.
Eric Nowoslawski: Totally.
Gabe Emerson: Oh, yeah.
Ivan LaBianca: Because basically what I'm curious about is if we dump these lists into the connected TV campaign, what the match rate is. It's been interesting. Have you ever, I know Eric, you were curious about TV. Have you ever run TV ads for anyone or do you know people?
Eric Nowoslawski: Oh, I'm just as a marketer. Very curious.
Ivan LaBianca: Yeah, yeah. But do you have any experience with it?
Eric Nowoslawski: No, no, no, no. But I would love to know, like, especially from a startup, like, I don't really care about brand building TV ads because who cares about a brand building TV ad, but like a direct response, you know, startup TV ad, I think that's so interesting.
Ivan LaBianca: Yeah, so we do, I do care about the brand building in that our biggest objection is like, I've never heard of you. True.
Eric Nowoslawski: Yeah, yeah, that's true.
Ivan LaBianca: That's true. But what I'm seeing is we're so it's hard to track conversions, but Vibe, who I'm running them with, they basically can see the IP addresses that they're sending in the, you know, which houses they're sending it to, and to some degree they can track who's sitting your site. And it's been interesting because the thing, what I've read is that it takes a while for it to pay off. Like you generally won't see conversions in the first three to four weeks even. But what we've seen is that our cost per session on site, it's like five x lower now than it was when we started.
Eric Nowoslawski: So it's definitely running a little while.
Ivan LaBianca: Yeah. And part of that's just because it's a 30 day attribution window, I think. But it is interesting. We're definitely getting people on site from it. Unfortunately, being self-serve, we don't get that many conversations with people. And so it's just a really small sample size. I keep asking reminding the sales guys, like ask where they heard about us and they don't always remember to. People don't always know, but like the day that somebody's like, oh, I saw you on TV.
Eric Nowoslawski: Yes, finally. Yeah. Like I said, I mean, like one, I mean, I'm wearing the brand right now, but like when Noble Pro, like Noble Projects started as like a luxury CrossFit brand. And like, I know for a fact that's how they started because the two guys left Reebok and then they knew how to run the CrossFit Playbooks.
Ivan LaBianca: Then they did that.
Eric Nowoslawski: So I was a Noble customer. But the day they ran, I saw their first TV ad, I was like, wow, this company is like, they made it big time, right? And so if I were to, I think anybody who's running TV ads, it's like, in my opinion, it's people haven't caught on. I think we're in this window right now where people haven't caught on that it's like, what are you spending $100 a day or something?
Ivan LaBianca: Like the budget is $500 a day. I'm running it really heavily in Texas. I kind of was like, where can I get the right frequency with $500 a day? And it's basically we're doing, I'm trying two different targeting tactics, but mostly in Texas. Yeah. Yeah.
Eric Nowoslawski: And so, I was like, well, if.
Ivan LaBianca: We get an uptick in Texas, we know, right?
Eric Nowoslawski: People think, in my opinion, that, okay, you're on my TV, you're a gigantic company. Like, there's no way you could afford a TV ad. Like, anyone can run a Facebook ad, and I think people are used to that. But I think there's some alpha right now, in my opinion, on these TV ads. I've even wanted to reach out to the Vibe people and be like, can we do cold email for you? Because I just think it's so interesting. But yeah, I'm so interested in all that.
Ivan LaBianca: Yeah, you should. They're cool. I think that their company's grown really fast. Yeah, you should reach out to them. I think they're actually European, weirdly. Do American Connected, but I think they might be like, I think the founders maybe Finnish or something like that.
Eric Nowoslawski: Okay, very nice.
Ivan LaBianca: Yeah. Cool. Well, we'll talk about it if you have anything else. Otherwise, we're good on our end. Personal emails, what'd you find?
Gabe Emerson: Between five and eight credits per row, depending on how far down the waterfall they get, because we're doing cheapest to most expensive. So Eric, I know on the last call you mentioned how much per play credit we charge. So whatever that is.
Eric Nowoslawski: Oh, it was like 1.8 cents or something. Whatever our charge is. I always forget what it is because now they're raising it and I'm in negotiations with them. Pretty sure it's like 1.5 or 1.8. Just do 1.5. 1.5 for him.
Gabe Emerson: Okay.
Ivan LaBianca: 1.5. So, okay, so we'd be between. So it's actually not that much cheaper than doing and mobile, huh?
Gabe Emerson: Mobile was like for the entire workflow, it was about 15 credits per.
Ivan LaBianca: Okay, so it's like 30.
Gabe Emerson: So it's about half. Yeah. Because then we have to verify the number and stuff.
Ivan LaBianca: Okay. Yes, the mobile is quite a bit more. So if we wanted to run, if I'm doing the math right, if we wanted to run, a 10,000 rows, we'd be looking at like 700 to 1200 bucks, something like that. Is that right? Am I doing my math right? Um, yeah.
Gabe Emerson: Yeah, I'm looking at 12, like about 1200 between 700 and 1200.
Ivan LaBianca: Okay, cool. Let me, let me. I'll get back to you via slack on that, but might want to have you pull and test that and see what the match rate looks like.
Gabe Emerson: Sounds good. Cool.
Ivan LaBianca: All right, very nice.
Gabe Emerson: All right, talk soon. See you guys.
Ivan LaBianca: Bye.
