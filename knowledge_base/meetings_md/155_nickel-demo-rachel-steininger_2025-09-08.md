Jacob Greenberg: Hey Rachel, can you hear me? Oh, I can't hear you.
Rachel Steininger: There we go. Sorry, it was my mic. It always turns off when I unplug my laptop.
Jacob Greenberg: No worries. I'm just getting my my setup going here. How's your day going so far?
Rachel Steininger: Good. You know, it was like a typical Monday morning, like between 8 and 8:15, I walked the dog to Starbucks and by the time I got back, I had like five emails from clients, so, you know, it's good. People invite me over the weekend, I guess, so.
Jacob Greenberg: Nice. Where are you located?
Rachel Steininger: I am in Chicago.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, cool.
Rachel Steininger: Yeah, like actual city. Nice. Yeah, where are you at?
Jacob Greenberg: I'm in Brooklyn.
Rachel Steininger: Oh, nice. Okay. That's great. Are you from there originally or are you a transplant?
Jacob Greenberg: I am from here originally.
Rachel Steininger: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: More and more transplants every day.
Rachel Steininger: Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: How about you? Are you from Chicago?
Rachel Steininger: Not originally, but I've been here for 25 years.
Jacob Greenberg: So long time.
Rachel Steininger: Yeah. My son, though, is. He's at Iowa State right now. He's a freshman, and he's in, like, such culture shock being out in the middle of, like, Farm Country and with all these kids who grew up in the middle of, like, you know, on Farms, so. He's like, Mom, I think they're really impressed with all these buses around campus.
Jacob Greenberg: That's really funny.
Rachel Steininger: Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: All right, cool. We have, I have 30 minutes here for us on my calendar. Is that okay with you still?
Rachel Steininger: Yeah, perfect.
Jacob Greenberg: Awesome. Cool. So usually typically we start off with, you know, the purpose of the call is just to align a little bit more, have me understand what you're looking for and how you found us to begin with.
Rachel Steininger: Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: After I know that, I could customize a demo more towards what you might be looking for. And I could open up like a demo environment and show you what it looks like and walk you through that. Does that sound okay?
Rachel Steininger: Yeah, that sounds great. So I'll give you a little background. I, in part, this is for my own business, but I also work as a fractional COO and invoicing is a question for every single one of my clients because they're all in some kind of professional services function, so they, have timesheets sometimes from contractors, sometimes from employees. They are merging those in usually with some kind of markup to then bill back to their clients. And so whether it's an AP issue, an AR issue, or trying to match those two together, just trying to always look at like what are good solutions for those clients. And sometimes it's better for them to go into like a project management system and have it all built together. And sometimes it's just we need to fix one part of the process and Yeah, I will say most of my clients prefer to bill by ACH. If they're not billing by ACH, they'll opt in client by client to a credit card, but sometimes passing back that fee.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, gotcha. Can you tell me a little bit more about upward acceleration? Is that your, that's the company?
Rachel Steininger: That's my firm. Yeah, so I work as a fractional COO and a So think of it like management consulting, mostly with small to midsize firms. I do some coaching and advisory work still. That's what my business started out doing. But mostly I work with those business owners who sometimes are the visionary, but sometimes they're just that accountant or lawyer or whoever, and they just wanna get back to their work and not mess with the business stuff. So I do it for them either myself or contracting out to other people, but getting it A lot of it has to do with technology.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. So I know you said you're looking at consolidating ARAP, keeping it a little more organized for some of your customers or some of the clients that you work with. Is there a specific tool that you're most commonly using at Upward itself or that you're recommending to the people that you're working with?
Rachel Steininger: No, and that's why I kind of framed it as it's mine too. I mean, I think most of my clients are They're on QuickBooks and they're using QuickBooks to do their invoicing, but it's very clunky, especially when it comes to and again, I know your solution is very niche compared to some of the things that I look at. But, you know, some of the common complaints are just the inflexibility of the invoices, the, you know, the fees aren't necessarily as good as you might get elsewhere with payment processing. It's hard to pass back hard to pass back credit card fees. You have to manually enter it a lot of times. The invoice doesn't look very good. It's hard to keep track of retainers, hard to keep track of outstanding balances, things like that.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha.
Rachel Steininger: Yeah. And at the moment, a lot of my clients actually work with other. Their clients are also professional service firms, a lot of lawyers, and so they're pretty used to those. The end client is pretty used to getting an invoice in, sending it through a whole department, cutting a check or sending a wire or sending an ECH. But wanting to have that online payment link just so it's easier on the business itself.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. Okay, cool.
Rachel Steininger: I would say all of those are true for my business too. So I'm just not at the volume that some of my clients are.
Jacob Greenberg: So you guys are also using QuickBooks then?
Rachel Steininger: I'm not, but my all my clients are. Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay.
Rachel Steininger: Here.
Jacob Greenberg: I'm sorry, Rachel. Well, give me one second. There's a. I'm gonna close my window in the back of my house. There's a car honking outside that I can't.
Rachel Steininger: Fine.
Jacob Greenberg: All right, I'm sorry about that.
Rachel Steininger: That's okay.
Jacob Greenberg: All right, cool. Yeah, I'll walk you through, Nicole, I'll show you a little bit about how it looks. So I know that you said, let's break this out for one second. So specifically for you at Upward versus your customers that you're working with.
Rachel Steininger: Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: Walk me through a little bit more about the ARAP process. You said you're not using QuickBooks. So when you're sending out and receiving payments, how are you tracking that? Are they mostly ACH? Are they mostly credit card? I know that it's hard to manage the credit card fee.
Rachel Steininger: Like what's the breakdown of these? Yeah. So for me, it's pretty simple. I just keep track of my time in Clockify. I then take the total each month for each project that I'm working on. I drop it as a line item into Stripe directly. So I'm generating that invoice in Stripe. And I'm turning off the credit card function. So they're just getting like ACH and wire bank transfer type options.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha.
Rachel Steininger: So that's how I'm typically doing it. What's not ideal there is I can't do recurring transactions in Stripe unless it goes through a credit card. So I have to use an outside service.
Jacob Greenberg: Do you do a lot of transactions?
Rachel Steininger: I don't do a lot. I did more in the past, but I am changing my pricing model from just straight hours to more of like a hybrid between hours and a monthly retainer. So using points to judge what the deliverables are. A lot of reasons why I'm doing that, but that'll mean that somebody's paying a base rate each month and then we throw up once a quarter. So having some recurring plus the ability to jump in and add an ad hoc fee would be okay. Helpful for me.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. And I interrupted you. You were talking about some of the features that Stripe is lacking right now.
Rachel Steininger: So you're, yeah, it's really just the recurring and then.
Jacob Greenberg: Their.
Rachel Steininger: ACH fee is great. It's $5. So no big deal on that. My invoices tend to be somewhere between, let's say, $5,000 and $15,000 per invoice. And so, Sometimes less than that, but a lot of them are kind of sitting right in that area. But the recurring will only allow you to do credit card.
Jacob Greenberg: And how often are you invoicing?
Rachel Steininger: Invoicing fee is at 0.5%, which is per invoice, which when I was not doing too much was fine because it really stacked up against the subscription fee was probably about the same, but now it's getting to a point where it's It's like, well, if there's an all-in-one system that does this for me at least, that's great.
Jacob Greenberg: So that invoice fee is that 0.5% for ACH per transaction?
Rachel Steininger: It's actually on top of the processing fees. So. If I were to set up a recurring invoice or it was through like a payment platform, like I've set it up on Thrive Card, let's say, There would be no extra fee, but because I'm going in and using the invoice functionality in Stripe, they charge an extra 0.5%.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay.
Rachel Steininger: Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. So it's the $5, the fee for ACH plus the 0.5%.
Rachel Steininger: Yes.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. And is that uncapped? Like if you're doing a 10% or $10,000 transaction like you said you would.
Rachel Steininger: Do, that's yeah, it's uncapped. So you can see that if like I'm in an invoicing software that's 40 bucks a month, like pretty quickly it doesn't take too many transactions for me to get that. Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: How many transactions are you doing on a monthly basis? Is it just a handful of clients or?
Rachel Steininger: Between between like four and 10, it varies.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay.
Rachel Steininger: Yeah. Right now I bill out on the hourly ones, I bill out twice a month. So.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. Now for the clients that you're working with and solutions that you're recommending to them. So I know that they're also having issues with AR and AP consolidating everything, but most of them do use QuickBooks. Is there a typical payment process that you're seeing across your client base? Is there a specific tour they're using? Are they using Stripe the same way you're using it? What are you seeing?
Rachel Steininger: No, I'm different than my clients. So most of my clients are I'm actually walking through with one of them in an hour, but he's a private investigator. He has a number of contractors. So let's say he needs a surveillance job in Brooklyn, right? He will find a contractor in Brooklyn who can go and do the surveillance job. And usually the jobs are about two weeks long. So he's continuously like getting a request, sending out a proposal, contracting with somebody, getting the vendor bill back, and then having to We wait for his bookkeeper to manually extract that information. There's so many ways that he could be improving this. Extract that and then put it into an invoice, adjust it to the client at a different rate than what the contractor just charged, and send it out to the client. So it's all right now, every single step in his process is manual.
Jacob Greenberg: Now, I guess my question would be for your clients, do you manage any of this process for them, or are they just coming to you asking like, hey, how can, how can we do this better? Like, do you hop in there? Do you help them with invoice generation and like managing the QuickBooks?
Rachel Steininger: I usually hand it back to an office manager and an admin at the end. Like, I'll walk through it. I have another client who we ended up going with BQE system. And yeah, we've gone through that together the last couple times, but it's She'll be fine, I think, going forward.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, cool. So I'm going to show you two unique demo environments, one that would just be for your environment, but I actually think that we, and I'll give you some background about Nickel, but after we got launched, we specifically started for contracting and construction, the built world industries, because they're very check heavy. Our founder came from Stanley Black & Decker and thought we could do this a little bit better.
Rachel Steininger: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: Cash flow is terrible in those industries too. So the entire point of Nickel was really just to improve cash flow for these businesses. And then we ended up just creating a easier way to do AR and AP.
Rachel Steininger: However.
Jacob Greenberg: The first audience, the first user base that came to us after developing specifically for contractors that wasn't contractors was accounting firms and accountants. So we created a solution that.
Rachel Steininger: It.
Jacob Greenberg: Is no extra charge. It's just depending on your use case, we'll toggle this feature on or off for your account. But there's a clients tab that we can enable so you'll have like a parent account and under your parent account, there'll be individual accounts you'll be able to access if you're going to be doing things like consulting for their AE in the audio. Transcribe the English words that are spoken. So it might be something you'd be interested in checking out. I'll walk you through that. But so I have a little bit of background for Upward. I know one use case for one of your clients, a private investigator, is what is like the, is that the company that you work with who you think would like needs this type of solution the most? Is there one type of business that comes to mind? It's all of them.
Rachel Steininger: The other one that I just that we just put on DQE, they're a forensic accounting firm. What's similar about these two is that they both have end clients that are law firms who then have end clients. So there's multiple layers. Okay. I work with a lot of law firms directly. The rest are all like professional services. So it's consultants, it's marketing agencies. So very similar where it's delivering some kind of professional service. There's a mix of employees and contractors. I'm then either billing out to an end client or an intermediary to the end client, like the law firm for, you know, let's say the divorce client, something like that.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. All right, cool. Let me just pop open my time.
Rachel Steininger: Frames and different like packaging, but the base needs are very similar.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. Okay, let me open this up. Can you see my screen here?
Rachel Steininger: Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: Awesome. Okay, cool. So this is going to be, this is a demo account that we have. So there's some information filled in here and I'll walk you through a little bit, but Nickel is very, very straightforward and basic. It's, the whole point of this was to make something that's ridiculously hyper simple to use for teams and for the people who are making those payments. So for the clients of users, because we've just found that right now, people either have one specific payment type for you guys, for example, you've narrowed it down to AE because you didn't want to spend any money with credit card and there wasn't an easy solution. Or people are still using all the available payment types, but across like three or four different platforms, and they each have a different process to settle. So we wanted just to make it as hyper easy as possible to have all the different payment methods centralized in one location. This would be your summary tab here. This is really just an overview. Once you have some more data, you'll see summary of all the transactions you process within NiCle or within QuickBooks. I'm going to actually bring us down to integrations real quick. On the settings page, there's a lot of integrations we can do, but QuickBooks is the most common. We're going to pop in here and just do a QuickBooks integration. This is a two-way sync with QuickBooks. Depending on the amount of data that your clients have, it might take 30 seconds to three minutes for the first time for it to connect. Afterwards, it's an automatic two-way sync. Whatever invoice is generated from within QuickBooks will populate within Nickel. And whenever it's paid from Nickel, it'll be passed back into QuickBooks. So there's no need for any interruption.
Rachel Steininger: In the current process that you guys.
Jacob Greenberg: Have other than sending and receiving via Nickel. Okay. Just wanted to point out off the bat here on the transaction tabs, this is kind of an overview of all your transactions, an easier way to manage them and visualize them. So you'll be able to see all of your transactions, the status of them, whether they're completed or processing, what bank it's going to or from.
Rachel Steininger: And.
Jacob Greenberg: Some people use Nickel put purposes, especially service-based businesses instead of memos or invoice numbers. Some businesses do invoice numbers, so that would be here under the purpose. Easily filter for receivables and payables or for any customer that you work with, any date of transaction or size very quickly. Now to get to creating these invoices, the first thing I want to show you is actually this payment portal here. So, Nickel's fantastic at creating individual invoices that you could send out to clients. Also have this generic payment portal where some of our older customers, like Chicago Brass is probably one of our earliest users. And they have a pay invoice button here at the bottom of the page.
Rachel Steininger: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: And it's essentially a general generic invoice button. You can come and make any payment via the website, but this is customizable so you can enter any amount of fields that you want. You could require people to upload images or sign contracts. So this could be a multi-step process that your clients can embed on their website if people are making general payments or if they need to respond to an invoice number. However, most people do use Nickel just to send out one on one individual invoices. So I will walk you through that as well.
Rachel Steininger: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: Now, when creating an invoice, it will either auto populate in Nickel if you created it in QuickBooks prior. I know that you guys at Upward aren't using QuickBooks, so I'll walk you through creating one in here instead of having to create one in Stripe. You'll see off the bat that you can choose a recurring or new invoice, so one off. And I'm going to make a test customer here, so I'll do Rachel Test. And I'm going to put my email address so that I could show you what it looks like for a customer to receive an invoice request. Now, when you send out your invoices, are you typically doing invoice numbers or purposes?
Rachel Steininger: An invoice number.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. So I'll do a little invoice number here. Now, there are two different platforms with Nickel. One is core and one is plus. Core is completely free to get going free to use. Both have unlimited free ACH, regardless on if you're on core or on plus. You're going to not have to pay that 0.5% plus $5 per transaction, which I think for you would be roughly, I have a little calculator I plugged it into.
Rachel Steininger: Like 25, 30 bucks a month.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, I had it coming out more actually to like 3,000 a year or something. We could get into that.
Rachel Steininger: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, I had 275 a month. I guess I did $5,000 transactions. I'm 10.
Rachel Steininger: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: Here, let me show my screen again up here. All right. But yeah, regardless of the cost, you won't incur it.
Rachel Steininger: And then if the invoice needs more information, like here were the number of hours, it really needs to come through QuickBooks in order to have that detail on it.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, so if you do sync to QuickBooks, this page actually looks a little bit different. The visuals you'll be able to see in QuickBooks, all the fields you can update on an invoice in QuickBooks will be editable from this page as well. So you can create it from QuickBooks, send it over to Nickel, and then send it out from Nickel, make any edits you want to in reviewing it from Nickel, or you could literally just sync QuickBooks and then start to build them and send them in Nickel as well. It'll capture all the information that you previously captured in QuickBooks and it'll send.
Rachel Steininger: That back to QuickBooks as well for you. If you have like a dozen time entries, let's say for in QuickBooks that are going to get pulled into an.
Jacob Greenberg: Invoice, is that that will all get pulled over that level of detail?
Rachel Steininger: Yeah. Okay. Yeah. And then are you able to show me an example of what that would look like? And it's okay if it's like a past example? Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: I think it might be easier for me to send you like a screenshot or recorded video later today, I need to get a QuickBooks Sync demo account with actual QuickBooks Sync in there.
Rachel Steininger: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: But I can show you what this looks like to go out.
Rachel Steininger: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: But essentially what you can, I'll show it to you so that I don't have to make you imagine it, but right here under the invoice details, it'll just have different line items that you can add and all the different features that existing QuickBooks will show. In this area here. Now, you can make this a one-time or recurring payment. I know you're interested in doing some recurring. So if you did recurring, you just select that type, choose the cadence, whether it's weekly, quarterly, monthly, or annually. And when it starts and ends, and you'll see a payment schedule here.
Rachel Steininger: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: And this will just automatically go out. So there's two different ways you could charge a customer. One is you can request their payment information upfront. And Nicole has a very clean and well-organized management of uploading that information. So I'll show you what that looks like as well. It's very, very simple to do. It's like a three-step process. And once it's uploaded, we're responsible for PCI compliance and SOC 2 compliance, so you don't need to manage your customers' private financial information or sensitive data. And you can auto charge from within Nickel once they give you the approval to do so. Alternatively, you could send out individual invoices like this recurring one or a one-time payment, and they would just enter their card information each time they were going to check out, and it will just settle on your account.
Rachel Steininger: Okay, so I either have to get the information up front or they have to check out every single month. Yeah. Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: So another cool thing here is that you can upload any documents. I always have a hard time finding the one document I want to upload. It hides for me on my laptop. But you can upload any amount of documents here on the transaction level. So if you do have contracts with customers or if there's photos of services that they want to show, it's all embedded on the individual transaction. One big difference with Nickel and other payment processors, I'm not sure this is the same with Stripe or maybe some tools that your clients might use, but larger transaction sizes with Nickel all bless you. Larger transaction sizes with Nickel all have a one-to-one settlement. So it doesn't matter how large of the transaction is going to settle one time in your bank. Whereas if people are using QuickBooks Pay, for example, they have a $25,000 payment. It might come into their bank as $5,000 transactions upon settlement. So just for bookkeeping's sake, it's a little bit cleaner and easier. And on the advanced tab here, you can enable or disable credit card payments.
Rachel Steininger: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: Allow customers to edit the payment amount of the transaction itself. So that means they have a $50,000 transaction. I have a customer that wants to pay $25,000 in credit card and $25,000 in ACH. They're able to customize that on their end. So pretty much just giving the most optionality to your, to your clients clients as possible.
Rachel Steininger: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: And if you do, so this is mostly for like some larger manufacturers and distributors that have custom agreements. Sometimes they have contracts with, hey, when we do pay credit card, we're going to share the rate.
Rachel Steininger: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: So you can customize the rate split. However, with nickel, for the most part, everybody keeps credit cards on as an option and they put 100% of the card on the customer. And the reason why is I'll show you in one second. The customer is going to see this link here and they'll be presented with an option to pay via credit card or to pay with no fees. And they'll very clearly see, okay, this incurs a 3% fee, this occurs no fees. So as a user of Nickel, you're offering your clients whichever payment method they prefer.
Rachel Steininger: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: And it's pretty clear. So more industrial businesses, we see like 17% of the time they're paying in credit card. Anyway, even if it's a larger transaction and they're paying a larger fee, because they have a lot of people have 3% cash back cards anyway, it's just a better cash flow advantage. But you can put the start and end date. So this is a recurring one that will be paid on the eighth of every month on a monthly cadence. But if you did a one time transaction, you could do net terms on that transaction. So you could just set the date to end on, in 30 days or in 45 days. And then from, I'm going to send this link to my email also, so you see what that looks like. And then from here we'll be able to see, is this still an active invoice? How much has been paid, if any? And should I send a reminder?
Rachel Steininger: Okay. So the reminders are manual. Yeah. Which is fine. I've had clients who, their clients have gotten upset because they got it on Christmas or something.
Jacob Greenberg: Got it. On the recurring ones, you could set this so that these are going to go out when the bill is due every month.
Rachel Steininger: Got it.
Jacob Greenberg: And send reminders manually if you would like. But yeah, besides that, it's a manual payment.
Rachel Steininger: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: So yep, and then come into what I'm sure is going to be an unorganized email, my email inbox, not this email itself. And so the invoice number will be Your company name plus the memo purpose or invoice number that you put, that'd be the subject of the email. You'll have a logo and your company name here. Then you just go to pay now and this window will populate. Very clean and easy. If there's any previous transactions between this business and their client, it will actually show right here. They could hop into all their previous invoices. And this page can be edited and updated whenever needed.
Rachel Steininger: Okay. Yeah. Yeah. If I could get screenshots of how this looks when it's synced up with QuickBooks, that would be great. Oh, that looks like it is synced with QuickBooks.
Jacob Greenberg: So these are, I don't think I have access to the QuickBooks. Let's see. So we have some demo data on the build pay side. What I want to have to show you is some on the AR side when creating the invoice a little bit more in depth because these don't look like they have any custom unique information that like line item stuff.
Rachel Steininger: When bills come in, how does that process work? That's also the AP side of it of just tracking payments out to vendors.
Jacob Greenberg: When bills come in, how does that process work?
Rachel Steininger: Yeah, so like the bill pay side of it.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, so it's the same way you could set up for recurring bills.
Rachel Steininger: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: So if you do have rent or any contractors that you're paying on a monthly basis, you're doing payroll for people, you could do recurring bills here. You'll be able to see a list of all of your active recurring bills as well.
Rachel Steininger: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: Pop into that really quickly. However, for.
Rachel Steininger: A.
Jacob Greenberg: Step or two. So I'll add you as a vendor. Either this is going to be imported from QuickBooks or you could do it manually. So you can either enter the vendor information or have them fill it out. So this is actually going to be a good example of getting their information. I'll show you what that looks like too. But let me choose another vendor for now that I already have in here. I'll set a payment amount, a reason for payment, and a due date. And I can upload any documents I want for that bill pay as well.
Rachel Steininger: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: Go to make a payment. Or I could save and close and wait for that due date. I'll choose a credit card or bank. And I could choose a delivery method, whether I want to do a CH or a check. We'll send checks for you as well, but it has a two dollar delivery fee. Associated. And then you just set it up. So right now I need to find the AE information for the person I'm paying, and then I could send that invoice or send that bill. But when I'm requesting vendor information, so they fill out their AE information in advance, it'll come like this. We'll give a little description of what is Nickel, why we're requesting some banking information and information. So am I a contractor or an individual? Upload your bank info, connect with Plaid to review, and then once the Plaid is connected, you just go to review and submit.
Rachel Steininger: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: And all that vendor information, so whether this is for ARAP is stored automatically and compliantly. And then you can just go ahead and process that payment directly to that company.
Rachel Steininger: All right. Is there room for saving like the, what is the W9 or anything like that on here?
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, in the document section for the uploads on each individual transaction is a great place to do it.
Rachel Steininger: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: So if you would like to, we do have this like notes section here to mark as flagged or reconciled and you can add your own tabs here. Just for keeping track of stuff. But really the best way to do it is to click into the transaction and on the transaction detail, when you have created this transaction with files on it, you'll be able to upload those documents.
Rachel Steininger: Got it. Okay. Yeah. All right.
Jacob Greenberg: Cool. I would love to walk through a little bit more. I know this feels a little bit rushed today. I feel like you have a couple different use cases going on, but If you have any questions, I'm happy to answer them. I'm also happy to set up another 15-20 minutes for later today or later this week if you think it'd be helpful.
Rachel Steininger: Yeah, let me run this by my, I'm going to talk to my client in a half an hour, the one that has the most pressing need. But yeah, this has been great to see how it works. If you can send me a screenshot of what it looks like with time entries flowing through from QuickBooks, that would be great.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, got it. I will do that.
Rachel Steininger: Okay. Thank you. Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: Let me know. Keep me in the loop after you present it to them. You can feel free to, you know, it's free to get so if you want to just create a free account and play around in it and you have any specific questions as you go, I feel like I gave you a really high level overview, but if you have any specific questions, I'd love to help you approach them.
Rachel Steininger: Are there real quick question? Are there other API or integrations? Like if I wanted to connect something to Zapier or trigger off a workflow somewhere else? Abilities to do that. Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: So on a case by case basis, we review these. Essentially, we don't have apis other than QuickBooks because if you look up, like, AE with payment processors for stripe, for example, stripes only, like, data breach was via API with third-party software. So right now what we do is we do AI agentic connections and web hooks, which we find is just a more secure way and an easier way to build out. Yeah, just something method, but it's on a case by case basis, like solution that you're using or company that's using it. We could build web Circleback really quickly. It just depends on the use case. So is there one customer and if.
Rachel Steininger: It'S synced to QuickBooks, then I imagine things can pass through. Let's say they wanted to use the invoicing functionality, but they're going to still use Bill.com and PayVendors through Gusto, their payroll provider. Obviously being able to trigger something in QuickBooks, I can also use the... Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: That'S the other thing a lot of people that come to us with API requests and have QuickBooks. Already have QuickBooks integrated into something and QuickBooks is like their source of truth for accounting. So as long as Nickel is connected.
Rachel Steininger: With QuickBooks, all of their systems are going to operate in sync with each other. And that's really, that's where the crux for this client is, is what is that baseline system going to be for them? And if obviously QuickBooks for accounting, but.
Jacob Greenberg: Is it QuickBooks for client management? And is it, I think that's what we're, what are they, what is their.
Rachel Steininger: Current process for ARAP? Is this the, Asana, QuickBooks, spreadsheet, Google Sheets.
Jacob Greenberg: Oh man.
Rachel Steininger: Gusto, a bookkeeper doing manual entry, PDFs coming in, time sheets being kept somewhere else. Like it's just all over the place. So yeah. And they're looking at everything from like an ERP type system to so what, what I would just make my invoices look prettier.
Jacob Greenberg: How many, how many transactions are they doing monthly? Is it like a really, really high volume or is it low volume and.
Rachel Steininger: Yeah, they're a new client. I don't. I think it's pretty high. I think. I'm gonna say it's like. I'm gonna guess they go through. Through 50-ish cases a month, something like that.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay. Yeah, that's not too bad.
Rachel Steininger: I. Volume. They're not that big of a business, but it's. Yeah, it's quite a bit. Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: I mean, I think that I've just seen this a lot in construction and contracting as well as, like, people very. Often when there's big problems to solve, they look for bigger software and they're like, oh, we need a bigger company with bigger software to help solve this because we have a huge process problem. And so they go for ERP systems, which are very expensive and take a long time to implement. And then you're bound to the process that the ERP subscribes you. It makes you a little bit less nimble. It's a heavier lift and it kind of entrenches the workflow that's not working.
Rachel Steininger: A little bit more instead of lightening it. So I don't disagree having just moved somebody onto a, an like onto core BQE's core. It's taken months. Like it's taken months and it's come down to like there were just a couple little detailed things they couldn't budge on and nothing else was going to. Well, it's like the right solution, but like, oh my gosh, that's costly. Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: If you ever want to get, we have customer success teams here. And if you want to get me and one of them on the call with one of your clients to help figure out what the best workflow is, we could do that as well. We could do with just you at a later point, but it seems like for that workflow, it's just invoicing, like literally reducing the amount of solutions from all this to QuickBooks plus nickel.
Rachel Steininger: Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: Could be a solve for them. I would just make sure to generate all of the line items for payroll and for keeping track of those different payments that they're doing in different tools in QuickBooks alone. It's consolidating QuickBooks or just having a PDF and plugging it into nickel. If it is payroll and if it is recurring payments, that'll be really easy. It's just the one time setup and then management after that. But yeah, I mean, Nickel is great because it's a lightweight solution to get implemented quickly. And if it's working, it's working. And if you need to tweak and iterate upon it, you tweak and iterate upon it. But yeah, it'll definitely save money if you're going out to spot by other solutions to fill gaps in the process.
Rachel Steininger: Yeah, and that migration issue is yeah, just it's huge. So, okay.
Jacob Greenberg: Well, all right. I would love to check in and see how everything's going in the week or so. Is that okay with you, Rachel?
Rachel Steininger: Yeah, that sounds great. Thank you.
Jacob Greenberg: Awesome. I'll throw some time on for.
Rachel Steininger: We'Ll.
Jacob Greenberg: Do a 10 a.m. next Monday. Is that all right?
Rachel Steininger: Yeah, just double check.
Jacob Greenberg: I can do a little here as well, if you prefer.
Rachel Steininger: Is that 10:00 a.m. Eastern or 10:00 a.m. Eastern?
Jacob Greenberg: 10:00 a.m. Eastern, yeah.
Rachel Steininger: Yeah, that should work. Can you do, actually, can you do 11:00 a.m. Eastern or... Yeah, of course. I can do 11:00 a.m. Eastern.
Jacob Greenberg: That would be better. Okay, awesome. I'll send this invite out right now. And good luck connecting with some of your clients. I hope you have the opportunity to hop in and test it out on your own for Upwork.
Rachel Steininger: Okay, thanks. Appreciate it.
Jacob Greenberg: All right, have a good rest of your day.
Rachel Steininger: You too. Bye.
