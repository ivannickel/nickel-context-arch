Jacob Greenberg: David, can you hear me? Hey, guys.
Bridget Curtis: Can you hear me?
Jacob Greenberg: Okay.
David Curtis: Hey, can you hear me?
Jacob Greenberg: Hey. Yeah, I can hear you. Can you hear me, guys? Testing, testing.
David Curtis: Bear with me. I can't hear anything.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, no problem. Testing, testing.
David Curtis: I've got a new setup and I'm trying to figure out how to make it all work.
Jacob Greenberg: No problem. Take your time. Can you hear me now? Can you hear me now? Custom.
David Curtis: I still can't hear anything. I don't know what the deal is. Bear with me.
Jacob Greenberg: No problem.
David Curtis: I just had to relocate, like, my whole office and everything, and I just got it set up today, so.
Jacob Greenberg: Nice.
David Curtis: I'm trying to make it all work.
Jacob Greenberg: 14. Can you hear me?
David Curtis: Oh, there we go. Yes.
Jacob Greenberg: Oh, nice. Well, congrats on the new office space. I hope it's an upgrade.
David Curtis: It's actually a home office, so I got kicked out of my office at work. Trying to make room for everybody at work, but yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: Nice, nice. Well, I'm happy to help play a role in getting your home office set up correctly.
David Curtis: I am expecting Bridget. I just texted her to see if she was still going. Going to join because she did accept it. And so perfect on that.
Jacob Greenberg: And then remind me, Bridget does, like, most of the financial stuff for regrouping.
David Curtis: Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: Dave, can you still hear me? Okay.
David Curtis: Yeah, I can hear you. I'm just my. I've got a camera, my monitor, and I'm trying not to use my laptop. Use the monitor.
Jacob Greenberg: Got it.
David Curtis: Just the camera's not connecting for some reason.
Jacob Greenberg: I don't know. Yep. No need to see me. As long as you can hear me. How's everything going on your end?
David Curtis: Going pretty good. Very busy. Just trying to bounce between the two different companies and then two different companies and then trying to get everything lined up for the. For both or for the new one, you know, the Metal Roof Supply. But I feel like this is something that both companies will benefit from, so I wanted her part of it. All right.
Jacob Greenberg: The other company is new. You guys are starting that, right?
David Curtis: Yeah, yeah, yeah. The. The new company is Metal Roof Supply. I'll just talk in this direction. It's aggravating me out. I can't get it out. New companies, Metal Roof Supply, and our parent company is Residential Investment Group, or Rig Roofing.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha.
David Curtis: And so that we've been in business for 20 years in Central Florida, and so we're venturing off to do something a little bit more vertical with our roofing industry, and that's to make our manufacturer roof panels. Yeah, manufacture all the roof panels and all the components that go with that and, and use it as a separate company altogether. So I feel like it's to some degree this, this will help in both aspects, but really primarily for rig the roofing portion.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. What? Do you guys have a website for the new company yet?
David Curtis: Yeah, It's. It's not 100 up and running. There's actually. It's basically kind of like a landing page at the moment, but it's metalroofsupply.com.
Jacob Greenberg: Nice. It's awesome that that domain was available for you.
David Curtis: Yeah. Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: Cool. Yeah. Well, I mean, I'm happy to talk today because I know that based on the conversation we had last time, it seems like Nickel is going to be a pretty easy implementation for rig roofing at least. And then when you get that one with supply, you'll be able to put that into action. And I know that you guys are currently paying at least 1.5% processing fee or having to pass that along and deal with it. So I know that this could save you guys a lot of time and money. I'm excited to kind of see what the implementation might look like for rig roofing before you get into rolling everything out. Yeah, across my orders and supply as well.
David Curtis: Well, I'm sorry, she hasn't responded my text or anything yet and she. It's on her calendar for today and she did accept it, so I'm not really sure.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, that's all right. And if you can't attend today, and we definitely want to keep her in the loop as we move forward and make this decision, I'm happy to set up another call. But, you know, from my understanding is that really we just want to talk systems integrations more so than anything else. Like, as far as financial components of this, it's going to be a net save off the bat. So I don't think that's going to be a long or hard conversation. It's going to be pretty quick. Most of it's about just walking you guys through, hey, this is how you get set up. This is how you would operate, this is what you would integrate for your use case and then setting like a roadmap together when you expect to do what so I can make sure you guys are supported on your onboarding for some initial transactions and stuff like that.
David Curtis: I'm sorry, I know that I went through this whole demo and I was just kind of hoping that she would be available to get the whole gist of it too.
Jacob Greenberg: Well, I am a little booked up this week. If we have to Reschedule. But I do have a good chunk of time the first half of next week, so, I mean.
David Curtis: And that would be okay, too, because I know that she's leaving tomorrow for Virginia, so that would probably be. I'll probably be okay, too, if we have to. I'm just still waiting on her. I probably. Let me give her a call.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, no problem. Hey.
David Curtis: Just touching base about our zoom call at 2 for nickel. It's about Nickel. Sent you some of the details on it a couple weeks ago when I was in Idaho. Are you. Do we need to reschedule? Okay. All right. She can.
Jacob Greenberg: That's.
David Curtis: Yeah. Okay. All right. See, she's jumping real awesome.
Jacob Greenberg: Hey, Bridget.
Bridget Curtis: Hey. Sorry I'm late.
Jacob Greenberg: It's all good. I'm happy we can make some time with the next today. All right, can everyone hear me okay before I hop into it?
Bridget Curtis: Yep.
Jacob Greenberg: Awesome. All right, cool. So I have about 47 minutes left for our call today. It probably won't take that much time, but does that work for you? Yes. Awesome. Perfect. All right, cool. So, Bridget, I'll catch you up a little bit about what Nickel does. In the previous conversations that David and I met a couple weeks ago and we spoke about nickel for written roofing. I understand that you guys are at an exciting moment where you're looking at starting another company for the roofing supply, but specifically for rig roofing. We had a quick conversation about how you guys are currently processing accounts receivable and even. And also doing accounts payable and identified that there's some solutions here using Nickel to reduce the fees you guys are currently paying, save you guys more money, and just make it a little easier and seamless with your accounting system and save time. But definitely want to get a quick recap before I hop into it. I did a whole demo with David last time we met, and I think that the purpose for today is to walk you through that and make sure you're caught up to speed and give your insights on the platform as well. Make sure that it's accommodating everything you guys are doing on the financial side. Does that sound fair?
Bridget Curtis: Sure.
Jacob Greenberg: Cool. All right, so walk me through one more. Just a quick recap, a little bit about your AR and AP process. I understand you guys are using affilinks. Is that correct? For your ERP.
Bridget Curtis: But accounting, we use QuickBooks.
Jacob Greenberg: You guys are on QuickBooks online, not desktop.
Bridget Curtis: No, it's desktop.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. Okay. Gotcha. Cool. And then, so the process is you guys are kind of creating the line item quotes in the erp, the work that needs to be done. Some of it on a high level. I understand. David, you said not everything's getting pushed over to the desktop version of QuickBooks, but then invoices go into QuickBooks, and you're sending out invoices from QuickBooks Desktop. Is that correct?
Bridget Curtis: The invoices go out through AcculinX. Okay. So when you create it, it'll flow automatically over to QuickBooks for the accounting, and that's where you'll post your payments and that kind of thing, and then that information flows back to AcculinX.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. So you're sending out the invoices from AcculinX, and it's getting posted back into QuickBooks Desktop. And then when you guys accept these payments, you're going to. You'll be accepting both credit card and ACA payments through these invoices, Correct?
Bridget Curtis: Correct.
Jacob Greenberg: And then what is the percentage of fees that you guys are taking for ACH and for credit card? I know that David said you guys are applying a 1.5. You guys are eating some of the fees for every transaction and passing some of the fees on. You're sharing it with the customer. You walk me through that a little bit.
Bridget Curtis: Well, I'm not really sure. Off the top of my head. I know that our credit card fee is right around 2.8% for what's going on on credit card. I'd have to look at what my ACH payment and what those kind of fees look like.
David Curtis: I kind of spelled out to him that for our. Not our credit card specifically, but our financing options that we give our customers. We don't charge a financing fee. We don't. We. We kind of put that along the lines of everybody shares the fee, and we have it just as a percentage in our thing. So that was the only thing that I really knew for certain are those numbers or how we do that is. Is if we offer financing and how we get paid for those financing options is it's kind of across the board. Everybody gets charged a certain percentage and nobody gets a fee specifically.
Bridget Curtis: Right? Correct. And it's the same way with our credit card fee. They're all built in to every price. So all the fees for any financing or credit card payments or ACH payments, they're already built in to every estimate.
Jacob Greenberg: So you're applying the same fee to both the credit card and the ACH for the invoice. So, like every invoice, you're attaching a certain percentage fee to it for the customer to pay. Or is it different on credit Card. Is it different on acu?
Bridget Curtis: No, it's. It's the same across the board. Every job gets the same fee.
Jacob Greenberg: And that. What. Do you know what that fee is? 1.5%.
Bridget Curtis: No, I. I don't know off the top of my head. Built into my template. So there's a formula where we built it.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, cool. And just give me one quick recap. I'll hop into the demo in a second here. On a given month for accounts receivable at least, how much money are you guys processing in a given month via, you know, aca? It's your credit card. Mathy links.
Bridget Curtis: Well, I don't know if our, if our goal is $1.5 million a month, that's how much is rolling through here. So in some form or another, you know, I don't know the percentages, how much is paid by direct check versus how much is paid by those other financing things. I don't, I don't have that information broken down like that.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay. So I'm just. Sorry, Just taking some notes real quick. Do you find these guys are primarily doing credit card or is it a pre. Even split between ACH, credit card and check?
Bridget Curtis: No, it's all pretty evenly split. I don't know of any skewing in one way or the other.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay. All right, awesome. So I'm going to pop in. I'm going to show you a little bit about Nickel here. I'll give you some background about our company as before I do, but. So Nickel was started by our founder who was leading the innovation department, Stanley, Black and Decker. And it was initially built for the built world industries, so contracting and construction, because he noticed that in the companies that he was working with. So I had a big cash flow issue. Money took a long time to deposit into the account. It was expensive to be able to receive it. They were accepting credit cards, checks, ACH and a bunch of different methods. So his idea was just to be able to make it incredibly easy to accept whatever type of payment. Built World contractors want their customers to be able to pay them in without it affecting the timelines or their bottom line. So Nickel, one of our core tenants is we offer completely free ACA and we offer the ability for customers to pay via ACH or credit card however they choose, customize that invoice as well. But if they elect to pay credit card, that fee is most of the time passed on to the customer. You could customize the fees that you could split it with the customer if you want to do a flat rate of like 1.5%. But it is mostly used so that businesses in the contracting and built world don't have to incur any type of fees whatsoever anymore. So for you guys, if you're doing 1.5 million a month, that's the target. You know, 3% of that is a pretty high amount. So I'm gonna show you the platform here. We do work with a lot of QuickBooks desktops users. I was under the impression you guys were using online. Do you guys have a plan to move towards online? I know QuickBooks has been kind of pushing people in that direction recently.
Bridget Curtis: Oh yeah, yeah, it will happen. I just don't know when.
Jacob Greenberg: The One thing with QuickBooks is that it seems like they just keep increasing fees for desktop users as a way to incentivize people to get onto online. And I've heard a lot of frustrations from companies I've been working with in that regard. But regardless, the reason I even bring it up is we do have a direct integration with QuickBooks Online. So if you do decide to make that transition to QuickBooks Online, you can import all of your information directly into Nickel. And it's a one to one instantaneous API. So whatever happens within Nickel will automatically get pushed back. Excuse me, into QuickBooks. If you are using QuickBooks Desktop, essentially our QuickBooks Desktop users will use Nickel Export CSVs on a daily, weekly, monthly basis, import it into QuickBooks Desktop and that will update their ERP user to CRMs as well. So people use Nickel as essentially the cash flow of their business where you can generate invoices or do bill pay as well, and non current keys during the process. It also creates a slightly better branded experience for the customer and I'll walk you through what that looks like. First things to note here is you'll be able to see on the left hand navigation four different tabs. First is a summary of just your recent transactions. This is an overview of all of your transactions. So if you do import with QuickBooks, all that will populate here. If you don't, it'll just be the things that started after you started using Nickel. You'll be able to see all your receivables, all of your payables, where the money is going to and coming from, the purpose and the status of those transactions. Also very easily able to go in and reconcile any transaction if you want to manually update it or flag it. Put any notes for invoicing. You're going to live in the get paid tab here and I'll show you how to create an Invoice. But I'm just going to show you this Easter egg really quickly. Before we pop into generating invoices, some of our customers will embed a payments link on the website. This is just not a unique invoice. It's more of an open generic payments link. But you can customize these fields to be whatever you want. You can have people upload photos if you want to, or put different test fields. And it's just a way for people to make payments directly to your website. I'm not sure if this would be interesting to you guys or not, but I just set up these guys recently with the same thing. So they embedded a payments tab on their website here and they'll be able to, you know, customize with their logo and their branding, accept payments directly from this portal. When generating a new invoice, do you guys ever do recurring invoices or is it mostly. It's mostly one off with the deposit up front and a balance after the fact.
Bridget Curtis: Yeah, there's no recurring gotcha.
Jacob Greenberg: So you go ahead and create a new invoice to create an account for you guys here as an example.
Bridget Curtis: Customer.
Jacob Greenberg: Put my email address in here so I can show you what the invoice looks like when it gets sent. And now the cool thing with nickel is that we are built on newer payment rails, we call them industrial strength payments. So we're able to send and receive transactions of an unlimited amount. You guys can do $400,000 $500,000 transactions in a single transaction and it has a one to one settlement with your bank. So it will take the same amount of time to go through two to three days for ach, one or two days for credit card. You'll set it as a one time invoice or. Or one time. Yeah, one time invoice with the date and the due date as well. So if you guys do net terms you would set that date here. You can include any notes for customers here and attach any of the, you know, sample invoices, that line item invoices that you have the more detailed ones coming out of your CRM or any other documents. If you wanted to put photos of the job site, want to put net terms, agreements, anything to coordinate that communication with your customer. You could do it in the single portal that you're going to share with them.
Bridget Curtis: So being since I create my invoices and Accu Links does this link to Accu Links and it flows to these invoices or whatever. Are we expecting double entry or what?
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, so it's a Good question. We. With QuickBooks Online, if you do have like a CRM connected to QuickBooks Online, this will connect to QuickBooks Online as well. So QuickBooks Online will become your source. Whatever you do within AcculinX would then push to QuickBooks and then would automatically populate here in Nickel. We don't have an integration directly with QuickBooks Desktop at the moment. So if you guys wanted to begin using this While you have QuickBooks Desktop before moving to online, you would either be creating the invoices from the CRM that you guys have in acculinx or DRP and then attaching those details to the outbound invoice in Nickel and creating a new one in Nickel just so that you can process that transaction with no fees and a little bit faster. It is an extra step to save a little bit of money and to provide slightly better customer experience. And what you can do is really think of Nickel as the cash flow in and out of your business and then you have your ERP and your accounting system when you guys do make a migration. QuickBooks Online, we're going to be able to sync everything into one system very easily and it's going to save a tremendous amount of time as well. I'll show you some of the features that are built around that as well. But it is an extra step if we don't have QuickBooks desktop integration now. We have built custom integrations for companies before. It's not an out of the box thing though. So it would be a conversation about what the value would be for you guys, how what you're telling me for wanting a tool like this. I would talk to my internal team and see how long it would take to build out something like that. But yeah, just to be transparent with you, we do mostly work with people integrating through QuickBooks online at the moment.
Bridget Curtis: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah. And that's kind of why I was curious if you guys had a plan to transition to online, and I was under the impression you guys were currently there.
Bridget Curtis: Yeah, we're probably a year out.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. Okay. I think in that case it would be one more step for the invoices that you're processing. I know that you guys do a pretty substantial volume of invoices in a given month. I also know that you guys do a pretty substantial volume of just money moved. So I think at the very least, I'll show you the rest of the demo. It won't take much longer, maybe 10 minutes. I'll answer any questions you guys have and if it makes sense based on the amount of money you would save. You guys can implement it, I can give you best practices, and you guys can sign up today for free. It's a test drive. We have two plans. One's a free platform and one is $35 a month. So it's very easy to get going. But, you know, if you guys are doing, I mean, you are removing 50% of your trans. That can't be right. You're doing a million 1.5amonth, and half of that's credit card. You guys are paying at least $22,000 monthly on fees, probably another 1% at least for the other 50%.
Bridget Curtis: So now I will say I misspoke a little earlier when we were talking about the fees, because the credit card fee, when they do opt to pay by credit card, we add 3% to whatever amount they're paying. So that is passed on at the time of the payment. It's kind of a pain in the butt, to be honest. You know, it's just. It's one more thing to keep up with. But when we talk to the customers, we literally say, hey, you could pay by check, cash, credit card. However, if you're paying by credit card, there is a credit card fee. And so we do pass that on to the customer. That's not. That part's not built in. It's the ACH fees. Any domestic wire, which to us is the same thing, and then any finance fees is what's baked in.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. On ACH fees on like the conservative estimate, you guys are probably paying at least 7, 500amonth on ACH alone. That's like a 1% ACHV, which is pretty standard for ERP systems. I'm not certain what you guys are doing. That's just an estimate on my end. So if it's something worth looking into, saving at least that 7, 7, 500amonth could be useful. I'll show you real quick what it looks like to send out this link. And maybe, you know, the process would be in all transparency, if you're creating the invoice within this accurate CRP and then moving into nickel afterwards to generate again. It is an extra step, but it might save you some time on the accounting front. So I'll just walk you through this real quick. Just created the invoice here. Just one second. If you do have customer information, and this might be interesting, you could charge that customer automatically and we do debit or credit withdrawal from their account, so via ach. So we have a really sleek way to onboard new customers. If you Guys do want to onboard new customers at the beginning, have them fill out a form, give you the authorization to be able to withdraw a deposit and withdraw the remaining balance. You could schedule that in advance and do it automatically. Otherwise you can send out the individual invoice to either their email or their phone. Show you what that email looks like. And the and the invoice look like this. The Grod distribution is the name of our demo account. So this would say rig roofing. This would be your logo and your icon and your branding. It'll link that to your website if you click on it. Awesome high level information regarding your account. So the amount for the invoice, if you had any documents attached to this, like line item invoice or net terms agreements, photos of the site, it'll be attached to this email. It'll also be attached to the invoice when you click Pay Now. And it's pretty straightforward, gives them the option to pay by card or the option to pay by bank. You'll see no fees associated with the $10,000 transaction if they pay by bank and a 2.99% fee if they do elect to pay by card. This 2.99% fee, we handle all of that. We'll automatically attach it, we remove it before it's distributed back into your bank account. So you guys don't need to worry about that. Except for accounting. It also gives them the ability to edit and customize the payment amount. So if they do want to pay, you know, just the deposit and then you have one living invoice for them to pay the balance at the end, they could do that as well. Or if they wanted to pay the balance half in credit card, half in ACH because it gives them a bit of a cash flow advantage, they have the ability to do that also. So that's a little bit more customizability and features for your customer. If they've had previous transactions with you as well, those will populate below this you'll be charged line. So they'll be able to see all their previous invoices with you directly from this unique portal. And it's just a branded experience. Once they do pay, it'll move from an active invoice here into a completed invoice and it'll be marked as paid. You'll be able to see the amount that was invoiced and the amount that was ultimately paid. So if they paid half of it, you'll be able to see that they still have a half remaining if they just paid deposit and the balance is withstanding. You can still request payment from them or send a reminder really quick. I have a couple more features that might be cool, but just wanted to get your thoughts real quickly before I move forward and take up more time.
Bridget Curtis: Well, currently ACCU Links, it kind of does what you're doing here. There is a payment feature inside accu links called AccuPay, and it has that where you send your invoice and it links it to it right when someone pays. Like if I were to send a link through Nickel and then they make a payment, where is it posted to.
Jacob Greenberg: Once they actually make that payment?
Bridget Curtis: Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: Yep. So you'll be able to track the paid invoices from here and it will settle directly in your bank account if you have QuickBooks connected. It'll also anything that transaction through a nickel will be visible in QuickBooks. So I know that's like a year out to do that.
Bridget Curtis: Okay, so the payment will post to QuickBooks.
Jacob Greenberg: When you say post, what do you. What do you mean?
Bridget Curtis: That means if I had an invoice for $500 that I initiated through Nickel, and then they go in and they make their payment, that payment information, whether it be ACH or credit card or whatever, automatically posts to that invoice that customer applying it to that invoice.
Jacob Greenberg: So it would post within nickel. If you do have QuickBooks synced, it will post within QuickBooks as well. If you do have QuickBooks sync. And QuickBooks is also synced with Appulinx, it'll sync with both Nickel QuickBooks and accuracy right away.
Bridget Curtis: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: So the key thing there is that QuickBooks information. Now, one other thing is on the transactions tab is where you kind of track everything that's happened, all of your cash flow within nifl, it's really easy to sort and filter. So you can do it by date. If you want a daily report, you can just filter for daily reports or weekly or monthly. And you can export this as a CSV and it's importable directly into QuickBooks as well. If you want to do that for reconciliation purposes. Is I'm not sure if you would import anything ever in Acumix. But in the meantime, before you guys transition over to QuickBooks Online, you'd be able to download the transaction report, import it into QuickBooks Desktop or whatever cadence, like a weekly or monthly cadence that you think makes the most sense to do that. Keep the books up to date.
Bridget Curtis: Okay. So when they make their credit card payment, did you say, like if it's a 3, $10,000 payment, and then you're adding those fees on top of it. And so you submit to them that, hey, you need to pay 10,299 if you're paying by credit card. So by the time it gets to me, you have, you will take your fees off of that. And the only thing coming to me in my bank is the settled amount of $10,000.
Jacob Greenberg: Precisely. That's correct.
Bridget Curtis: Okay, that's actually kind of good. We have trouble with all of our stuff matching now because we have to add those fees ourselves. And so what is that?
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, what does that look like for you guys, like, when you have to add those fees yourselves? What's the reconciliation process when you're trying to do bookkeeping afterwards?
Bridget Curtis: Oh, yeah, you have to find it. You gotta hunt and find it. You literally have to use their website and match up every transaction. Like, you can see the original amount. Right. And then the adjusted amount. And so, yeah, it's one of the places of heartburn regarding this.
Jacob Greenberg: And when you're doing that, is this something that, Bridget, you're. You're taking on the responsibility solo or the other people on the finance team that are also digging through these. How much time has it taken you typically?
Bridget Curtis: Yeah, no, we have an accounting team of about four or five people. So we're all working on it in some way or another. There's not one direct person.
Jacob Greenberg: That takes up a substantial amount of time. All right, Yeah, I mean, so this is the platform. We also have a bill pay feature. I'm happy to walk you through, but it sounds like for you guys, to be honest, it might be one extra step. You'd be creating the invoices, downloading the individual line item in PDF. If you want to attach it into an invoice that goes out through nickel, creating the account in nickel. Good news is when you do create an invoice in nickel, it's really, really easy because it's only the cash flow information. You're just attaching the invoice to it. So you're just selecting the customer, putting the amount and the date it's due, pressing send. Once it's done, you'll be able to download the CSV and do the import. So that's the second extra step that's going to be involved in your process. If you don't have a direct integration, the upside of this is you're going to be saving all the time you're currently spending doing that. You know, the 2 or 3% that you guys are manually adding on need to reconcile on your accounting system. It'll also potentially be saving you guys, estimating probably $7,500 a month. And maybe. So if that time save and that money save is worth the one to two extra steps per invoice, I think this could be a good solution for now. If you think that nickel is a good solution, but those extra steps are going to be prohibitive for you wanting to use it. What I would suggest we do is I talk to my team internally and see if we can build out an indicator integration for you guys with Accu links or with QuickBooks Desktop. It wouldn't be an overnight thing like nickel. Right now. If you guys wanted to go in and test it out after this call, you could sign up for free. Free an invoice. You could test a transaction. It takes five seconds. But if you wanted to do the integration, it would be a little bit of a longer process. I talked to my team and see what it would scope out what that project would look like and come back to you guys. So with that information, what's your temperature check? Is it like 1 out of 10? Do you think this is something that could be useful for you immediately, or do you think that it would be a pain in the butt?
Bridget Curtis: Yeah, no, I'm, I'm really not interested until I'm on QuickBooks online. It really is not helpful, you know, because you talk about save time, but then I got to do extra steps. So does it save time? And honestly, I think the funding that you're thinking, as far as how much it costs, cost, it might be a little high because I. I don't know the percentage of my breakdown of payments. Just think I still have a lot of people that pay me by check. And then obviously there's credit card and then there's this. So, you know, I want to dive in and see exactly what that is costing me because I don't know off the top of my head to even know the amount of savings that I would be talking. So, yeah, I just don't feel like this is viable with QuickBooks Desktop, you.
Jacob Greenberg: Know, so if we did have a QuickBooks Desktop integration, just remind us I could, because I, I do hear this often. A lot of people are moving off QuickBooks desktops, but a lot of people are still on it. And so I'm constantly pushing on my development team to make sure we have something to accommodate that. If we had a QuickBooks desktop integration, is it something that you'd be ready to use?
Bridget Curtis: No, not immediately. Accu Links makes it too easy. Seriously, they have, and it's Honestly, a feature that we just started using the last four months. Like, I would have to see something major. That's why as soon as we hang up, I'm gonna try to pull a report and see how much I'm paying in. What's really exciting about your program has nothing to do with the credit card because like I said, I passed that fee on to my homeowner. But the ACH fees, how much does that truly cost me? But that's the nice feature about nickel is I could get ach payments for $0, you know, in costing. And that's something that, you know, I've baked into every estimate, so savings is good. I just. I don't. I don't know that that's where it's at right now. You know, that the new feature that we just. Before that we didn't accept ACH payments, you had to mail me a check, or you could come in and pay a check or whatever you wanted to do. So I feel like I probably just need to dive in and see what those expenses are to be able to weigh this out. But at the moment, things are working well, and it just sounds like I've got to increase workload in order to use your product.
Jacob Greenberg: Are you guys using. And that makes total sense, Brigid. I'm happy that we're aligned on that. There's one other thing that I'll show you to put in the back pocket on the AR side, but for your accounts payable. Are you guys using aculinks as well to make those payments?
Bridget Curtis: No, sir. That's QuickBooks.
Jacob Greenberg: You guys are expensive.
Bridget Curtis: The expenses do flow down to every job in Accu Links, meaning it'll post as a job expense. I. I don't do any payments. It just lets me see my job profitability in my CRM. So all my payments and credit cards. And credit card transactions, you know, like, we have a big company credit card. Everybody here has a card, and we have to reconcile it every month. Everybody turns in their receipts and stuff. So all bills, vendor bills, and credit card receipts run through QuickBooks.
Jacob Greenberg: And when you're making your payments, are you doing ACH or credit card primarily for the payments? Is there one method?
Bridget Curtis: No, no, we still send a check in a mail. They're prominent vendors. The ones that we have like hundreds of invoices every month. They have an online portal, and so obviously we go straight to that. So the other people, the one offs, you know, and obviously our credit card, that's a login, and you make that payment. But, you know, the Smaller subcontractors and people like that, we're just writing them checks.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. Are you writing checks to those smaller subcontractors because it's just the way that you guys have always done it, or do you have an initiative to want to move that to be digital?
Bridget Curtis: Well, my subcontract, they're kind of small, so I mean, I just gotta be sure that they're prepared to do it. You know, a lot of them want to take that check too, A check cashing store, and just go get their cash. You know, depends on how they run their business. So yeah, it probably is an opportunity for improvement because by the time I print a check, put it in an envelope, put a stamp on it, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, that is a pain. But nonetheless, our larger accounts are managed online.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. So on the bill pay side, that's kind of what we're built for. To make all that really easy, we do send checks on your behalf. If you wanted to continue to do checks, it's $2 per check to send it from nickel. Otherwise, most people use this for ACH to transfer off of having to do checks makes it a little bit easier for them to track everything and to not spend all that time on all the checks that they're sending out. Again, it's free ACH if you wanted to do it for your nickel. So it's a bit of a money saver from other platforms for bill pay instead of doing bill pay for ace directly through QuickBooks or something like that. And then this also might be something that's easier to import into QuickBooks than, you know, your accounts receivable at this time. But it's a good option to have in your back pocket. You put different approvals in here, so if you do have people on your accounting team, you can give them all access to mix. I'll schedule payments for the future and if you wanted to, you can approve them and have that control in order to approve them. And it just makes making the payments a lot easier. And it's also free ACH to do so.
Bridget Curtis: Okay, cool.
Jacob Greenberg: Well, it sounds like we need an integration to make this time saving, but also sounds like you. At the very least, I spurred some curiosity into what you guys.
Bridget Curtis: Yeah, yeah. No, you make me want to dive in because I feel like I need to know what those are. I like the idea, you know, when it comes to ACH payment, the faster I get my money the better. So it's worth whatever pennies I have to pay. But you know, got to see how that's impacting your bottom line too.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah. And you know, the whole concept of Nickelodeon from the get go is to be a cash flow company. Like to make it so that you guys are getting your payments quicker and they're getting out quicker. Just have stronger cash flow as a business. In the future, we do hope to add other products like trade credit, stuff like that. So if you guys do make the transition to QuickBooks Online and you start to go through that process, I'd love to be a resource for you being in the loop. Bridget, if you do some investigation to find out how much you're being charged for ach, feel free to let me know. I still understand that we're going to want to figure out an integration so we don't need to set a follow up meeting, but if I can be so bold as to assign both myself and you guys a little bit of homework and we can touch base in an email would be. I'll talk to my team internally and see what it would take for us to build out an integration for ACCU links or for QuickBooks Desktop for your use case. Don't want to guarantee anything or promise something, but it might be nice just to have that information so we can share it together. And if you do your investigation and you find out that you guys are paying substantially more, substantially less than you thought in ach, it'd be helpful for me to know as well. Does that sound okay? All right, cool. All right, well, I am disappointed that we're not going to be able to kick this off today and walk you through signup, but I'm happy that we met and I hope that over the next year we might actually be able to work together and save some money and save people time as well.
Bridget Curtis: All right, thank you for your time, Jake.
David Curtis: Appreciate it, man.
Jacob Greenberg: Thank you, Bridget.
Bridget Curtis: All right, bye, y'. All.
David Curtis: All right, see you.
