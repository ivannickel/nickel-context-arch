Colton O'Farrell: Hey, Mark.
Mr. Hull: One second. I gotta change my speaker, apparently.
Colton O'Farrell: No worries.
Mr. Hull: Well, that should work.
Colton O'Farrell: Can you hear me okay?
Mr. Hull: Can you hear me? Good.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah. Can you hear me okay?
Mr. Hull: Ah, there we go. There we go. How are you?
Colton O'Farrell: I'm doing well, Mark. How about yourself? It's great to meet you.
Mr. Hull: Nice to meet you too.
Colton O'Farrell: You have a good weekend?
Mr. Hull: Yeah, you know, I had a, I had hip surgery, like. Oh, no. Well, yeah, five weeks ago, it was fine. But I must have overdone it. I was fine, then I think I overdid it.
Colton O'Farrell: Now a little sore from the weekend?
Mr. Hull: Yeah. So where do you want to start?
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah. So, Mark, I did some looking into your website. Obviously saw the feedback that you had had about wanting an affordable ACH customer kind of payment solution. So we, of course, can provide that. I saw that you guys, I was looking into kind of admissions, tuition costs. I saw that you guys are utilizing Zephyr for kind of fundraising. Just was curious to learn a little bit more about what's not on your website, understanding what you have in place today for your kind of systems and processes, and then also really what brought you to Nickel, how you found out about us, and what exactly you're looking to do would be a great start, starting point.
Mr. Hull: Sure.
Colton O'Farrell: So.
Mr. Hull: So back in, I'll just give you a little background. So Co when covet hit, my wife is, she's been a teacher for, like, 35 years now, 36 years. I, I was from the tech industry, but was in between, in between jobs. And covet hit her school that she was working at went online, and then once it got to the point where I thought that kind of happened in January at the end of the year, the owner of the school, as a private school, decided to just not go continue business. So they ended their company. Long story short, we started our own.
Colton O'Farrell: Company.
Mr. Hull: Own school, and so it's kind of a homegrown school. So Cassie, my wife Cassie, she brings the education side to it. I bring the technology and business side to it, and it's kind of a happy marriage in that respect. So our systems, fairly homegrown.
Colton O'Farrell: I mean.
Mr. Hull: We don't have a lot of technology systems currently.
Colton O'Farrell: We have QuickBooks online or anything running?
Mr. Hull: I use QuickBooks. I use QuickBooks for bookkeeping, and then we have an account and stuff like that.
Colton O'Farrell: Is that the online version or is that desktop?
Mr. Hull: That you have the online. We're not online.
Colton O'Farrell: Cool. And then you also have an accountant that you're working with, too.
Mr. Hull: Yeah. And, you know, and then we have, you know, obviously we have banks and we have a bank and, and, you.
Colton O'Farrell: Know.
Mr. Hull: But we currently, we did have a, we do have ACH option.
Colton O'Farrell: Through your bank or is that through QuickBooks?
Mr. Hull: No, it's through a third party. So, so I don't know if you've probably heard of CardConnect, CardPoint.
Colton O'Farrell: CardPoint, yep.
Mr. Hull: So we were using them and that was great. And then they, I mean, it was, it did everything we want. Costs, the fees were low. Per transaction fee was less than, and I'll find out what you guys charge, but it was pretty low. And then they changed their platform and they went to Clover. Yep. So Clover was keeping the same pricing structure for us, but we don't want to, but for ACH, but their credit card pricing is, you know, per transaction is high. And our transactions are, we don't have a, like the volume we have is not, you know, we don't have thousands of transactions in a month. you know, we have 40 parents, you know, 40 families or 42 families. And so our transaction pool is probably around, you know, out of that, you know, it's probably 35 that we do per month, 36. So, but they're all like 18, 2000 per transaction.
Colton O'Farrell: So are the parents paying for that tuition on a monthly basis then?
Mr. Hull: Well, they have a choice.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah. What are the choices? I'm curious.
Mr. Hull: We have one payment per month. We have two payments, three payments, and then nine payments. So nine months of payments. So that's kind of, that's where.
Colton O'Farrell: So.
Mr. Hull: It'S not a ton. So we can't have like, we like if you were charging a percentage, and I don't know what your model is.
Colton O'Farrell: I'm happy to explain.
Mr. Hull: But if your model is based on the percentage of the amount paid, then that becomes like, so I'm caught because I can't tell the parents, hey, your tuition is X. But if you make an ACH payment, which we want you to do, that is going to be X plus that percentage. So I can't go, God, it's $2,000 a month, but because you're making a payment now it's $2,200 a month.
Colton O'Farrell: Right, well, I'm happy to, yeah, that makes perfect sense. And I just want to put kind of a little bit, provide some clarification. So just so you know, ACH with us is always free. So it's always free for you and for your customers. We have two plans available at Nickel. So I'm going to just quickly share my screen. I'll pull up the pricing plans just to kind of talk through those a little bit, make sure you have all your questions answered. But really, we have two pricing plans available with Nickel. Can you see these?
Mr. Hull: Yeah, I was looking at these. Cool.
Colton O'Farrell: So we have our Nickel Core and we have our Nickel Plus. I'll go through the core quickly. That is what every customer gets set up with when they first set up a Nickel account. So what that allows for, and this is for all of our customers, but free unlimited ACH. There are some limitations on the free account, those being that you can only have three active users on the account. You can only do $25,000 per ACH transaction. So that's not cumulative, meaning you could do a hundred of those. you just cannot do one at $26,000. We also give you access to a customer payment portal, which I'll show you. That's just provided to all of our customers free of charge. A lot of our customers will take that, customize it, and then embed it in their website, either to serve as like a backup method for parents, in your case, for parents to make payments. Otherwise, we have a native integration with QuickBooks where we can bring over everything from QuickBooks into Nickel. We can even turn on some automation to so your that it just automatically customers or the sends parents via text message or via SMS based on kind of all have to understand a little bit more about your business to see if Nickel Core or Nickel Plus would most meet the needs because there are some limitations, like I mentioned, with the Nickel Core. And those are being you can't schedule payments in advance. You cannot do recurring payments in advance. So it sounds like with the payment plans that you have set up for some of these parents, Nickel Plus may meet more of those needs. But just to kind of walk through that and explain the pricing there. So we have two options. You can either do monthly billing at $45 per month or if you do an annual plan, it's billed one time at $420, comes out to $35 a month. So we give you a 20% discount. There's no other fees associated with these plans. So we don't do transaction charges. There's no, like we're not taking a percentage from like an ACH invoice. The only way that you would pay anything additional to this is if on the accounts receivable side, you have parents that are paying via credit card and you have agreed to eat some of that credit card costs. By default, 100% of that chart, it's a 2.99% fee on the accounts receivable side. By default, that's set up to be paid for by your customer. But like I said, you have full control over that, so you could decide to split it 50/50, you could eat that entirely. Otherwise, the only other way you'd pay anything here is on the accounts payable side. is if you're paying bills with a credit card, if you're doing that, there's a 2.90% fee that would be paid for by you. But if you're paying bills with ACH, again, like I mentioned, there's no fees there. So on the Plus plan, we give you everything that you have on Nickel Core, but we basically remove a lot of the limitations. So you can have unlimited users, you can do transactions up to a million dollars per transaction, can schedule payments in advance, you can do recurring payments On the Nickel in advance, Core Plan, it's and generally then we two also to speed three up the ACH business days, processing time. as long So as you get it in before the cutoff times of 4:00 PM Eastern Time, the cutoff times with our sponsor bank. And on the Plus Plan, as long as you get it in before that deadline, you're generally seeing a same day to two day turnaround time there. But I'll pause. What specific questions do you have for the pricing there?
Mr. Hull: So we, well, so I mean, obviously from us, the 35, the Plus seems more, of what we would need. And that's fine. I don't know, my brain is just trying to process.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, no worry, it's a lot of it.
Mr. Hull: How is it that you guys can offer free ACH transactions when everybody else seems to be either doing a percentage or a flat rate? Like we have a flat rate, it's low. So, yeah, I mean, ultimately, I think Every month we're probably spending somewhere around like 200 a month. And that's a service, that's something that we're eating in terms of just to receive ACH payments in that convenience for our customers and for us. So 35 per month seems like a dream. I'm just like, how's that even, how are you?
Colton O'Farrell: Is it possible? Like, why are we doing this? Yeah, happy to explain a little bit more kind of our background history. So I'm not sure if you, you know, you've probably seen this in some of the, with some companies that you've worked with, but there were a number of companies who used to provide completely free ACH, those being QuickBooks, Bill.com, Melio, they provided this as a service for years to their customers. And then overnight, I believe it was QuickBooks, like QuickBooks who changed it first, but then they started charging a one to 2% fee on all this ACH transactions. Sometimes those were capped, sometimes they were not. I've heard kind of all over the spectrum of what people are paying. After QuickBooks did that, Melio followed suit, Bill.com followed suit. Pretty much everyone followed suit. Pissed off a lot of people. You can find countless Reddit forums or just like community forums of customers talking about how they went from paying nothing to paying hundreds or thousands of dollars a month. Our founders in 2022 had already started building like a payment solution for primarily kind of for construction wholesale. Some of these industries that have really low margins where cash flow is tight and they want to, you know, they're they can be a profitable business, but if they don't have good cash flow, they can, you know, go bankrupt. So they kind of saw that need had already started creating the solution. And then they realized the huge market opportunity by providing a service that is completely free of charge, that overwhelmingly will help small and middle sized businesses So we have over 10,000 customers who are using us today for accounts receivable, accounts payable, or both. We're a profitable company already. We have customers who aren't paying us anything, but even if they're not paying us anything, we have internal data that shows one out of five invoices from those customers is paid for with their customer via credit card. So even if they're not paying us anything, there's a good chance we're at least making something from some of their customers. That also gets a lot of positive reviews, referrals. We constantly are having referrals come in. I'm not sure if you're familiar with G2, I assume you are if you're from like kind of the tech world, but we have a lot. I'm happy to link our kind of G2 site and reviews on there, but we're really proud of the five point rating we have on there. You can also put us side by side, other kind of competitors and see how Nickel stacks up. But in short, we know if you provide something free of charge that is massive benefit to customers, they're going to love you, they're going to rave about you. We find ourselves constantly popping up kind of as even in like a chat GPT when customers are looking for better ACH solutions, Nickel's one of the first to come up. And that's because of all the chatter on like Reddit to community forums and just positive reviews on places like G2.
Mr. Hull: Well, that's kind of our methodology. That is where we actually found you guys.
Colton O'Farrell: Was it G2?
Mr. Hull: Chat GBT.
Colton O'Farrell: Oh, Chat GBT. Nice.
Mr. Hull: So my. Yeah, my wife.
Colton O'Farrell: She.
Mr. Hull: I was telling her about the trouble I was having with Clover because they're. I, you know, I mean, Clover, I think, is great for a specific, you know, or like a general population. We're kind of a niche kind of scenario where we just. We just use ACH payments. for customers to pay us. Yep, that's it. Like there's nothing, there's nothing, you know, there's we, you know, you know, we, you know, if, I mean that's kind of where we get our revenue. So that's, but we don't do a lot of outgoing ACH payments. Like we don't like our vendors, it's all over the place because, you know, like Comcast, we, I think we do credit card, debit card or credit card. And then we have, you know, so it's either our company card is paying for it or it may be a direct bank, you know, transfer. Some of that's through, like QuickBooks. I think that's a direct payment from our bank. And they also pay it due to our, our payments to the government and things like that.
Colton O'Farrell: So.
Mr. Hull: We don't, you know, we're just a small, like, you know, we have, like I said, we're very small. We've got around 40 to 45 students. We've got total like nine employees and we have several like helpers that come in and that are 1099 people and that's it. Like it's not a big operation.
Colton O'Farrell: So when did you and your wife take over after COVID? So I like you were saying earlier, there was the like the business, it kind of shut down your wife and you took control over that shortly after or was this like a separate idea of Noble Learning Academy came from?
Mr. Hull: Separate. This is fully like this is something from ground up. Like it's okay. It doesn't, you know, nothing. We didn't take over. We, you know, we would love to, but that would have cost, I mean, they were, they were, they were much bigger organization. You know, they had property and everything. So we, we're, we're much smaller. We've been, this is our sixth year and.
Colton O'Farrell: Business.
Mr. Hull: First year was all online. And since then, we have a, we have a, we have a place that we lease.
Colton O'Farrell: But have you been pretty consistent with the number of kids that you have? Is it, does that, like, change?
Mr. Hull: Yeah, it's increasing. Last year we had, you know, we have the classes sometimes fluctuate in size. So last year we had a large group graduate. So now we're have, you know, now our you know, trying to, if you have, you know, 15-20 students graduating, you know, that you got to bring in another 15-20 students. Yep. Sixth grade. So that, you know, we're actually getting close to hitting our number that we're, that matches last year. So it's close. But, you know, we've, every year once, you know, the school goes starts in early August for public schools and different schools and so, two or three weeks in, we get like three or four people come in. Yep. Because they're like, this is not working for us. And so they transfer in. So it's, it's, you know, it's a lot of work, but it's, you know, it's a great school. Kids are, you know, we're a non-profit woman-owned, you know, private middle school, so. I mean, we're really proud of it. And the kids come out. That's awesome. And so are like, you know, you saved my kid kind of thing. So it's, it's a, it's a lot. I mean, it's mostly my wife and her staff. Amazing. But, but, well, that's awesome to hear.
Colton O'Farrell: I was curious, aside from the tuition kind of pricing that you have listed on the website, are there other payments that the parents are generally making? Or is there anything from, like, a room and board perspective or. any field trip related things that they would like additional expenses or costs?
Mr. Hull: Sometimes there's a field trip costs that usually comes in the form of like a check.
Colton O'Farrell: Okay.
Mr. Hull: It's like a one off. They can make a ACH payment. You know, they have access to it. But generally speaking, my wife does all the field trip stuff. I'm usually more of like, here's tuition. you know, you have a bounce, you know, you know, if it's bounced for whatever reason, it's a typo for whatever reason, I've resolved this kind of issues.
Colton O'Farrell: So.
Mr. Hull: Hold on a second. Sorry.
Colton O'Farrell: So.
Mr. Hull: And in those are, they're not like the field trip ones are, are, they're not high cost at all. Like, you know, maybe it's 15 or ten dollars a student kind of thing. So it's not very big and then. We have a books and materials fee, which is that is due on like August 1st. And because of the issue we've had this year with our ACH payment platform, and it's actually been going on for.
Colton O'Farrell: Like.
Mr. Hull: Five months, six months, which we haven't been able to be I'm dealing with checks instead of ACH payments. I couldn't schedule it for everybody. But usually it's August 1st, that's our due date for our books and materials fee. That's per student. Perfect.
Colton O'Farrell: Well, that's very helpful information. I think I'm going to pop over to the demo and just start walking through some of the workflows we've talked about. Just want to show you what this will look like compared to the existing process you have in place today. So, Mark, what I'm doing right now is I'm just adding you as a customer to my, on my accounts receivable side. So I'm going to send you kind of an invoice just to show what the parents would see on their end. So all I had to do for that was simply add your customer name, your email. Do you do any kind of like payment or debit authorization where a parent has provided, you know, confirmation that they've agreed to pay this amount, you're able to just automatically pull from their account. Are you doing anything like that today? Yeah.
Mr. Hull: Okay. So we have a pretty extensive contract that we call our tuition payment plan, but it's a contract that states that we will be making payments or we will be setting up automatic payments, and it'll be pulled based off of whatever plan they choose. So that, that's a, you know. You know, you kind of have to have that, otherwise someone could just go, Hey, I'm leaving. You know, for sure. Payments, but that's kind of a lock-in. I was going to ask you, are you guys PCI compliant?
Colton O'Farrell: Yep, and we handle all the PCI compliance for credit cards. So you would only get the net amount, we would get the 2.99% fee that the customer pays, or if you went through and changed that global rule, at say 50/50 where you were splitting with the customer, we would always handle the PCI compliance. You just get that net amount.
Mr. Hull: Okay. And then do you do, do you have any daily, daily, weekly or caps like maximums or nothing like that? Okay. Any thresholds? Any thresholds we have to thresholds in terms of amounts or anything like that?
Colton O'Farrell: That you have to process to like be a customer?
Mr. Hull: Well, yeah, because during the summer months, we generally like all that kind of, all of our deposits and everything kind of go, they go away because everybody's completed their contract at the end or at the beginning of May.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep. So you may, I mean, you're more of a seasonal business, of course, right. With the school year and what that, no, I mean, we have tons of customers and various industries that are very seasonal businesses, and we just understand that that's kind of how they're going to work. All you really need to do to use the account, it's up to you to decide if you want to use it for Just accounts receivable, just accounts payable, or both. Once you have an account with Nickel, you really have access to everything that's within the platform. My role is to educate you on what exists, what makes the most sense for your use cases and your business, and really just guide you if you have any questions or concerns to just address those and just to really enable you to use the platform to the best of your unique use cases. So you don't have to worry about any thresholds or if there's seasonality to the business. We have many customers who have that exact same model. But what I'll show you, so we can actually accept the payment authorization forms that you already have existing today. One caveat with that is there is potential to slow down some of the payment processing just because our regulatory and compliance team needs to do the verification and double checking on their end just because with the day and age we. Live in. GPTs and AI, like people can create fraudulent ones. And of course, we have a process to make sure that we're only servicing good customers and for the use cases that we support. So you can utilize those. It could potentially slow down payments, but if you wanted to, we can also set that up. That is something that's a plus Nickel+ member feature. So you would have that with kind of the plan that you were talking about. But all you would do is add your customer name, their email address, you would hit this set up payment authorization form. So we're gonna do limited permissions. So you can set like a threshold and you can set when that expires. So just, and I'll delete this, like you as a customer and the invoice that I'll send once we're done here, but just to kind of show you how this works. So we'll set that just for a thousand, we'll have it go for the year. And I can just send a little note here. So I'll just say, hi Mark. please complete.
Mr. Hull: The form.
Colton O'Farrell: Thank you. So I'm going to send this to you. If you have like their information, you could enter it yourself. If you don't, we can send a form to the, to your parents or with customer to fill out. So I'm going to go ahead and send this over to you just so you can see what that looks like. But that would be setting, setting up for the payment authorization form. So you don't need to complete that, but if you want to just open it, kind of take a peek at what that looks like. But what I'm going to do next is I'm going to go to settings and show the QuickBooks Online integration. So like I mentioned before, we have a native integration. It's very easy to enable. You simply just go to account settings. You would go to integrations right here, click this green link QuickBooks account button. This would bring you to QuickBooks Intuit select page. your company, You'd chart sign of accounts. in with your And username once you do that, password. everything will be synced over to Nickel. So I don't have my demo account here connected to a QuickBooks account, but once you do, I do have a screenshot of what it would look like. You'd see something that looks like this. It would say Noble Learning Academy, your QuickBooks number, and there'd be this little, this toggleable option in the bottom here. What this would do is anytime an invoice is generated from QuickBooks, we could automatically automatically send it via to Nickel. your customer or One parent, reason we would do that is because again, we have no ECH fees, whereas QuickBooks has a 1 to 2% fee.
Mr. Hull: I'm sorry, can I just grab this?
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, yeah, of course. Sorry about that. No worries.
Mr. Hull: We have HVAC maintenance today at the house, and so I'm waiting for the guy to. It's supposed to be showing up stuff.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, well, hey, something to this is a that's kind of a great segue. So if that HVAC guy, I'm not sure what the payment process is like working with them. If you have, you know, send them like a check in the mail or if they have a pretty antiquated kind of payment system, I did want to call out this box here. So if you refer a business on a nickel, we'll give you a $250 incentive. So there's some terms right there, but all they would have to do is utilize your referral URL. But if that HVAC guy, if they have a pretty antiquated system, you think they might be able to benefit from this, you could talk about nickel, they could sign up with your link. We'd give you $250. And if you get two referrals to Nickel, that pays for an entire year's worth of Nickel Plus. So that's $420 annually. So two referral bonuses, we'd give you an additional 80 bucks. So a year of nickel free plus 80 bucks in your pocket. Just wanted But kind to of call back that to out, the QuickBooks but we do highlight that in the box integration. right there. So once you link that, everything is going to flow into an accounts payable perspective right here and an accounts receivable perspective right here. All of your invoices would flow in automatically here, and you would just simply go to this right-hand side where it says payment request and click this request payment. We would send this then either via email or via SMS text message to your customer. I'll go ahead and generate a new invoice. you don't have to generate them within Nickel. If you want to, you can. What you would do if you were generating them on the QuickBooks side, when you create the invoice, instead of going to review and send, you would simply click save invoice. That would automatically pull it into Nickel. And if you had that one field I showed you a moment ago, pull it right back up here. If you had this turned on here and you hit that save within QuickBooks, we would just automatically send that via Nickel. One caveat where it's you are having not to good go to in, have this make turned modifications, on is if once edits, you generate or an revisions, invoice, because each time you would do that, your customer would get an email for each of those changes you made. So if that's something you're doing, I would recommend just keeping this toggled off. Once that invoice is saved within QuickBooks, it just comes right in here into Nickel, and you simply go to the right-hand side and just send off that payment. But if you wanted to generate a new payment, I can show you what that would look like, and I will send So it we'll directly just to call you. this tuition and I'll just have it be for $100 here, one-time payment, or maybe I'll show you the recurring that might be more helpful to see. So you can set that up either to be every month, every week, every quarter, every year. I can put a note there. Hi, Mark.
Mr. Hull: Now, if it's scheduled, right? So if it's scheduled, I don't have to go in each time and do anything. It's just gonna pop up.
Colton O'Farrell: And if you have that authorization form, it's just gonna automatically pull from their account as well.
Mr. Hull: That's exactly what I'm looking for.
Colton O'Farrell: Perfect. Well, I don't have like a, like I'm just gonna attach a sample invoice just to show you that you can also attach invoices here. We'll also change the name of whatever attachment is with whatever's in this line right here. What I'm gonna go ahead and do, I'll also put this just as demo. you don't forget later in the future. But I'm gonna go ahead and hit create. What we're gonna do is we're gonna generate a secure payment link that's right here. It's gonna be sent to your email, just a moment here. So I'm gonna send that off. But if you were curious to see what it looked like prior to sending your customer, you can also just open that a new tab, copy and paste it in there. You'll get that email in just a moment. What you'll see is my name here, the email, You have the invoice you'd name have your or branded purpose, logo, that invoice attached right there. And then here's the two options the parent would receive. So they can either pay by card with that 2.99% fee. Again, we handle the PCI compliance, or they can pay with their bank where there's no fee. They just need to enter the routing and account number, hit pay, and that'd be completed. But if you have that payment authorization, we would just automatically be able to pull. They wouldn't even have to complete this step.
Mr. Hull: So let me go back to what.
Colton O'Farrell: We.
Mr. Hull: So let me go back to how we've done it, we did it in the past. Can you tell me how things vary? So what in our past system, the very first payment would be done by our customer. So they may go in, they would do an ACH transaction for- 4,500 bucks.
Colton O'Farrell: Or something for the deposit. Yeah.
Mr. Hull: And then they'd already signed our agreement, so we already have permission to set them up. I would go in, I would collect, you know, there's a button you click that they've consented and it would bring it in and say, okay, well now from that point, I can set them up as a customer. I can set up reoccurring payments. I can do a one-off payment. I could make any schedule for them that I wanted. After that, it was essentially it would do an automatic pull from their bank account each month. I would have to go in now. It was a little more complicated because it wasn't connected to QuickBooks. I would have to go in. I would get it, you know, because the way the, because each month, each day, let's say on the first, it would make a batch, a batch, a batch to my. Yeah, the bank. I get a total of 18, you know, thousand dollars or whatever it was or more than that. 50, $60,000, right? And then I would take that and then I would go back into their platform and I would go through and I would make it the entry for each person as a payment, each of our customers as a payment against their invoice.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep.
Mr. Hull: So, I mean, it was a little bit time consuming. It wasn't, you know, in the past, everybody would get a, in their folder, I would keep a record of it. like of what they make a payment. Like if I do checks, I scan the check, I, you know, log it into QuickBooks and then I save that check, copy that check in their folder, in each customer's folder. I don't know. I don't know if you're so... I don't think the folder parts a piece, but you're, you know, if it's integrated with QuickBooks, does it just automatically Populate.
Colton O'Farrell: It's going to pull all of your customers, your vendors from the AR, from the AP side. We'll pull everything that's in QuickBooks. So if you also have another system that you're using that feeds information into QuickBooks, as long as it's getting into QuickBooks, we have, like I mentioned, native integration. So it pulls everything in real time. We have a lot of control with that integration because it is native, like I mentioned. You don't have to be connected if you don't want to, but it sounds like it would Something be mostly else I in wanted your to benefit show to you do that so. I think might be of a lot of help, especially maybe from the field trip perspective, parents having to make one-off payments is, so if you go to the get paid section again, you can see that we have a payments portal link right here. So this payments portal is provided to all of our customers, even those on the Nickel Core plan. It is completely customizable. So what this serves really is for either backup payments or some of our customers do use it as a primary method. But this essentially serves as kind of a one-stop shop for a customer to come in and make any kind of payment for you. And they're again going to have completely free ACH with this method. Most of our customers will take this and embed it on their website. If you're a Plus member, we can also give you a custom URL or domain and you can actually go into settings and customize, you know, have your branded logo, the banner background in there. But your customer would either be able to pay via credit card, make any kind of amount, or they could pay via ACH and this for could free serve with their as bank. just mostly a backup method if you were preferring.
Mr. Hull: Okay, so the challenge I'm having today with my current system, if you go back to the payments page on the AC, no, I'm sorry, back to where it showed ACH and the payment options.
Colton O'Farrell: Okay, let's do that right here.
Mr. Hull: Not this. Yeah, you kind of have it here, but the other view that you had for like if I was going to host it on my website, Mmm.
Colton O'Farrell: So yeah, just like clicking on the, yeah, here, let's go back to the payment portal right here.
Mr. Hull: Uh, yeah, and then to make a payment, do a whatever one minute, and then go hit make a payment. Let's see, dollar, dollar, whatever test. Okay, here, just here. The challenge we're having today is even though I will tell my parents, I tell our parents, and I will say to them, look, Do not make a payment by credit card because there's a 2.99% fee on there. Don't do it because if you do, you're gonna be charged that 3%. I'm rounding up that 3%. They will do it anyway, even though they've agreed to the ACH payment thing. So what I'm trying to do is get rid of the payment paid by credit card, hide it, because I don't want them making payments that way. I just want them making payments by the pay by ACH. That's all I want. And that is a sticking point I'm having with Clover. They have an option to remove it, but it's not an option that a customer or my like my site can take remove it. I don't know how they do it, but they're not, I don't know, that's not something they want to do.
Colton O'Farrell: So what you can do, we can't disable credit cards globally because that is one of the ways that we make money as an organization. But what you can do is you can turn off the credit card option on a per individual invoice level. So you can disable credit card payments on like an individual invoice. You can also, so like I mentioned before, that credit card surcharge, so there's a 2.99% fee. You can actually, so by default, 100% of that is to be paid for by the customer. But some of our customers, they will split that 50/50. This is a global rule, so it will affect all of your invoices and customers. You could change it to be 25/75, you could fully eat the costs. But again, by default, 100% of that is to be paid for by the customer. You can also change the credit card rate. So in addition to disabling credit cards, you can also adjust that for a one-off invoice. So if you have an agreement with this parent where you're in split, the cost 50/50, you can just influence this one individual invoice and override that setting, but you wouldn't be able to mass disable credit cards just on an individual level.
Mr. Hull: So let's say I have 40 parents, right? And I have reoccurring payments. Are you saying that each invoice I can go in and disable it, or do I have to do it each transaction?
Colton O'Farrell: Since this one is a reoccurring, if you disable credit card payments on this one, it's going to influence all of the subsequent based on the cadence that you had scheduled. I know you mentioned that like the parents signed something, it says that they're going to pay via ACH. If the parent is paying the credit card fee and you're not having to deal with the PCI compliance, could I ask what if the kind of the main reason for wanting to have the credit cards disabled globally or yeah, I know.
Mr. Hull: It's a good question. The, the challenges, the challenges is, is that, and I don't mind if parents want to absorb that fee. I, like, I don't mind that at all.
Colton O'Farrell: That's, wait, I assume you're getting some kind of, like, pushback from parents. They're not, who aren't realizing that they have to make that payment or the, the fees and part of it.
Mr. Hull: Exactly. So, you know, you know, if you, if, if you They're just like they're just not, that's not looking like if like maybe they're okay with it the first time, but at the end of the year when they look at how much they've paid versus what I've, what our tuition cost is, they're gonna like, wait a minute, you've charged me 3% over that and I'm gonna go, well, it's right there black and white in front of you, but they're still gonna say something. So I don't want to eat a 3% off.
Colton O'Farrell: What I would say, this comes up all the time. I talk to customers who, you know, have this concern. There's a lot of, you know, there are people that, you know, they would be upset paying a three percent credit card fee. That's where you say, pay via ACH. Then all you have to do is add your, your routing, your account numbers completely for free. There are a lot of people that want to pay with the credit card because maybe they get a 45 day float. Maybe they're getting credit card points. you I know, would just you maybe can disable it on that level. But if you give the flexibility of having, you know, two different options, you know, there's parents who want to make that credit card payment. I would just maybe in your, in the language of what they're signing, specifically say, like, we offer completely free ACH payments. You can make those if you want, for whatever reason, to make a credit card payment that is also enabled. If you have parents that have a lot of pushback on it, you could just disable it for them. And I did want to say, unfortunately, this is about to kick us off the meeting.
