Belle Swartz: Hello?
Christian Sheerer: Hey, Belle. How's it going?
Belle Swartz: Oh, good. How are you, Christian?
Christian Sheerer: I'm doing well. I'm doing well.
Belle Swartz: Yeah. I think Carol's signing in. We had. I had to install zoom onto my computer, so it just took us extra minute or two.
Christian Sheerer: No worries. And, yeah, I mean, we can keep this pretty light, too. I know everything seems to be up.
Participant 1: And running, and when there are those little straggler questions, we can get to them by support pretty quickly. So.
Belle Swartz: Wait, hold on a second.
Participant 1: Kind of like hired other things or.
Belle Swartz: Hold on one second. Okay. Are you. I think. I think I might be having a hard time, like, hearing you.
Christian Sheerer: Can you hear me now?
Belle Swartz: Oh, yeah. Okay. Sorry, I'm not on my. My camera. I'm like.
Participant 1: No, it's totally fine. Yeah, this is. This is sort of informal. This is literally just me. I'd set up a similar time or similar.
Belle Swartz: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: Just feel any questions that you have or anything that.
Belle Swartz: Yeah.
Participant 1: You couldn't get to. And support. I've been following along well. And that you see it as it comes, and that really helps us.
Belle Swartz: Yeah. I've been asking a few questions, I guess here and there, but.
Participant 1: Good.
Christian Sheerer: No, I mean, and. And also, if there's really.
Participant 1: If there's nothing, like, I don't hold you guys, but if there are things that we want to put our heads together for, we can start. Yeah.
Belle Swartz: Well, the only thing. I'll wait for Carol because.
Carol Lawson-Body: Oh, hey, Bell. I'm in.
Belle Swartz: Hi. Okay. The only thing. A couple things that I had written down was. So I have two clients yesterday. I did charges for them in nickel, and I got two different messages. One said, cannot authorize at this time. And the other one said, and they were both for credit cards. And one said, failed to create customer. But when I ran them through in our quickbook, through quickbooks with our other system, they. They both went through. So Tiffany said to bring it up to you because we weren't sure why. What those messages meant and how I can fix it going forward if there's something I need to tweak. Maybe. I'm not really sure.
Christian Sheerer: Okay. Which. Which ones were those for?
Belle Swartz: So for Marie Maria Zerabo, Z E R B O, There's. There's probably no balance now, but there was a balance, and I ran. I had to end it up. She said to. She said to try them in QuickBooks. And three. Two out of the three went through in QuickBooks. The other one's still declining. But the Zerbo said, cannot authorize at this time.
Participant 1: That's a mastercard at the end of 0322.
Christian Sheerer: What?
Participant 1: Yeah, that is a MasterCard with 0322.
Belle Swartz: I can't hear you. I'm sorry. It's like.
Christian Sheerer: Can you hear me now?
Belle Swartz: I can. I think it's, like, depending on if you talk into your mic or not. Maybe I heard you say that doesn't match something.
Christian Sheerer: Oh, no, no, no. I was saying the payment method is MasterCard 022032.
Belle Swartz: Ah, that's what you were asking? Okay, let me check one second. I have to just go back to my other system and look.
Christian Sheerer: Hold on one second.
Belle Swartz: Sorry, Serpo. And so credit card is ending in. Yes, 0322.
Christian Sheerer: Okay.
Participant 1: Yeah, I see that we don't have any transaction history with our. So I will.
Christian Sheerer: Okay.
Participant 1: What was the other one?
Belle Swartz: And the other one is for Daniel Landis. And that one said, fail to create customer, and that one and that one ends in 8,532.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, I see that. That's weird, because I see it as a customer in nickel.
Belle Swartz: Yeah, I mean, I see it too. And then when I try to charge it, I get that little message that says, like, an error message, and it says, failed to create customer.
Christian Sheerer: Okay. My guess is that it's an issue.
Participant 1: With the card, but it worked on. So which.
Belle Swartz: It worked in QuickBooks.
Participant 1: Yeah, Landis. Landis and Zerbo worked in QuickBooks.
Belle Swartz: They both worked.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. Okay. And then. Okay, okay.
Belle Swartz: The third one, I think the card's just declining, so that's why that one didn't go through.
Christian Sheerer: Okay.
Belle Swartz: So the first message I got for Zerbo said, cannot authorize at this time, and for Landis said, failed to create customer.
Christian Sheerer: And these were yesterday.
Belle Swartz: Mm, yeah.
Participant 1: Yeah.
Belle Swartz: And then the declined one just said, cannot authorize at this time. Wait, I'm sorry. The decline one. Wait, can I service it? Oh, okay. Oh, the decline one said, call insurer. So.
Christian Sheerer: Okay. Landis and Zerbo. Okay, I'll make sure.
Belle Swartz: Okay. And then the only other thing I wanted to ask, I think we might have mentioned this is if there was any way to. To do any type of sorting besides, like, descending date order. If we could sort by alphabetically or sort. What was the other way I wanted to sort? Let me. And are you guys still working on the download receipt part? Yeah, I guess if there was just any way we could. Like, sometimes it. When we're dealing with spreadsheets, at the top, there's, like, a arrow button, and you can sort alphabetically and that kind.
Christian Sheerer: Of thing, on which.
Belle Swartz: Basically. Well, see, customers, it Looks like they're in alphabetically. Yeah. Customers. They're in alphabetically. I guess it would be invoices. So where.
Christian Sheerer: Customer?
Belle Swartz: Yeah, because sometimes just instead of. I know you can always filter. Yeah, but sometimes I charge my clients, like alphabetically. My list is alphabetical. So then if this was alphabetical, just make sure. Make it a little easier. But I mean, it's not the end of the world. But if there was a way to.
Christian Sheerer: Do that, I think.
Participant 1: Yeah, I think I agree with you. That might be something that.
Belle Swartz: Or also maybe if you could search by.
Participant 1: Search in the invoice.
Belle Swartz: Maybe search by. Sometimes to search by like dollar amount. I'm not sure.
Christian Sheerer: You can search by amount.
Participant 1: Requested value in invoices. You just put a little range in minimum requested and maximum requested amount.
Belle Swartz: Hey, I'm sorry, did you just ask me something?
Participant 1: No, no, I'm saying the opposite. I'm saying that you can filter.
Christian Sheerer: I'm in your guidance.
Belle Swartz: So I see. You can search, but you can sort by date, by invoice date.
Christian Sheerer: You can add a filter for the requested value. So if you wanted to see all of them.
Participant 1: Okay, 1000.
Carol Lawson-Body: Oh, I see.
Participant 1: So these are all ones that are between 1,000 and 5,000.
Christian Sheerer: But I sort of agree with you.
Participant 1: Here that like, the same way that you can go like this, you should be able to do that on the customer as well. Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, I will. I will. I will raise that.
Participant 1: That should be a small thing that they might be able to fix it.
Christian Sheerer: But I mean.
Belle Swartz: Okay, great. Carol, did you have anything?
Carol Lawson-Body: No, I think the only thing for me was just the download receipt stuff. But if it's still in process, then all good.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, yeah, I'll make.
Participant 1: I. I'll give an update regarding that.
Christian Sheerer: And yeah, I mean, we always talk.
Participant 1: About how communicative you guys are in support and how much we appreciate that. So if there's any weird things that come up, I keep that up. Because all the way up to the C. CTO and CEO the seats closer to, you know, internal to the product and fixing engineering stuff.
Christian Sheerer: He's like, fully aware of all that stuff too. So I'll do my job in like.
Participant 1: Raising this stuff to him. Try to give him a.
Christian Sheerer: Explanation on.
Participant 1: ZBO and Landis as well as what we could do in terms of just like filtering one by a customer. I'm sure that's something that they would listen to and be like, wait, yeah, obviously we should do that. But then the promises is whatever, but I'll get you an explanation for that. And then the thank you timeline on the tabular university.
Carol Lawson-Body: Nice. Yeah, that's kind of it for me, for the most part. Yeah.
Belle Swartz: Yeah. And the download receipt, I mean, it's. It's there. It just literally flashes for like five seconds and then it is.
Christian Sheerer: It is it. I remember it was like 25 for Bell.
Belle Swartz: I know I'm down to, like, much less than that now. I don't know. Like, I. I download, I downloaded. It's less than 25% that it actually. The box actually stays there and lets you click on it to download. The rest of them just pop up like. Like in a second, it disappears. You don't have time to click on the box. Is that what happens, Carol?
Carol Lawson-Body: Yeah, that's been happening for me for a while. It was only my ECH clients when it happened to you. And on my credit card for sure was popping up. And I didn't do my billing last week. Tiffany did. So I can't speak to last week's. But I do know for this week's billing, it also happened to a few of my credit card customers. But I just took the link up top and copied it and got it that way.
Belle Swartz: Yeah.
Carol Lawson-Body: But, yeah, at first it wasn't happening to any of my credit cards, and now it kind of is. So it probably is like, closer to 20, but it's not anything like, wild or, like, over the top by any means.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, so it's gotten somewhat better, but we have, like, work to do.
Carol Lawson-Body: Yeah, just a little bit.
Belle Swartz: Yeah, yeah, mine. Yeah, mine is like, I'd say, I mean, 20%. I'd say about 15% lets me do it, and the other 85 do not.
Christian Sheerer: Oh, okay.
Belle Swartz: Yeah, okay.
Participant 1: Okay.
Belle Swartz: And then I was trying to look for a pattern, and I. I agree with Carol that it might. Might let me download a little bit more for the credit cards, but I don't think it's 100% consistent for credit cards.
Participant 1: Yeah.
Belle Swartz: And sometimes an ACH will let me download and some, you know, so I don't think there's a rhyme or. I don't know if there's a rhyme or reason.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, a database thing.
Participant 1: Like a volume thing.
Christian Sheerer: And I'll get you answered by today.
Participant 1: Customer. Okay, cool. Awesome. Let me do that. And then I'll create with you guys asynchronously so that.
Christian Sheerer: Our team here, who.
Participant 1: Handles existing customer is going to be basically taking the spot of me in these types of conversations where they're kind of acting as a filter for. And your consistent use of nickel into the long term.
Christian Sheerer: Okay.
Belle Swartz: Are we meeting again? Next week, same time or. I wasn't sure. Are we doing this weekly for a while, or did you want to.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, I. Absolutely, we can.
Participant 1: Is that something you want to set up now?
Belle Swartz: I mean, I guess we can let Tiffany communicate with you and let you know if we're meeting again. I'm not really sure sure she wants it every week or not.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, it could be, I mean, you know, at the cadence.
Participant 1: Or bi weekly or eventually. I think once we smooth.
Christian Sheerer: Keep smoothing.
Participant 1: Smoothing out these things, maybe to a monthly cadence, even to a quarterly cadence. But we're so early. It's only been a month, which is crazy. And so, like, you know, earlier.
Christian Sheerer: Right.
Participant 1: More touch points, the better.
Belle Swartz: Okay, thank you.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, no problem. I'll send over an invite just so.
Participant 1: We can have it as a placeholder, but I can coordinate with Tiffany and you all asynchronously on that if we need to move it around. And I'll introduce you to my team at Colton, who. Our customer success manager, whose time just.
Christian Sheerer: Basically would take the role that I'm taking right now.
Carol Lawson-Body: Nice.
Belle Swartz: Okay, cool.
Carol Lawson-Body: Also, I just had one question. I know we've been talking to support and having these chats. Has there been any, I guess, feedback from the type of questions that we ask Support where they would recommend that we use nickel in a different type of form flow than we are? Like, I guess, is there just, like, any, like, helpful user tips that our questions are sparking or for the most part, like, we're using it as effectively as we can? I just want to.
Christian Sheerer: Really. Good question.
Carol Lawson-Body: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. I mean, I can. I can have.
Participant 1: That's something that we want to process everything right. Like me, and we want to distill down any patterns that we can find. The feedback I've gotten is like.
Christian Sheerer: They'Re great.
Participant 1: They ask the right questions. They think, you know, they're helping us.
Christian Sheerer: You know.
Participant 1: Build on top of an already great thing. Like, little tweak stuff that we have to do. Like, even the kind of reimbursement stuff on the credit card fee thing that Tiffany or one of you raised, that.
Christian Sheerer: Was a big value add for, like, a couple of other customers, too. And so the general feedback, without getting.
Participant 1: I haven't heard any two specifics of it. I think that's a good project for us to take on. Darrell is like, oh, you know, are the patterns that we're noticing that we can kind of distill into just, you know, communication. And that is sort of the function in the customer success role too. Right. It's like, to be Able to analyze those patterns and support them and be like, oh, I think actually, you know, six of these questions are solved by changing a slight. I think that's something that we.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah.
Participant 1: That I'll look into and see. But the general thrust of the feedback has been, like, great questions, really good customer, super nice. And not hesitant to, like, point out things that are not working for them, which I think I would continue if I were y'. All.
Carol Lawson-Body: Okay, nice. Thank you. Just curious.
Belle Swartz: Yeah, thank you.
Christian Sheerer: No, I think it's really good. Really good point.
Participant 1: Like, we should be able to distill down on the patterns, and I think.
Christian Sheerer: As more usage comes. Right.
Participant 1: In one month, there'll be more patterns that emerge.
Carol Lawson-Body: Lovely. Okay, cool.
Participant 1: Cool.
Carol Lawson-Body: Oh, yeah, we'll just keep using it as we are, and we'll see what emerges from there.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. If there's any glaring things to.
Participant 1: I think we'll be able to put it in also.
Christian Sheerer: Awesome.
Participant 1: Cool.
Belle Swartz: Okay, well, thank you.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, no problem. I will. I'll send an invite, and we don't.
Participant 1: Have to hold it.
Christian Sheerer: That might be a good place that.
Participant 1: We can introduce Colton to you all.
Christian Sheerer: And start building out that cadence, and then we can coordinate asynchronously if there's.
Participant 1: Like, a better time that works on a bi weekly. Weekly, or, you know, over time setting up. Okay, good.
Belle Swartz: All right. Well, have a good weekend.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, you too.
Participant 1: Huh?
Carol Lawson-Body: Have fun in Mexico. That's where you are right now.
Christian Sheerer: Oh, yeah, we're here right now. Yeah, it's really awesome. Honestly, it's super cool. Now I need to come back with.
Participant 1: More time for daily daddy.
Christian Sheerer: You know, I've had enough to kind.
Participant 1: Of go around in the evenings, but.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, it's such a different place, different.
Participant 1: Type of rhythm, which is I would like to experience throughout the entire day.
Christian Sheerer: But it's great.
Participant 1: Yeah, it's been awesome. Thank you.
Belle Swartz: Cool.
Christian Sheerer: All right. Yeah, you guys have a good weekend, too. And I will get. I will get those four things clarified.
Participant 1: In the next couple hours.
Belle Swartz: Great. Thank you.
Carol Lawson-Body: Thanks.
Belle Swartz: All right. Take care.
Carol Lawson-Body: Bye.
Belle Swartz: Bye.
