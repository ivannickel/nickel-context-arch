Christian Sheerer: Sorry about that. Was stuck in another call. Very busy today, but better than sitting around and doing nothing. So feel blessed.
rachel: I get that completely. We appreciate your time. Hopefully we won't keep you too long.
Christian Sheerer: No worries. Yeah, no, no, no. We have the 30 minutes. Is that still good for you guys?
rachel: Yeah, 30 minutes would be great. We'll try to do the hard stop if that's okay, because we have some other stuff this evening. We'll be good. I think we should be able to make it through the 30 minutes.
Christian Sheerer: Awesome. Yeah. Okay, cool. Good to let me know that we have that deadline. All right. Well, I think like to introduce myself, accounting executive here, kind of help people think through Nickel at a high level and then also how it meets sort of their business. What would be helpful for me at the four is to sort of understand how you guys currently do payments today and like what made you want to spend the end of your day with a salesperson, considering maybe you have some ideas about how Nickel can fit in there.
rachel: So we're actually working on our startup for the business. So we don't do any of it, but we want to do it right from the start. So that's why we were looking into this to make sure that when it comes to the transaction side of things, that we are good to go. So we're working on starting up a photo booth business. So a lot of our transactions will be that the ACH, so a higher percentage with just an invoice versus trying to do everything with the credit card. And so when we saw what Nickel provides with no fees and charges with the invoicing aspect for those high dollar, if you wanna say invoices, that's why we wanted to reach out to see how we can utilize this platform potentially for working with our clients.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, yeah. And so this should be, Pretty quick then we can give like a nice cursory overview. What is the type of payment you think, like what is the method of payment that you think you'd be charging people?
rachel: So we're going to do two different approaches. So if we go to a farmer's market, and if I'm not explaining this correctly, let me know. This is just how I'm answering this question. If we go to like a farmer's market, we're hoping to be able to do like a square, Square or Venmo or Zelle or something along those lines for individual photos. But for weddings and corporate events, birthday parties, whatever it might be, we plan to send an invoice and then they can choose to pay with the AC. I always forget what the ACH stands for, but, like, just be able to wire us the money they could Zelle it or Venmo, but Ideally, we can send them an electronic invoice for them to pay us back or wire us the money versus having to get a $700 credit card charge and then have all those percentage fees attached to it.
Christian Sheerer: So point of sale and invoice.
rachel: That might have been an easier way to explain it. We're still working on it.
Christian Sheerer: No, no, no, the color is good. No, no, no. The detail is better, actually. Your way of explaining is better because I'm going to ask you more questions now.
rachel: To.
Christian Sheerer: And so are you thinking so then so for the point of sale, you would have somebody there, like in a bar or something, wherever the photo booth would be, you would have somebody there to accept point of sale payments?
rachel: Yes.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah.
rachel: For the individual photos. I mean, this, so this is going to be out of a a retro 60s van. That's what it's going to be out of. Okay, so at the farmers markets, there'll be someone in there running the booth, and they'll accept, whether that's that scan, that tap, whatever you want to do, payment wise, for those events. And then we'll just send over, like, the invoice for the larger events where they pay either 50 down. A month out and then we get the rest of the payment the week of the event or however the heck you want to do it.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. I got you. Are you thinking of doing more of one or the other?
rachel: I mean, ideally it would be more of the hourly events, like the corporate weddings. Those will take most of Hopefully those are the what's taking most of our time.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I hear you.
rachel: Higher dollar value events.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. Awesome. Well. I think, yeah, we'll be uniquely set up to help with those invoices for now. Do you have a time when you're going to start? Do you have a plan in place for when you're going to start rolling the van out?
rachel: Probably November, December. If everything works out perfect, we'll see.
Christian Sheerer: Okay. Yeah, it's good to have a goal. Just like a plan against because by then we might also have point of sale. So we don't really typically do point of sale unless you're sending a link. So our internet based online payments are all tracked against a link. So I send somebody an invoice and there's a link to pay the invoice and nickel and they go in and they click that link and then they get to choose whether they're going to pay via credit card or ACH. ACH stands for automated clearing house. It's just a way for... Yeah, yeah. It's just a way, it's just a term for moving bank to bank rather than through the credit card processor with the account and routing number stuff. And so there are so many three letter acronyms that I have in my head that, you know... You're good.
rachel: And so if we don't know, I'll let you know.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, yeah. So you send a link to somebody, then yeah, they can pay either upfront, it's however you sort of want to determine it. They pay upfront or they pay half of it, or you could send two invoices, one for the deposit, one for at the time of the event. You could send one invoice and you say, hey, pay all of it now or pay half of it now and you track in nickel, you can see if there's an outstanding balance due. Or what the amount is that they've paid against the total amount that is charged for the overall event. That would be one way. You could also send those links or have our payments portal connected to your account where you could create a QR code and I'll pull up payments portal for you. I'll show you here. Where you could have a QR code printed or something like that. That might be super, super easy to do and sleek and have a QR code printed wherein. So this is one of our customers, Chicago brass, and they have a payments portal specifically for those invoices. So somebody can come in and just say, hey, I owe you $50 for some old invoice that I didn't pay or. Right. And then they could go in, make the payment and pay by bank or ACH. Or they could do Apple Pay. But that'll be down the line. So I think this might be a little bit high friction for a point of sale, frankly. But it might be the case that by December we have, because we have a lot of people. Nickel is primarily built for industrial businesses who do a high amount per transaction. Right. And that's why we're able to build out the payments infrastructure so that ACH fees are 0% and pass on the credit card to the customer. And so because of that, haven't prioritized yet point of sale, but we're getting a lot of contractors who are on building sites and need to collect payments at the time of finishing a project. Asking for that feature. And so that's something that's on the roadmap. So it might be by the time come December, we have point of sale plus those larger event invoices. But I think for now, you'd probably use it for those larger event invoices that you're sending a particular link to somebody tied to an invoice which is connected to your accounting system of some kind. And then they go in, they receive that link and they choose to pay how they want. And so those fees will always be passed on to them if they're paying via credit card. And then there is 0% on the ACH side.
rachel: Okay, cool. Well, how do we know how, because I already created for the zero, the free account, I've already made one of those in nickel for us just to like go into the system and kind of look around at it. How do we, how would we find out, do we have to have like a monthly, subscription to be able to find out if you guys start to roll out the POS systems or... Oh, you'll know.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, yeah. We'll make sure as new features get unlocked that the people who are in our existing customer base know.
rachel: Okay. And if we were already paying, say, like, I think the next tier up was like the $23 a month, or maybe it was like, that's what it breaks out to annually, but the next one that you would pay for besides the free one, is there like a grandfathered program that you guys do? So like, anything along those lines where if we were already paying and then say there's new features that roll out, you can just automatically have that there or if prices increase in the future.
Christian Sheerer: Depending on the future. If prices increase, you'll have the one that you sign up for for the term, right? It's an annual term. And so if you're paying the $420, which is $35 a month for the year, you'll have that for the year for sure.
rachel: And then the next year it could potentially increase if your guys' prices increase, it's just the name of the game.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, you know, inflation is a thing. And. Feature depth might be a different story by the time we get to next year. Our goal is to not pull the rug on our customers. We have gained a lot of favor with people who came from other payment providers that randomly started to throw hidden fees and hidden percent surcharges in and stuff like that. So that's not our intention at all, but as the value of using Nickel by customers increases? Yeah, it might be the case. But I could also see a world where we keep it 35 for the same set of features.
rachel: Yeah, no worries, I get it. I just have utilized HR systems in the past with the company they grandfathered people in sometimes. Sorry, the dog. He just wanted to say, yeah, that was, okay, cool. And then, so when I was looking at the platform, I saw, so it would automatically track basically all of our transactions in there and you can export it to Excel to be able to do, because I'm trying to, with small business, you know, with all of the costs that come with it, trying to do as much as we can. In the most cost efficient way. So tracking our finances ourselves. So having that ability to export it, that would kind of just remain the same. And there's like that dashboard aspect of it, right? If I was looking at it correctly. Okay.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. And if you have an accounting software like QuickBooks Online, we can just push that to it automatically.
rachel: Okay. Do you think that it would be nice? It's like if you guys already have that little place that you can track everything, wouldn't it kind of already be simultaneous, like kind of duplicating the work?
Christian Sheerer: I'm not as versed in like really what ERPs do, but I know that a majority of our customers use an ERP. Okay. An accounting system. I don't know what ERP stands for, but it's an accounting system.
rachel: Me either, but I have figured it was something like QuickBooks.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, yeah. And a majority of them use QuickBooks and that's why we built out that integration. I think there's some things that we would never replicate. I can't really speak in depth to what they are.
rachel: That's fine.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, but managing of your chart of accounts and stuff like that, that's what ERPs are built to do and we're built to make sure payments go fast and are cheap.
rachel: Okay, cool. I thought I had a question and I lost it. Did you have any? No, I mean, same questions you've been asking. Okay, one second. I need to pull up. So if I lose you with my video, hold on. I had your guys' website here with the pricing for the subscriptions. I can't find it in a second because I guess one of my things I was trying to figure out was like the turnaround time and what that kind of aspect looks like between the different tiers. The pay that you... The turnaround time and any kind of fees.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. Yeah, fees are 35 bucks a month to use Nickel.
rachel: Okay. Like, doesn't matter what it just, you wait all the features regardless at the 35.
Christian Sheerer: There's a free plan, right? Which is three business day turnaround time for ACH.
rachel: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: And two business day turnaround time for credit card payments.
rachel: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: Nickel Plus, which is 35, is two day. Turnaround for ACH and one day turnaround for credit card.
rachel: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: Nickel Plus also allows you to do have unlimited users. If it's just you two, maybe that's not really relevant. Okay. It also you can schedule payments, like recurring payments. So there's a higher transaction limit. I don't know if you guys would even touch close to the transaction limit on, on, on the free plan, which is 25 000 per transaction. But you can go above 25 000 per transaction on plus. Yeah.
rachel: I mean, if we can hit twenty five thousand dollars for whatever reason, like you should be. I'm just kidding. If somebody wants to pay us 25 grand for a.
Christian Sheerer: Then I'll go. Yeah, I'll go gamble because there's a lot going around.
rachel: Yeah, honestly, that's yeah, exactly. Okay, so essentially since I created that account then we can integrate it into our website like how did that pay invoice aspect like you showed us if we wanted to down the road or is it so since I like sign us up it's basically if we want to send an invoice now all I got to do is just follow the steps and we're good to go.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, pretty much. I would probably start on free. For now.
rachel: Okay. Okay. And then if there's any questions since we were able to speak with you, do I just can I just email you if I'm like, hey, I have questions or is there like a specific support person? Like I just want to support.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, you can always email me and I might direct you to support, but you can always email me if that's easier. But there's support@getnickel.com which is for more of that tech side of stuff.
rachel: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: If you think there's something that you think you could figure out without like a tech issue being involved, then feel free to email me and I can answer it the best to my ability. But yeah, support is really good. And yeah, that's more of like, hey, I got locked out for some reason or something like that.
rachel: Okay. So if we ever wanted to upgrade.
Christian Sheerer: Our plans... Yeah, you can just upgrade without asking too.
rachel: Okay. Well, you spent the time to work with us, so I want to make sure if there's anything we can do in regards to working with you going in the future as we utilize this the software and stuff that we can make sure if you get kicked back for anything, we help you.
Christian Sheerer: Oh, absolutely. No, no, no, I hear you and I appreciate it. I got you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But yeah, yeah, yeah. No, if it's quicker, you can upgrade.
rachel: In the platform too.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, awesome. It's not like I need to send.
rachel: You a contract or anything, which sometimes is the case. Okay, perfect. Awesome. And then we'll just essentially, with us having an account, your company just sends out Hey, this is new features that we have, like a little email or something. So if you guys do roll out the point of service features, then we would just notify, we would figure that out then. Yeah, we'll have big blasts.
Christian Sheerer: That's easy now. Yeah, yeah. Cool.
rachel: Sounds good.
Christian Sheerer: Well, this was easier.
rachel: I apologize if I didn't, if I took up some of your time, it's more self-explanatory than I realized. It seemed too good and simple to be true, to be honest.
Christian Sheerer: No, it's okay. I mean, that's why I'm here, is like sort of explain the context behind that and also help think through things like this is why I like the job is like, you can critically think about software. Software should be easy to use and should be straightforward, but you also need to think of it as like, okay, I'm inputting a simple and straightforward thing into my business, which is like previously was not simple and straightforward. So like, how do I reconcile those two states of the status quo and this improved state? And so that, Yeah, no, I mean, I'm happy to do it.
rachel: Awesome. We appreciate it. Do you have any questions? No, we're good here. All right, well, this was super easy. Thank you. You just kind of affirmed that it was going to be easier than I thought.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, yeah, no worries. And if you run into anything, I'll send a recap with stuff that we just chatted about and kind of point you in the direction of what you need. But yeah, I mean, I would say don't pay for it until you're running transactions. Yeah, cool.
rachel: We're on the same page there, don't worry. Awesome, awesome. Thank you.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, no problem. Thank you all.
rachel: Yep, bye.
