Jacob Greenberg: Hi Gabriela, can you hear me?
Participant 1: Yeah, hi Jacob. I can hear you.
Jacob Greenberg: Hi, good to see you. I'm happy you could join today.
Participant 1: Thank you.
Jacob Greenberg: We're still waiting on Natalie here?
Participant 1: Yeah, we're still waiting.
Jacob Greenberg: She did give me a heads up that if she doesn't join, I should call her directly.
Participant 1: Yeah, I think she just sent me the Link already, so I think she is going to join soon.
Jacob Greenberg: Cool. So, Gabriela, I know that Natalie, you know, I reached out to her initially with Lumine HR and then she also let me know some interest. Oh, here she is. Hi, Natalie.
Participant 1: Made it.
Jacob Greenberg: I was prepared to call yourself up.
Participant 1: Yes, that's right. Yep. It's a good thing to have in your back pocket.
Jacob Greenberg: Well, I'm happy we can make time to join. I'm happy Gabriela, you can join as well today. Thank you. So yeah, I just want to get a quick recap before we dive into everything. So purpose of our call is just to learn a little bit more about nickel, a little bit more about your operations currently, kind of where you guys each individually fall in the processes that you currently have, what responsibilities are going in which direction and what those process actually look like. So as far as the last conversation I had with Natalie, I reached out because Natalie, you had created an account for Luminate. Am I saying that correctly? Luminate on Nickel a little bit over a week ago and I reached out just to check in. After a brief conversation, we thought there might be some alignment with the solution and Southeastern Technical as well. So if you guys can introduce yourselves a little bit as far as roles and catch me up to speed a little bit.
Participant 1: Okay, I'm Natalie and my husband owns the business and so I do just pretty much a little bit of everything for the past maybe six months or so. My bookkeeper quit and so I took on all the bookkeeping responsibilities and then thankfully I found Gabriela who has been with us maybe three weeks or so, not very long. I lose track, it could be longer than that. And so she's coming up to speed with all of the bookkeeping responsibilities and so I'm kind of handing some of that off, but ultimately I would be making this type of decision, like whether or not we used a nickel or something like that.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, cool. And then walk me through a little bit more background on, I know we caught it briefly over the phone, Natalie. Would you mind jogging my memory and maybe giving some more detail to Luminate versus Southeastern Technical and some business background?
Participant 1: Right. So, Luminate actually is kind of a right now side business in a sense.
Jacob Greenberg: It is.
Participant 2: There.
Participant 1: Well, it's really not worth explaining too much. we Gabriela is one of our Panamanian employees. And so we have Lumineer, Panama, Lumineer, US and ideally we would hire lots of Panamanian employees and have them work in various other places, but right now it's just Southeastern. She and another person work for South Eastern. And so have to pay the US company, which pays the Panamanian company so that I can pay all the payroll costs. And so there's just one bill a month for Lumine or one payment a month for Lumine. And so I wanted to test out nickel on that. And so it's a newer company. So I started a QuickBooks account for them and was just doing the QuickBooks transactions through QuickBooks. And yeah, they have outrageous fees for the transfers. And so for the Luminate, it's more than for the Southeastern. And you told me that there's a delay for the legacy accounts like Southeastern, but it's coming. And frankly, I think they're outraged already and even higher. And so Southeastern is a managed IT services company in the United States serving the United States clients. And billing for that is just insane. Like our bookkeeping is just insane. It's all kind of complicated. But I guess we bill a number of the companies or some of the companies on the first of the month, some of the companies on the 15th of the month, and for projects or anything that's not part of the monthly recurring stuff. we bill when it finishes. And so there's, you know, I don't know, as many as 75 to 100 invoices a month for Southeastern. And some of them just send checks. Some of them we do the, we got signed agreements for the ACH stuff. And so we will press the button and pull the money. and some of them just use the button and the QuickBooks notification.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay.
Participant 1: All through all three methods of payment. I only accept with very few exceptions, ACH payments just because the fees for credit cards are so high. And so.
Participant 2: Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, gotcha. Can you walk me through a little bit more? I know you said you're doing 75 to 100 invoices a week on the Southeastern side. You guys are using QuickBooks, correct?
Participant 1: Right now? Correct.
Jacob Greenberg: It's actually a month, like 75, 80, 90. A month, yeah. Wow, okay. Gotcha. And the size of these transactions, so I know that you're accepting them through multiple different channels. Some places you have a contract so that you can auto pull Pretty some of that. much just off the top before I dive into it, everything you're doing right now on both Southeastern and on Luminate, you'll be able to do within nickel and it's going to be easier each and every step. So even getting the approval to auto withdraw, if you do want to do that, you can do that as well. But can you walk me through the 75 to 100 invoices that you guys are currently doing at Southeastern? What is the average transaction size for these transactions? you see my.
Participant 1: See my note?
Participant 2: Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, that's okay.
Participant 1: I don't know that there's an average. It can be anywhere from. Anywhere from.
Participant 2: To.
Participant 1: It can really be anywhere from. From there. There's not really an average. We have different types of clients. Managed services is kind of an all-in-one. We manage everything. We provide unlimited support. We provide bundled software with all of the services. And so those are on the higher range. And then we also have people that are really just like super piddly and like hardly buy anything. hardly ever call us and they just pay kind of as they go time and materials. And so those would be on the lower end of that. And there's really not an average. It's really just kind of all over the map.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. So on the low end of the fees that I think you guys were probably incurring right now for doing QuickBooks for Southeastern on the grandfathered rates is anywhere between on the very low end $75 a month on the high end, $1,500 a month with that $15 cap.
Participant 1: So, yeah, I think our cap is up to like 25 or 30.
Jacob Greenberg: Oh, okay.
Participant 1: It started out at $10 and then they've been inching it up.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay. So, I think it's $1,500. Okay.
Participant 1: Yeah, it is capped, but I think it's like $25 or maybe a $30 cap.
Jacob Greenberg: So you're paying somewhere between 1200 bucks to 36,000 bucks annually on these plans.
Participant 1: Maybe I don't think it's that high.
Participant 2: Because.
Participant 1: Not everybody pays through ACH.
Jacob Greenberg: And not everyone has your maxed out highest. But that would be the theoretical range, not including what we expected QuickBooks to potentially go up to as they continue to increase those costs.
Participant 2: Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. So your current process right now is just sending out most of the quick, you're sending some QuickBooks PayLinks, you're collecting some checks. Yes. And you're doing some credit cards as well or?
Participant 1: Hardly any, like maybe one, maybe one or two. And those are on the, like, I actually, I have to hand do those and they call in and because I calculate the fees and I pass them on to them.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. So do you typically discourage credit cards because it's a matter of process?
Participant 2: Oh yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay.
Participant 1: You're too expensive. We can't make a call. They make too much money.
Jacob Greenberg: Awesome. So then walk me through one more time the check balance. Like if you guys, what percentage of what you're doing is checks and what is that process for you after receiving those checks or requesting those checks to make sure everything's set up on your accounting side?
Participant 1: I would say more of the people do checks. Okay, maybe 60 do checks. They just mail them to the office and my mom loves to help. She just loves to be around and help and she wants to come in. So she comes in and she, that's one of the things she does. She does the receipts.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay.
Participant 1: She does the checks. She'll go to the mailbox, get all the checks, and she'll whatever it is you have to do to market paid and QuickBooks, and then she'll create the payment slip or the deposit slip and go to the bank and deposit it.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay.
Participant 1: I don't really have to do anything for that.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay. So it's a bit of a manual process.
Participant 1: You receive the checks.
Jacob Greenberg: Oh, yeah, totally. Have there ever been problems with checks being so manual?
Participant 1: You know, I mean, I don't really like it. Okay. As a preference once.
Jacob Greenberg: Why is that?
Participant 2: Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: Like, why?
Participant 1: It's been a while, right? They won't get delivered or something like that.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay.
Participant 1: It's not been a huge problem. Um, like, we don't lose them all the time or, you know, repeatedly or, like, it's kind of a one-off sort of thing. But I don't like it for that reason. Just that any of them are getting lost is like not good.
Jacob Greenberg: It's okay, it's unreliable.
Participant 1: But we just, I guess, don't like to put too many requirements on our clients. We are smaller and, you know, don't feel like we have the weight to just tell our clients what they're gonna do.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, so you want to increase the options your clients have to be able to.
Participant 2: Yeah.
Participant 1: So, I mean, I guess, I guess it started out they all sent checks. I don't know when the whole ACH thing came about, but we, we couldn't, we couldn't do that for quite some time. We didn't, we didn't have quickbooks. We had kind of had our own little proprietary system. This was while ago years ago. And so, you know, we just always had checks, and then at some point we went to quickbooks, and then that was an option. and then your clients kind of slowly, some of them like that idea and use it. Some of them don't. Some of them have their personal, their particular process at their business where they like printing the checks and there's some sort of check and balance that they have in their process where that's part of what they do. And, and so I just, we've never been at a point where we want to tell them, you have to do this now.
Jacob Greenberg: Absolutely. And, okay, so that's a little bit of the, philosophy we have here at Nickel as well is to be able to provide in a singular platform all the opportunities and options that a customer or vendor might want to pay or receive a payment from so that they don't have, they're not forced to make a decision. But what we've noticed is a lot of businesses end up preferring this payment method or this one, right? Because they had this problem with this method in the past or this is too expensive or whatever. And so they've limited the options for the customers. So what we wanted to do was remove for businesses to accept all the different types of payments they could possibly accept so that it's no problem if a customer decides to pay by credit or decides to pay by check or decides to pay by ACH. So I'll open up my demo environment in a moment and walk you through what that looks like. But yeah, I mean, last month or this month, a lot of the calls that I've been having are people who made a payment through Nickel. to someone who is a nickel user and wow, that was really easy. Let me see how this tool works and maybe I can do the same thing for my customers. So it is really about giving the options to the people.
Participant 1: Now one thing out of this, I don't think this matters, but I will say this as well. So for our for our IT business, everything that we do is in another system called AutoTask, which you probably aren't familiar with, doesn't matter, but like it has all throughout the month, right? We create tickets, different texts work on them. They record their time, what they did, they attach attachments or whatever it is that they do. All of our recurring subscriptions are managed through that. And the invoices are actually generated by AutoTask and imported into QuickBooks.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, great.
Participant 1: They go out from QuickBooks.
Jacob Greenberg: Perfect.
Participant 1: And that's how that works.
Jacob Greenberg: So you guys use QuickBooks Desktop or QuickBooks Online?
Participant 2: Online.
Jacob Greenberg: Fantastic. All right, so I'll walk you through integrating QuickBooks with NIchol. Okay. And what happens is if you're getting the invoices generated and then pushed into QuickBooks, it will then push directly from QuickBooks into NIchol. So you could think of NIchol you as can the think platform of QuickBooks for all as of your your financial accounting operating system. stuff, sending And then and you receiving. still have the other task management software that you guys are using, and they'll all speak with each other through your accounting system being kind of the reconciliation source of truth.
Participant 2: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: Fantastic. And then before I hop in, I know that you have only one payment pretty much for Luminate with Southeastern being the customer. Is that a monthly basis? Is that a quarterly basis, annual basis?
Participant 1: Ideally, it's a monthly basis, but sometimes I just do it when it needs to be done. I don't have any money left. I need to pay some people.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha.
Participant 1: You get money.
Jacob Greenberg: Is that transaction more sizable than the ones at Southeastern?
Participant 2: No.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, it's about the same. Okay, great. The reason I asked specifically is because you can sign up and I'll walk you through the signup process today with Nickel so that you guys can see the environment, get connected, and even do some test runs if you want. Have a free platform. So Nickel Core is free to sign up. There's no monthly fees and it's unlimited free ACH. The only cap on that is that individual transactions have to be underneath $25,000 per transaction.
Participant 1: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: So with Nickel Core or Nickel Plus, excuse me, it's $35 a month. Even if you use that, you'll be saving a minimum of $65 a month from what you're doing in a maximum of several thousand dollars. And the difference with that platform is you can do transactions above 25,000, but it also has a one day quicker ACH turnaround. So two to three days for the free platform, one to two days for the $35 a month platform. Okay. But today we'll get you signed up on the free one. And when you come across a situation or you decide you want to upgrade, it's super easy to do it on your own. So we could get you into that environment just to test today.
Participant 1: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: Fantastic. And just so I know, is this you signed up with Lumine at the beginning of this month? So I'm assuming, but correct me if I'm wrong, this is like an initiative you've already been thinking about taking for a while.
Participant 1: Oh, yeah, for sure.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay. Is there one specific thing that instigated the, all right, it's time for me to look at other solutions?
Participant 2: Well.
Participant 1: I guess because with, with Lumineer wasn't the cap, and so it was, it was a significant snip, even more than it was before. And so that was kind of the thing. I was like, well, let me try this out for Lumineer. I hadn't, actually, because I've been so, so busy. It was kind of the thing that I was like, when I have time, I'll do it.
Participant 2: So.
Participant 1: But you reaching out and saying, Hey, my biggest concern honestly is like, okay, how am I going to integrate this with QuickBooks because the payment link is built into that email and you can't override the link. And so that's my biggest concern. I don't want it to be a huge integration kind of nightmare.
Jacob Greenberg: I'll show you how that works. But the first integration we built years ago was for QuickBooks online. So it's a very seamless smooth process. There's really nothing you need to do besides click integrate with QuickBooks. From there, all the invoices get pushed straight into Nickel and it transforms that payment link into a Nickel payment link instead of through the QuickBooks direct.
Participant 2: Right. All right.
Jacob Greenberg: Let me pop open my environment. I'll walk you through. Well, actually easier yet. How about if would you be comfortable sharing your screen and I can walk you through the signup process and then we could show the different levels of.
Participant 2: The.
Jacob Greenberg: Of the accounts payable and accounts receivable processes.
Participant 1: Let me find a spot to.
Participant 2: Put it.
Participant 1: It's natalie.com or is it Nicole something?
Jacob Greenberg: Get nickel.com. So you go ahead and click get started on the upper right. Or if you already created an account, you can do login. But yeah, let's go ahead and create one for SC technical.
Participant 2: Wow. from all another. . be not. That what you want me to do?
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, great. So have you played around on your own platform for Loom?
Participant 1: I haven't really.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, gotcha. So this is just the summary page. And once we walk through on your side what it looks like so you're familiar, I'll pop into my demo environment just to show you example data to show you some additional extra features. But once you start transacting, this will just be an overview page of the summary of your transactions for accounts receivable and payable. On the left-hand side, you'll see your navigation page. This is your menu to bounce around the tool. So you can go ahead and click on the next one, Transactions for me. All of your transactions will pop up here. When you have QuickBooks synced, it will push all of your invoices automatically. So in QuickBooks, do you also have your customer information, contact information, banking info? Fantastic. So that will all push. Here, this is the transaction page you could download by CSV. You could search by invoice number, invoice purpose, date range or customer. And then we have preset filters for receivables versus payables and refunds. This is a page I'll show you more with my demo data. If you go down now quickly to the account settings on the lower left-hand.
Participant 2: Side.
Jacob Greenberg: This is the first thing you guys should do is create a banner for SE Technical with your guys' logo and you can upload your logo as well. This way on all the payment links is going to be branded to your account. One other thing that I would look at is the company information. Yep, we can go ahead and set this up now if you'd like.
Participant 1: You can keep talking.
Jacob Greenberg: So on the company info here, you see Nickel Pay URL. So you can update this so that it says southeasterntechnical.nickelpayments.com This one right here, Nicole Payne. We'll do that as the get paid section when you set up for your first accounts receivable transaction. You'll have the opportunity to customize what that URL says. So it'll be branded for you guys.
Participant 1: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: While we're on this page, go ahead and click on the farthest right settings option, which is integrations. And this is where you'd link your QuickBooks account.
Participant 2: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: Once this links, it should start to pull some information. We could set this up now if you would like.
Participant 1: I just use my own login with.
Jacob Greenberg: Yep.
Participant 1: Does it time out every so often and have to reconnect?
Jacob Greenberg: It shouldn't time out on you. It's a two-way sync. Everything that you do within Nickel, once a bill's been paid, it will update that for reconciliation purposes in QuickBooks. You don't have to manually do that. So automatic payment links will enable automatically sending a nickel payment link when a QuickBooks invoice is created. So you can do it manually for now and just go ahead and I'll show you the process of sending it.
Participant 2: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: And now let's go into the get paid section or let's go back to transactions really quickly on the left-hand side.
Participant 2: And it might take a little bit.
Jacob Greenberg: Of time for this to start to populate. So later today you should have the integration. You might have to pop into QuickBooks at some point to do an approval. And then go to the get paid section underneath it. This is the set up payment side. So once you go ahead and click set up payments, oh, and you'll see on the right hand side, the QuickBooks logo says sync. So that's because you guys have successfully connected it. And if you click it, Go ahead and click QuickBooks Sync. So now it's initiated and information should start to come through.
Participant 1: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: So on set up payments, if you go ahead and click into that, and I'm just going to give you a quick overview and I could step in in a second to show you more data in the process, but I want you to be aware of like what to expect next when we hop off the call pretty much. This is where you're going to be, again, you could upload your company logo. This will be for the payment links. Right now it's already set. When you send a link, it'll go to southeasterntechnical.nichelpayments.com. You guys are set. I am going to take over now. I'll share my screen and I'll give you some dummy data and walk you through the creation process of invoices.
Participant 2: Second here.
Jacob Greenberg: Can you guys see my screen here?
Participant 2: Yes.
Jacob Greenberg: So once some information starts to come through, you'll see the stuff that comes from QuickBooks because it'll have the QuickBooks icon on it. And if you create something with a nickel and you don't want it synced with QuickBooks, which you wouldn't, it wouldn't have these icons. So these are just examples.
Participant 1: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: So on the transaction, you can create.
Participant 1: It directly in Nickel if you want.
Jacob Greenberg: Absolutely, yep.
Participant 1: And if you do that and somebody pays it, does it invoice go back to QuickBooks if you created in Nickel?
Jacob Greenberg: Yes, it does. It's a two-way sync. So everything that you create in Nickel will also get pushed back to QuickBooks, vice versa. So once you guys start having some transaction information, you'll see the date, the amount, the bank account that you are using, or if you do use a credit card, it'll have a different icon, which way the money is flowing, and what the other location is that it's coming to or going to.
Participant 2: And then the status.
Jacob Greenberg: This will reconcile automatically with QuickBooks. It'll be logged there, but if you want to come in here and use this as a source of truth for reconciliation, you just go ahead and click that, and it will be tagged as reconciled. I'm going to walk you guys through.
Participant 2: Creating an invoice now.
Jacob Greenberg: So the first thing I want to show you is this payments portal. This is more of a generic payment portal. It won't be on an invoice to invoice basis, but we have some customers like Chicago brass is one of our older customers. They'll have a pay now link on their website and you go to it and it's Chicago brass branded and so they could just make a payment here. But most invoices for most of our customers are on an invoice to invoice basis. It's not typically that generic portal.
Participant 1: That'S usually helpful.
Jacob Greenberg: We have a lot of contractors that use nickel, and when they're in the field and they need to accept a payment before leaving the job site, they might do that instead.
Participant 1: All right, that's fine.
Jacob Greenberg: But you can access that here at all times. We'll go ahead and create a new invoice. If you want to create a recurring invoice, you'd click recurring here. So if you have customers that pay on a monthly basis or on a bi-monthly basis, or for the same thing with bill pay, if you have bills that you pay on a monthly basis, like rent or utilities, for you recurring could set up payments. recurring invoice or Once the QuickBooks Sync completes, you'll have all of your customer information loaded here, but you could also create a new customer. So I'll do a new one as a test. So I'll do Natalie test. I'll put my email information here so that I can show you what it looks like to receive a first time transaction email from Nickel, from your account. When you guys do invoices, is it mostly invoice numbers or do you put in purposes for the description?
Participant 1: Invoice numbers.
Jacob Greenberg: Invoice numbers. Okay, great. So put some random numbers here, put an invoice amount, and you can again set it for one time or recurring. The invoice date is the date that the invoice is created, and then you can set a due date as well. So your customers can also opt in to have you guys auto withdraw from their account. Same way they have with the contracts in the past, they could do that by clicking a button on Nickel. I'll walk through that process with you in a little bit once we process this first invoice. But the due date will be when that is auto withdrawn if they do have it set up. And if not, it's just a reminder for them to pay it at that point. It also makes it easier for you to track internally. So you can quickly go through and say, all right, it's the end of August. Here are the 15 invoices and you'll be able that to are quickly outstanding click and a haven't button to remind been paid.
Participant 1: Them.
Jacob Greenberg: And I'll show you that in a moment as well.
Participant 1: If they have auto, if they have auto withdrawal set up or allowed or permission given or whatever, and I set the due date to be, you know, maybe 8:30, will Nickel automatically say, hey, it's the 30th, it should be due, and Nickel will initiate it, or do I manually have to initiate it?
Jacob Greenberg: If you set it for auto with the due date, it will auto withdraw.
Participant 2: I.
Jacob Greenberg: Love that reaction.
Participant 1: Because I can't remember to do it.
Participant 2: Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: But the other, it will do the.
Participant 1: Most important thing we do.
Jacob Greenberg: It will do it. But it will also remind you if you have people that aren't set up on auto.
Participant 1: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: So it'll make it a lot easier no matter what. You can go ahead and put in any notes for the customer. So if you want to put in a description of what this is, so I'll do Testing with Natalie and Gabriela. Then you can also upload documents. I upload this example invoice. If you have a line item invoice or if you have PDF contracts or agreements, photos, whatever it is, you can upload all the documents you want and it's embedded on that individual transaction level, making it a lot easier. Now, before I go to create, I'm going to show you some advanced features here. So you can disable credit card payments if you choose, but disabling credit card payments is pretty much something that very few people do. You might do it on an advance for a specific invoice if that one customer has specifically told you we're not going to pay with credit card, but even if it gives them the option to pay ACH and credit card, so they still choose. So this pretty much is always off. you can allow customers to edit the payment amount also. So if a customer, again, in the interest of providing all the options you can possibly provide to the customers that you guys have, a customer can choose to maybe pay this over time, pay $20 now, $100 next week, et cetera, et cetera, or pay half of it in credit card and half in ACH because they want the points but don't want to put it on their credit card, whatever it is.
Participant 1: I don't think that you guys can do a whole lot about the credit card fees though.
Participant 2: So.
Jacob Greenberg: That'S where this comes in right here. Customized fees on payment request. So right now you're putting the credit card fees on the customer. Now, I understand that when you do credit cards, you have to manually process it, and then you're adding the fees into the invoice. This is, and I'll show you in two seconds what this looks like. It makes it easier so that you have, like, a full and whole accounting system. You only charge the customer exactly what they owe. We'll add the additional fees, and it doesn't have to be reconciled with a weird 2.8% or 3.3% in your books. Everything is going to be clean on your end. We'll handle the credit card processing fees. And if you want to, you can customize what percentage you put on the customer and what percentage you keep. Much everybody that uses Nickel we'll put 100% on the customer because again, you're going to be provided with a free option of ACH payment and then an option with fees for credit card. Some customers do prefer credit card because it's a cash flow advantage for them. Yeah, some people have 3% cash back anyway, so it kind of evens out. But you know, the reason we included this is we have some larger distribution companies that have specific deals with other manufacturers they work with. that prefer to get that cash flow advantage but don't want to pay that full percentage, so they'll share the cost.
Participant 2: Right.
Jacob Greenberg: But for the most part, everything goes on to the customer.
Participant 1: Ah.
Jacob Greenberg: So we'll go ahead and click Create.
Participant 1: Robert is cool.
Jacob Greenberg: And the invoice has been created. This is the invoice number and this is the cost. This is the due date and the invoice date. Now I'm going to send this as an email to myself so you'll see what it looks like showing up in an inbox. you can also copy the link and share it in whichever other way you want. Or if you enter phone numbers, you could text the link to people. It's totally up to you. Now, if a customer has already filled out their information and has agreed to be auto-charged, you just come in here and click schedule charge and it will do it for you. It'll just pull the if that date is the 30th, it will pull on the 30th. If that date is today, it'll pull today. if you have the customer information and you want to manually input it, you can manually input it with QuickBooks. This will automatically populate for you. And then you could do that. But I'll show you what it looks like to send out an invoice to someone who's not on auto charge. So I sent the link and it'll come in like this. this will be De Graaf Distribution as our dummy account. So we created this logo just for demo purposes, but it will have your logo. It'll say Southeastern Technical or Lumina HR. Your logo will be here. So you have a new payment request. Natalie has requested a payment, the amount, the date, where it's from, the number, and the memo. All you do is click Pay Now. A very clean and straightforward payment portal. All the documents you uploaded are here, and if you click it, it will download. All the notes are here. And if they've paid previously and have saved their information, all they do is click pay by card and click pay, and it goes. They don't need to fill it out a second time. But if it's their first time, they could fill it out once and click save and pay. And it will automatically reconcile. Natalie, your smile right now is just the sunshine in my ring. Oh, my God. I'm great. So here you go and you'll be able to see completed payments. So these are all the active ones for the invoices that are out and when their due dates are, you'll be able to see which ones are overdue pretty quickly and you could filter for those as well. And you can see which ones are due upcoming, Etc. But say we made a payment on this one, we just pop into here and we'll see the status is paid. Pretty straightforward. At any point you could click into that invoice. The link for that invoice will always exist. So should you need to revisit that link for whichever reason, you can always do so. Excuse me, you can see that the customer has paid fully. You can see the transaction itself and any reminders that had gone out or if you need to send another reminder if this wasn't paid yet. And if someone says, Hey, you know what? We actually want to pay part of this invoice in credit card and part by CH or can we pay 25% of it now? You could go into that invoice, toggle this on, press, and that same link that they've already had, they could go into it and they'll be able to do that customization.
Participant 2: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: So very, very easy. And here you could go ahead and say they paid a dollar, but they owed Say they said 100 bucks and they only paid a dollar and it's overdue, just click request payment and you'll be able to automatically send out another payment request. Just to remind them.
Participant 1: If they don't pay by the due date, is there a way that it automatically can add late fees?
Jacob Greenberg: To automatically send the payment request. I think that there is. I want to get back to you on technically how to do that because we have a workflow Or if they're.
Participant 1: Automatically getting added in QuickBooks, if there's changes to the invoice in QuickBooks, do those sync over or does it only sync one time?
Jacob Greenberg: Updates will sync over. It's a two-way sync.
Participant 1: So if it happens, so the fees are getting added in QuickBooks, they'll just import.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah.
Participant 1: Okay.
Participant 2: Yay. Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: And I think there is a way to automate a workflow to let people know on that date. But let me follow up with you on that one specifically. Otherwise, it is really easy to see which one is overdue and not paid. Just by it'll have this little request payment tab. So under the AR side, you'll have get paid invoices and customers. So here you'll have your different customers listed. You can see the total balance that they have outstanding. the total amount that they've paid you guys over time. And any active invoices that are out will be counted here. So it's easy to manage on a customer level. And if you want to create a new invoice on a customer level, you could do that as well. On Bill Pay, I actually didn't even here. I have a couple more things to show you on the AR side, but I didn't ask about how you guys are currently doing accounts payable at the moment.
Participant 1: I don't think we do too much accounts payable.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay.
Participant 1: I think I like, I think that's when you're like managing the incoming bills and maybe scheduling when the payments go out and stuff like that. We just gotta pay them when they come in. And like some of them, probably the bigger ones are like automatic withdrawal sort of things. So.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha.
Participant 1: I don't think we do that too much, but.
Jacob Greenberg: Well, if you do those and if you're keeping account of those in QuickBooks, that will also update so that you can manage it all from one portal. So if you want to make sure you're reconciled, if you want to get a quick and easy overview of all of your AR and AP, you could do it already no matter what. It doesn't cost anymore. And if you do want to make payments here or do recurring bills, it's a very similar process to creating the invoice itself. So you just go to new bill, you enter the vendor that you're paying, the amount, when you're going to send it out, and then make the payment.
Participant 1: Okay.
Participant 2: Yeah, very straightforward.
Jacob Greenberg: And you can do the same for recurring bills if you would like, and you'd be able to track all of your recurring bills as well in one place. Okay.
Participant 1: Just makes it a lot easier. We have a few of them that we do, maybe that way. A new vendor, I think, It is sending stacks me up his in stuff.
Jacob Greenberg: The in the QuickBooks.
Participant 1: Bills.
Jacob Greenberg: QuickBooks is fantastic for accounting purposes. At the end of the day, source of truth stuff, the user interflow is a little bit wanting. And when you have so much information in there, it's hard to parse through everything. So this is just a way to make all the financial transaction sides of your business a bit more organized for both yourself and your customer and reduce costs in the process. So let's see here. Want to schedule invoices for the future in the same way when you create one. Bopping around, give me one second here. If we want to add a new customer, so you'll sync all the ones from QuickBooks. But when you do add a new customer, you can set up payment authorization for them. So here, I'll create a new one. Natalie test. Set up payment authorization. There's one email. I already did a Natalie test customer. Okay.
Participant 1: You did actually, yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: So now there's two Natalie tests in our system. I'll add my email address to show you what it looks like and set up payment authorization. Now you can request full limited permission. Full permission is probably what you would want for the things that you're currently doing. You've already sent out contracts to the likes, but if you wanted to do limited, for maybe one specific transaction or for a specific transaction amount, you can do that as well. Set a message. So, hi, Jacob, please agree to let me charge you for upcoming invoices. And you can request it from the customer. You could also enter it yourself if you want to. So if you have existing customer information, you just want to authorize existing customers, you can do it on your own. But here we go, I'm going to do this. Now payment authorization request. Complete payment method forms. Super quick background on what nickel is, what the forms are, how they're protected. Just go ahead and check through these terms and conditions. And then you just go ahead and click Pay by Card. And you fill out this information, they could use Plaid to verify. And once they confirm and authorize, that's it. You're allowed to auto pull from them on the days that you sent and their information is stored in this. Get our account figured out and we.
Participant 1: Can see whether we're going to. I think that getting paid in it, I think getting squared up and getting paid in advance so it doesn't happen again would be good.
Participant 2: Yeah, that would be unusual. You can get paid for that much. Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: Just do some published news on that.
Participant 1: Sorry. People aren't paying and we're about to buy more stuff.
Jacob Greenberg: This is the cash flow problems that we were created to help solve. Like, that's exactly it. And so nickel has completely free ACH, like, you know, and we're pretty much the only people out there doing it. And the reason why we do it is so that people can get familiar with what we've built as a system to make AR and AP a little bit easier so that in the future we could begin to offer other supports. So we're looking at doing trade credit. and other products that can offer cash flow advantages for when people don't pay, but you need to purchase things. Trade credit is like, it's like you'll have, you kind of think of it of like credit card points, but directly towards transactions you'll use for trade. So if you have somebody who's a manufacturer that's purchasing a lot of one type of metal scrap, get trade credit from Nickel so that the next one you could purchase prior to actually having the accounts receivable side be completed so we can forward cash advances or it could essentially make the next purchase cheaper for you when you do make the purchase. On top of that, we'll be building in like net term agreements into the transaction level instead of just the date. all the basic stuff. So, yeah, as far as this goes, you should be set up momentarily with your QuickBooks to make sure everything is synced there. And you can go ahead and run some transactions. Would you guys have, like, I know it's kind of the end of August between now and the end of the month. Are there any test transactions you guys would be able to give it a go on?
Participant 1: Probably there's probably a few that need to be run. Some of the automated ones that I'm supposed to do automatically that I probably haven't done. I haven't told Gabriela that's her responsibility yet, so.
Jacob Greenberg: Got it. so you guys can create multiple user accounts on the system as well.
Participant 1: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: Gabriela, if you want to log in individually or Natalie, you want to have like a parent master account.
Participant 2: Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: And when it comes to Bill Pay, for example, you can set up this approvals tab. So if you do make a payment of a certain size, if Gabriela is making sure that they're all in line and ready to be we sent out. Natalie, if you want to, you can put some custom workflows in place so that you have to go through and just approve or deny them before they go through. Okay, that's here on the workflow tab. Yep. Pretty straightforward.
Participant 1: Yeah, I guess our next round of endreases is on the first.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay.
Participant 1: 10 days out, send out invoices, and then we, we usually make it 10 days after. And if for the ones that are automatic payments, we try to process them on that due date.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay.
Participant 1: Now, I guess my, and this doesn't have anything to do with, with nickel, but, like, I, I kind of like to. somehow notify my people that, right, they're going to be getting a different looking payment thing that it's going to be coming from, from it, from nickel into the quick books. And I don't want them to think that it's a fake thing. Like, I need to somehow get that message out to them. So that's kind of also something that. would have to be done before I could kind of fully, fully move over.
Jacob Greenberg: To the new thing.
Participant 1: But I could probably process the achs.
Participant 2: Through.
Participant 1: The automatic ones.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. So that's what I would do, is I would, before September comes, if you do plan on doing a lot of new transactions via nickel on the top of the month, I would do an email Outreach or some type of Outreach to your existing customers before the month begins, letting them know, hey, In September, we're transitioning to this new accounts receivable platform. It's going to be no change for you guys. Just want to give you the heads up so that you know it's not a scam when it comes in. It's not a scam. You go ahead and do that notification. What we do prefer is that you guys run a couple tests before you do a big push, just to make sure that you're using it and it's checking all the boxes the way it's intended to for you. And so that we can provide any support, whether on our technical team or on our customer success team, Before you guys do a large rollout. So ideally we have about 10 more days left in the month. So ideally you do two to three test transactions this month. Make sure you iron all the kinks or at least just familiar with the workflow. Honestly, how it works before you start initiating the 75 to 100 transactions you guys will be running in September. Gotcha.
Participant 2: Cool.
Jacob Greenberg: So with that in mind, what I typically do is if you guys do plan on doing some test transactions, I'll set up a check update with you guys so that I can make sure I save time on my calendar to be able to catch up and make sure everything went okay. I wouldn't want to do it on the 29th because it's literally the last day of the month before you guys would do all the processes. So I would think maybe next Wednesday or Thursday, if that's all right with you for a quick. Okay, great. Cool. So I'll send another invite for.
Participant 2: Next.
Jacob Greenberg: Week at the same time.
Participant 2: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: Maybe half an hour later at two o'clock actually.
Participant 1: Okay, that's fine.
Participant 2: Great.
Jacob Greenberg: And I'll send that invite to both of you guys. Or Gabriela, I actually don't have your email address, so I could take that down now.
Participant 1: Yeah, let me put it in the chat for you.
Jacob Greenberg: All right. And all right, perfect. That makes sense. And I'll send you guys out another Zoom link for an invite for next week. In the meantime, go ahead and do some test transactions. Let me know how everything's going. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out. And hopefully we'll get you guys set up to do some more transactions and switch systems, save time and money in September.
Participant 1: Okay, sounds good.
Jacob Greenberg: Thank you. All right, guys, have a good rest of your day.
Participant 1: Thank you. Thank you. Bye. Bye.
