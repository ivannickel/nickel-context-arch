Christian Sheerer: Around. No worries. Yeah, Yeah, I just wanted to make.
Jimmy Nguyen: Sure.
Christian Sheerer: We can meet your timeline that you guys described earlier this week. So all good. Happy to do it.
Jimmy Nguyen: Perfect. I believe last night we had finally connected the QBO sync over and got the bank account connected this morning.
Christian Sheerer: Beautiful.
Najeer Ahmed: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: So, yeah, I mean, I can clear up the question that Alex sent over earlier today, which is it'll just be the bank account that you select to. To link up. So plaid won't kind of go into all of the other accounts unless they're linked.
Jimmy Nguyen: Yeah, I think the. It's like an example of one would be we have multiple bank accounts that show up from one, like payment portal. If we were to. Is there kind of like a landing page where it lets us select one or is it just like the entire user account gets imported over?
Christian Sheerer: No, no. Would just be the bank account that you connect.
Jimmy Nguyen: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah.
Jimmy Nguyen: I believe later on today we do have a meeting to talk about how we want to start pushing out some of the invoices. Oh, Alex is sending over an email really quick.
Christian Sheerer: It seems like.
Najeer Ahmed: Cool.
Jimmy Nguyen: Sorry, I'm giving this a quick read. I think he is a little bit busy, so he may not be able to join before the meeting ends today. Okay. I think he just wants a detailed kind of like data information, like what exactly is being synced over. Oh, he's running on in right now. Give him about 20 seconds.
Najeer Ahmed: Okay.
Jimmy Nguyen: Hello.
Najeer Ahmed: Hello.
alexhoehe: Good morning.
Najeer Ahmed: Good morning.
Christian Sheerer: How's it going?
alexhoehe: Very good.
Christian Sheerer: Doing well.
Najeer Ahmed: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: Alex, I was just describing to Jimmy the question that you had regarding the bank integration. It is only going to connect the account that you connect to nickel. It won't give access to all of your accounts.
alexhoehe: Okay, that's good. So, so in, in that situation, if we can sort of select only one particular account that we want to use to receive the payments, is there any issue with that account being sort of a. An underfunded account? Because obviously we were just receiving funds into this account and then moving these funds over to our operating account.
Christian Sheerer: I don't think so. I mean, that's pretty standard. I don't think it's the majority, but it's happens often enough we come across it.
alexhoehe: So. So in terms of like the credit.
Christian Sheerer: Assessment, I understand what the fraud risk models will do.
Najeer Ahmed: I mean, we, we.
Christian Sheerer: I know I, I ultimately we're going to have a look at it once it's connected. And based on what you've described and the way Claudio is looking at it, I don't think that there should be a kind of risk there. But I will note to him that it's likely going to be sort of account that clears out regularly and get his thoughts there.
alexhoehe: Okay. And back to the connection through Play. I understand that play does get the information from our account integration and Play sort of gives you access to a certain amount of information from our account for you to review. Does this information include the overall activity and transactions from all our accounts or only the account?
Christian Sheerer: Only the account that you link up to it with.
Najeer Ahmed: Okay.
alexhoehe: So you would see only the transactions that are coming into this account and going out.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, it would just be the one account that you select to link up with. Plaid.
alexhoehe: So. So the total balances of our main account as well as say, other accounts that are linked to other companies are not going to be disclosed to you. You can confirm that.
Christian Sheerer: I can put that. I can write it out too. That makes you guys more comfortable. But yeah, I can't confirm that it's just the one account that you select.
alexhoehe: That would be perfect. I mean, especially in terms of like just receiving funds. I mean, at a later stage, if you're considering sort of a deeper integration with, with making payments out of our main account, we would, we might connect another banking institution to, to do these payments. As we are currently sort of operating out of two. Two bank accounts. Not got you guns to banking facilities or institutions, but initially we'd like to have like an ongoing sort of accounts receivable transaction sort of history that we can rely back on and see the stability there and then going forward, expand, possibly our. Our integration.
Christian Sheerer: I get you. Perfect.
Najeer Ahmed: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: Okay. I mean, and we can switch and like, you know, we can add different bank accounts if you're going to use multiple ones later on too.
alexhoehe: Right.
Christian Sheerer: We can have that open conversation with supporter or once we're at that stage with the customer success team, sort of the account management team who deals with existing customers.
alexhoehe: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: And so I can write that out for you just to have you have an email with it all listed out of like what is what's visible and it's just that one account that you select.
alexhoehe: Okay, perfect. Then. Yeah, once we have this, I think we're, we're good to start the integration to link our bank account. And once the bank account is connected, the, the sync is already there from QuickBooks, it's already integrated. So we should be able to see something.
Christian Sheerer: Did you guys.
alexhoehe: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: Were you able to see the invoices pull through already?
alexhoehe: I'm not sure actually whether we have.
Christian Sheerer: Done because it should just come automatically basically like open invoices should Come into.
alexhoehe: Okay, let me see. Ah, okay. So. So yeah, that was a question. In terms of the chart of counts is. Is being sort of this pop up windows coming up and I believe it suggests a couple of accounts to be connected. Do I understand correctly that basically this would be just our accounts receivable?
Christian Sheerer: This is the chart of accounts that you are running accounts receivable out of in QuickBooks. So this was, this is pulling from QuickBooks right.
alexhoehe: Now I understand that, that it is.
Christian Sheerer: It.
alexhoehe: It's maybe an individual naming thing and that the system would not necessarily identify the account receivable that is relevant for. For all our invoices. It's just, it was just like interesting to see that obviously it connects to QuickBooks to our QuickBooks account and it has access to all the accounts and I guess it just requires for us to pinpoint exactly which, which is a chart of account for. For our invoices.
Christian Sheerer: Right? Yeah. You mean it's. I think that's good feedback. Yeah. Like maybe, but we'd rather have the customer make that click right. Than like automatically link the one that, you know, just to avoid any issue.
alexhoehe: How was that integration with other platforms? It pulled invoices in a different way.
Jimmy Nguyen: Yeah, it was automatic. We didn't have to choose a chart of accounts.
Najeer Ahmed: But. Right, okay.
alexhoehe: It must, I mean it must be, it must be just a different sort of way of integrating things. Okay.
Najeer Ahmed: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: I mean I think the position I. I would hazard to guess is like we want. If there's an error, I guess we, you know, we want you to be able to manually just collect. Click the chart. Is your chart of accounts not popping up here the one Accounts receivable?
alexhoehe: Let me have a look. I think it is there. I was just wondering. There is a selection. There is not a full account chart of accounts. That's why I was wondering how, how these accounts are being selected because they're only like about maybe it's limited to 15 or so to be. To be displayed. I think it's like maybe 12 or so. Let me just have a look here.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, I see 19.
alexhoehe: Actually I think I don't see it here. So if it's not being displayed here.
Christian Sheerer: Do you mind sharing your screen? Is it. It's not income receivable.
Jimmy Nguyen: You have to join the zoom on.
Christian Sheerer: Your device to be able to share your screens.
Jimmy Nguyen: Give Alex one moment. He's going to join the call on his device so he can share his QuickBooks screen.
Najeer Ahmed: Cool.
alexhoehe: Hello.
Jimmy Nguyen: So sorry about that. We're about to get that screen share up and then we're. I'm going to drop out of the call so we can speak through Alex's device.
Najeer Ahmed: Okay.
Jimmy Nguyen: Are you able to see his screen now?
Najeer Ahmed: Yeah.
Jimmy Nguyen: Okay, I'll be dropping out of this call.
Najeer Ahmed: We'll.
Jimmy Nguyen: We'll be speaking through Alex device.
Christian Sheerer: Cool. If you want to unmute.
alexhoehe: Oh, cool. Can you hear me now?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, yeah.
alexhoehe: Do you see my. My screen now?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah.
alexhoehe: Okay, so. So these accounts here is not the one that we require on the chart of cons we would require to see accounts receivable.
Najeer Ahmed: Okay.
alexhoehe: Is there. Is there some way to see additional chart of accounts?
Christian Sheerer: Can you go back. Can you go back into QuickBooks? So these are. Okay. This is the only two. Did you. You linked up with this. Do you have multiple QuickBooks instances?
alexhoehe: Yes, but that will be for different entities.
Christian Sheerer: Did you. Maybe. I'm gonna ask Najeer, who helps manage the QuickBooks integration, to come on and see if he can't. We can't figure this out. No, no. Did you link the right sort of QuickBooks instance? There was. There might be, like, a breakdown of different QuickBooks instances that you could link because it looks like there's only two charts of accounts here, and on the other one there's 19.
alexhoehe: Okay. It. Well, the integration I have not done. It was our CFO who did the.
Christian Sheerer: Okay.
alexhoehe: Because the admin is only our owner.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah.
alexhoehe: And only our CFO has access to that account.
Christian Sheerer: So. So yeah. Yeah. Just to fill Najee in, if you want to go back to nickel, actually, that'd be useful. So, Najeer, I guess just take note on that. The quickbook side, there was only two charts of accounts, but when they linked up their quickbooks here, they're not seeing the one that's titled Accounts Receivable only Income receivable, and they're getting 19 chart of accounts. So my guess was that whoever Linked up the QuickBooks account admin. Linked up a different QuickBooks instance, maybe.
Najeer Ahmed: Yeah, it might. To do with the permissions, it would be best if the person that has access to all the chart of accounts logs in. I think we might have to. Let me just take a look at the account here.
alexhoehe: But it has an account correct for the entire.
Najeer Ahmed: Yes, it should be the admin account. Thank you. Oh, I see. I think part of the reason is we don't have your payout method set up yet.
alexhoehe: Okay.
Najeer Ahmed: And so for the chart of accounts that you're seeing on the invoices, page one that you're seeing right now, this.
Christian Sheerer: Would be.
Najeer Ahmed: One second, which. Okay. I See, there's nothing you haven't yet linked a payment method or a payout method. Is that correct? It doesn't look like there's any bank account.
alexhoehe: Correct. Yes, there's no.
Najeer Ahmed: Okay. Okay. Yeah. So for now I think you can actually. This shouldn't be showing up for you. We'll change that. But you can click out of this. And then once you link your bank account, you should be able to see the credit accounts.
alexhoehe: Okay. All right, so once. Once. We are setting up our bank connection here. Linking our.
Najeer Ahmed: So right now, I guess. Were you the person who logged into the QuickBooks account?
alexhoehe: You mean like here to. To check what kind of account needs.
Najeer Ahmed: To be visible or just on nickel? Actually, when they logged into.
alexhoehe: That was our cfo. He connected.
Najeer Ahmed: He's the admin on the account. Is that right?
alexhoehe: He has access to the admin account? Yes.
Najeer Ahmed: Okay, I got it. And then you were expecting to see the accounts receivable chart of accounts, is that correct?
alexhoehe: I'm not sure what I should be expecting to see, but. But I guess, I guess in terms of to be able to pull in invoices, it seems to be that Nickel is using chart of accounts to pull in the invoices.
Najeer Ahmed: Let me just double check that for you. And would you know when you made your QuickBooks account?
alexhoehe: Sorry, you're asking when the QuickBooks account of seagenics was logged in with Intuit?
Najeer Ahmed: Yes, with Nickel. With Nickel.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah.
alexhoehe: The integration, the connection. I believe it was yesterday. Yesterday. Sometime around 4pm Mountain time.
Najeer Ahmed: Thank you. Okay, let's see here. Oh, I see you haven't. Okay. Yeah, I know what's going on.
alexhoehe: The.
Najeer Ahmed: So you go to the get paid page or on this sidebar. I'm sorry, on the sidebar, get paid. And if we exit out of this pop up for now. This should pop up here. And if you click on Set up Payments. Oh, in the middle of the screen, sorry. Go back to active Set Up Payments and then if you just select a sub domain. So what this is is basically the URL that your customers will be able to visit to pay you. So do you want it to be Surge Next or do you want it to be Surge Next llc?
alexhoehe: I guess surgenics would be. Would be great.
Najeer Ahmed: Surgenics.
alexhoehe: Great.
Najeer Ahmed: Okay. And then you can scroll down and skip these two points and click Complete Setup. Great. And now you can see your invoices here.
alexhoehe: Okay, perfect.
Najeer Ahmed: Yeah. And so this is kind of where you would request payments and things like that on your invoices. Yes. And so, and just for future Reference for the chart of accounts. When you link your bank account, you just want to select a chart of accounts that corresponds to that specific bank account. Does that make sense?
alexhoehe: Okay, we have not added this account to our QuickBooks account because.
Najeer Ahmed: I see. I see. Well, actually, I guess.
Christian Sheerer: Do you.
Najeer Ahmed: When you. So when we send over a payment, we basically need to tag it against the chart of account. I'm not sure how you guys do the transactions on QuickBooks, but typically we just have people select the chart of account that corresponds to the bank account.
alexhoehe: Right. The chart of accounts that corresponds to the bank account. Well, I mean, as mentioned earlier to Christian, we move those funds, incoming funds, over to our main operating account, which are then being imported to our QuickBooks. And then.
Najeer Ahmed: Okay, well, okay, in that case, if you want to just kind of like, skip that next step of. Basically, you don't want to show in QuickBooks the movement of funds from your sweep account to your operating account. Right. So I would suggest just when you. When you link your payout method, select the operating account as the chart of accounts. Does that make sense? That way, when we push the payment, it'll directly tag it to the operating account.
alexhoehe: You mean like when we move the funds over from the sweep account to the operating account that it will pick up from the operating account those funds that are being received, but that would be only shown as a. Without the information that is being submitted through nickel or a processor.
Najeer Ahmed: So when you. When you do your reconciliation, do you. Do you in QuickBooks kind of have a record of moving the funds from your SIP account to your operating account?
alexhoehe: Correct. Yes. And you do? Yeah. Customer service team is sort of in contact with us. We sort of manually inform them what through the. Well, we indicate in the transfer detail or transfer memo which customer that is. And. And cut. Our. Our accounts receivable team will then connect those payments to the relevant open invoice.
Najeer Ahmed: Okay. So what we could do with nickel is actually automate part of that where when the. When a payment is made to a QuickBooks Connected Invoice, we automatically update the invoice status to paid and we attach a payment through that invoice, if that makes sense. But in your case, because you're doing the Sweep account kind of workflow. Yeah. It might be better to create a chart of account specifically for the sweep account. And that way it's cleaner so that we know that you know the funds that the payment has actually been made to that sweep account. Right. And so we actually just want to make sure that that's properly recorded. In QuickBooks because we're automating this kind of like tying the payment to the invoice step. Does that make sense?
alexhoehe: Yeah, I would have to check whether we can change our operating structure this way.
Najeer Ahmed: The other option actually, and just to get ahead of it, is we cannot have that happen. We can basically turn that off for you. So if you don't want the payments to sync automatically and you'd rather manually reconcile that, that's also an option.
alexhoehe: Yeah, I mean, I, I do like the fact that we have automatic reconciliation, which would help a lot. And, and, and sort of the payment recognition would be linked to the invoice number. So it would be. Even if we would have like several customers with the same, let's say, $5,000 invoice, we would be automatically attaching or Nickel would automatically attaching the payment towards the particular invoice of that particular 5000$.
Najeer Ahmed: Exactly.
alexhoehe: Customer.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah.
alexhoehe: I mean, I need to check whether it makes sense for us to connect our operating account to Nickel or whether we're going to connect our Sweep account and add our Sweep account to our QuickBooks account. I understand that this, these are the two options that we currently have to, to make this working because having only our Sweep account connected to Nickel and then, and then not connecting it to, to QuickBooks is going to make it not necessarily efficient. I mean, it would allow us. But, but eventually it will just add additional.
Najeer Ahmed: There's an extra step. Yeah, Reconciliation. Okay.
alexhoehe: All right, that's, that's a little bit of homework and good feedback to have. I need to check. I need to connect with my cfo. Understand how we want to work this out. I guess right now the easiest would be to have our 1050 account connected. However, this night might not be the, the best thing for the auditors to, to come across the way we operating since. So let me, let me have a. We might, we might be able to connect our main operating account, but I just need to clarify this and share that we're all good on this.
Najeer Ahmed: Yes.
Christian Sheerer: No, go ahead, Ninja.
Najeer Ahmed: Yeah, whatever you want to do. I'm pretty sure we can accommodate, so just feel free to come back to us with what you decide.
alexhoehe: Yeah. Okay.
Najeer Ahmed: Cool.
alexhoehe: That's that side, I think. Is there any. Anything else before. Before we can sort of move forward with, with after I sort of connected with the cfo? Is there anything else that I might need to sort of clarify or confirm with my, my cfo?
Najeer Ahmed: Are you planning on paying bills through Nickel?
alexhoehe: I. I see a possibility. To do that we'd have to Analyze how the procedure would be and, and, and whether it would make sense for us. But if, if, if that would work, there's a chance.
Najeer Ahmed: Yeah, we can cross that bridge when we get there.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah.
Najeer Ahmed: So, yeah, no worries there.
Christian Sheerer: The only other thing I was thinking of, Alex, was you had questions about Plaid and well, Najeer was actually the one who helped answer when I was like, oh, is it just the one that they link up? That's the one we'll get Plaid read access on. But we don't really advertise this, but there are. You can go through. You can. There. You know, we can request information in a different way, like sending bank statements. If there's a. But the Plaid will just be one to one to the account that links up. Right, Ninjir?
Najeer Ahmed: Correct. Okay.
alexhoehe: Right. Well, my question with connecting to Plaid would be what information is really plate going from providing the access information? And to what extent is Plaid going to run a credit check and, and, and, and what kind of information is being pulled and what information is being kept? And then again, you have, you have access through your sort of engagement with Pled to information of us. And, and it's just. I wanted to sort of clarify to what extent the login allows you to have access to information, basically.
Najeer Ahmed: Sure. So regarding the credit check, first of all, we won't run anything like that. The reason we do a flat integration is mostly just to verify the account ownership and to make sure that whoever is linking the bank account on nickel actually owns the account to prevent basically instances of fraud or account takeover. So that's why we have it as kind of a security measure in terms of like, what we are actually reading on a. From your account. The only time it really is kind of used is if you were paying a bill with a bank account, for example, we might do a balance check to see if you have enough funds in the account to pay that bill. And that's also just a measure to prevent instances where people will try to send, you know, a million dollars, for example, but they only have $1,000 in their bank account. So we just need to be able to reconcile that. Right. So that's mostly what the reason for the platform integration is really just security and fraud prevention.
alexhoehe: No, absolutely. I mean, in terms of operating and risk management. And so that's clear. It's just like, from my side, it would be good to know what information you would.
Najeer Ahmed: Okay, I see.
alexhoehe: Not necessary to, to, to. Sure, check.
Najeer Ahmed: Yeah, no problem. We would get the. Basically the information on the account owner. So name, email Address, phone number, maybe billing address, if it's on the account. And we would also get recent transaction history. So I think it's something like 100 to 200 transactions, the most recent transaction history on the account.
alexhoehe: Okay. And, and when you say account, that would be. If you link our sweep account, it would be the transactions from our sweep account. And, and, and, and that would mean basically all, all the, the payments that we have received as well as the, the transactions of transfers to our main operating account. Obviously, we don't, we don't really send out wires or payments from the Sweep account because that's purely there to receive funds, but it would not include anything of the other. Now, if you're going to connect our main operating account, it would be literally all transactions that you would. That, that we have on our main operating account.
Najeer Ahmed: Yeah, we actually just look at the recent transactions and we actually don't store any of that on nickel. Okay.
alexhoehe: Okay, great. I mean, all good information. It gives us a lot more transparency of how nickel operates. I'll check with my CFO how we're going to proceed. And if you can simply connect our, possibly our operating account. Of course, we don't have an issue with connecting our operating account. The only thing is our company as a single owner, and that makes it a little bit.
Najeer Ahmed: Got it. Yeah. You would have to log in, basically, is what you're saying. Right.
alexhoehe: Correct.
Najeer Ahmed: Now. Yeah.
alexhoehe: With regards to the bank account, I do have access to that bank account with his login details. So if I would connect would be. It would be the, the owner's login. But I just want to make sure that, that we are sort of.
Najeer Ahmed: Yeah.
alexhoehe: Operating within the right terms, of course.
Najeer Ahmed: Okay, cool.
Christian Sheerer: Cool. Okay. So, yeah, I'll, I mean, I'll summarize basically, Nadir's answers on the, on the plaid stuff for more transparency for y' all to keep written out in an email. And then do you expect that turning that conversation around today, should we set up some time for next week after we've had some time to run through some transactions, see if we need to troubleshoot anything. And also I'll add in just how you can talk to support in the case that you have kind of like a, you know, sweep account and we need to reopen that conversation. So those basically three things, with one of them being do we want to set some time up after you guys run through the first couple of transactions after you've gotten the account?
alexhoehe: We could, we could aim to reconnect like on, on Tuesday afternoon? I will try to connect with my CFO today and hopefully have an answer by the end of today. If you're gonna connect it today or on Monday, I. I can't say for sure. Okay, we want to proceed, but I just want to clarify this first and hopefully by. Well, yeah, I mean, once. Once we did the connection, we may. We might have maybe a few more questions or so how to operate it and then run a few test transactions. Beautiful.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, we can. We can. I think that's a good agenda. We can set the time Tuesday to send out those first invoices after it's been linked up.
alexhoehe: Excellent.
Christian Sheerer: Sounds good.
alexhoehe: What.
Christian Sheerer: What time Works.
alexhoehe: Quickly. Have a look at.
Christian Sheerer: I'm wide open, so anytime you say, I'll be fine. Tuesday. Okay.
alexhoehe: I might be out on. In the afternoon. Okay. Would. Would 10am Be okay?
Najeer Ahmed: Yep.
Jimmy Nguyen: I might open on that day.
alexhoehe: 10Am On Tuesday.
Christian Sheerer: 10Am Mountain. Yep.
Najeer Ahmed: Cool.
Jimmy Nguyen: Mountain standard. So 10am Mountain. Regular mountain time would be 9am for us.
Christian Sheerer: Wait, wait, isn't it. That's the one that, like, shifts back and forth sort of.
Najeer Ahmed: Right.
Jimmy Nguyen: Mount Standard doesn't switch at all. So if we wanted to do it would be 11am Mountain is the time we're thinking about.
alexhoehe: Oh, okay.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, Okay. I think we're on Mountain standard right now.
Jimmy Nguyen: What time is it for you right now?
Christian Sheerer: It's 108.
Jimmy Nguyen: That's Mountain Mountain Time. Mountain standard is 1208.
Najeer Ahmed: Damn.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, okay, okay. Give me. Give me five minutes to get my head wrapped around the. The time zone. Wait, so it'll be. I guess if I'm looking at my calendar right now. So you're saying 10 is 9? Essentially, yeah. Okay.
Jimmy Nguyen: If we wanted to schedule it for 10 o' clock mountain standard time, we would be scheduling it for 11 o' clock mountain time.
Najeer Ahmed: Okay.
alexhoehe: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: Jesus.
Najeer Ahmed: All righty.
Christian Sheerer: Cool.
alexhoehe: Which we're in.
Christian Sheerer: We're. We're in Mexico City, so.
alexhoehe: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Najeer Ahmed: All right.
Christian Sheerer: I mean, we're usually in New York. We're going back tomorrow. Cool. I just sent that up, that invite. And I'll summarize kind of more, you know, for full transparency, the plot stuff. And then I'll just keep an eye out on operating or sweep and. And I'll CC and support and I mean, I'll be next to Najeer, so if you have questions, send it to me and we can. We can put our heads to it and then we'll get back together on Tuesday. We'll run those first transactions once you guys have had time to link everything and field any other questions.
alexhoehe: Excellent. Perfect. Thank you so much for your time. We will have our couple of things to do with the integration and hopefully we have a couple of questions, but not to too complicated ones. And we'll take it there on Tuesday then.
Christian Sheerer: Awesome. Yeah, no, we're really excited. I mean, at the risk of sounding too excited, like, we're happy to get this going. So thank you for being flexible too, on this today.
Najeer Ahmed: Yep.
alexhoehe: Perfect. Thank you so much for your time.
Najeer Ahmed: Yep.
Christian Sheerer: Have a good one.
Najeer Ahmed: Thanks, guys. Yep.
