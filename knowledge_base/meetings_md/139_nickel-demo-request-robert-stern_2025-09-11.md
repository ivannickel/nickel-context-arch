bob: Jacob, are you there?
Jacob Greenberg: Hey, Bob, can you hear me okay?
bob: I can.
Jacob Greenberg: Awesome. All right, great. I'm happy we can make some time to connect today. I have a half an hour on our calendar here. Does that still work for you?
bob: No, it works.
Jacob Greenberg: Fantastic. All right, cool. Bob, tell me a little bit about your company and kind of how you came to find nickel, what you're looking for, and I'll cut to customize our demo today based on what you're looking to accomplish.
bob: Yeah, I'm a reasonably sophisticated user. So we've been on QuickBooks desktop for a long time. Finally migrated over to QuickBooks online. And those guys are just crazy. I think they went from two dollars It started at 50 cents and it went to buck, then it went to two bucks per transaction. That went on online, they want 1%. Yeah. At one point they wanted 1% cap at 10, they've taken the $10 cap off. We bill about $6 million a year. So that's a significant amount of money.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, definitely.
bob: So what I'm looking for is QuickBooks online integration. And the first question I have right off the bat is, I want to see how the interfaces go to send an invoice and to receive. And does it update my accounts receivable in QuickBooks?
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, it does. [No backproacT] We have a two-way QuickBooks integration for QuickBooks Online right now. We're not currently supporting QuickBooks desktop or enterprise, so I'm happy that you made that migration. But it's a two way sync. So whatever activity you do within Nickel or do within QuickBooks, it'll automatically sync with each other. I'll show you a visual of what that looks like on the Nickel side. But that just means if you do like creating your invoices within QuickBooks, because you're accustomed to that now, once you do that process, it'll automatically populate Nickel and you just send it out from Nickel for payment. And whenever that payment's received, It will push that directly instantaneously into QuickBooks to keep your books up to sync.
bob: Okay, so I'm sorry, unfortunately, I may have to switch over to my phone. I guess I'm in a hotel and I don't know if the connection's that great, but I just kind of lost you on the first part about that. But basically, when you put a deposit in the checking account, you're gonna give me a deposit in QuickBooks with all the, AR information as to what invoices those apply to. Am I correct?
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, pretty much everything that you do within QuickBooks and within nickel will automatically update with each other. So there's no extra steps you need to take. I know you said you're doing about 6 million in AR a year. As far as your transaction size, what is the typical size of your transactions?
bob: I'm gonna guess maybe five or six thousand.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay. Do you ever have transactions for greater than 25,000?
bob: Very rarely. And we could break that up.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. The only reason I ask is we have Nickel Core, which is 100% free to get going, and Nickel Plus, which is just $35 a month. The two differences here is Nickel Plus can handle transactions over 25,000 per transaction. If you're doing smaller scale transactions, you could, you'll be fine with Nickel Core. The one other thing with Plus is that you have a one day faster turnaround time for deposits.
bob: So I think we'll start with Core and if we need to, we'll upgrade. If that's, yep. So tell me about the customer.
Jacob Greenberg: Bob, I think you cut out there.
bob: Experience and my customers experience. Yeah, let me try. Let me see if I've got. Yeah, I've got 5G here. I wonder if we'll keep our connection if I switch my over to my phone. Let me. Get my Wi-Fi hotspot on. Okay, that's on. And hopefully we'll keep the connection. There we go. All right, I'm going to switch over.
Jacob Greenberg: No problem.
bob: All right, connected secure.
Jacob Greenberg: Sounds good. Can you hear me all right?
bob: Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: Fantastic. Bob, just to confirm, because I have your email address here as the domain on your email address I didn't find as a website, but your company name is New Concepts and Storage. Is that accurate?
bob: Yeah, that's my personal email. I gave you not the business.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, gotcha.
bob: We'll sign up with the business email. Probably orders at email.
Jacob Greenberg: What for my records, what is your business email?
bob: My personal one. Sure.
Jacob Greenberg: Whatever you think you would sign up for, Nickle with.
bob: Oh, probably orders at, because I I'm not in the day-to-day operations. All of our bookkeeper and customer service person is orders@ncistorage.com.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. Okay, great. I saw, you know, I actually found you guys in closetinstitute.org on their website when I search up your company name. That was the first one that popped up.
bob: That's interesting. The CIA. Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: Is this like, organize? Is this like, like a group of independent closet and storage?
bob: It is. It's a trade, kind of a trade association that's only geared to Independence and keep out the franchises.
Jacob Greenberg: Interesting.
bob: So I'm a member of that. I do service some franchises, but most of my customers, so I'm an outsourced vendor for them and a lot of my clients are members of that organization.
Jacob Greenberg: Oh, interesting. Okay, cool. Is it a pretty big group of people that are part of the organization?
bob: Yeah, it's decent size. We have about 300 people and we have a meeting. It's not massive, it's a niche market, but it's a big market. It's a really big market and growing like crazy.
Jacob Greenberg: Fantastic. Well Bob, I'm gonna tell you right now that I'm gonna show you our platform. I'll walk you through it, we'll customize it for you, we'll create a rollout plan to make it easier. I think you will definitely be able to get going with Nickel Core, which is the free to start program. If you want to upgrade for one day faster turnaround times, you're more than welcome to on your end whenever you want. But we also do have a referral program. So if you do enjoy this, enjoy using nickel, we're looking to save you, you know, what, 1% of $6 million annually, I think was the number you gave me, or was it eight?
bob: I don't know if that's, Yeah, let's put this way. I wasn't going to pay that. That's what QuickBooks wanted to. It's not saving me. Right now I'm paying $2 a transaction. And so I'll be switching to 65 cents a transaction, I guess. So you're going to charge $2 per.
Jacob Greenberg: Transaction and you're using QuickBooks Pay to do it or using another third party?
bob: QuickBooks, that's on the desktop.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay.
bob: And we'd go back to the desktop if we had to pay the 1%.
Jacob Greenberg: They're making a really big push QuickBooks to get everybody onto online right now.
bob: Yeah, they are.
Jacob Greenberg: They're making it kind of hard for desktop users. Okay, so currently you're paying $2 per transaction for ACH with QuickBooks. You want to avoid having to eventually incur 1%.
bob: And the other issue we have with them is I can't send multiple invoices with a link in desktop.
Jacob Greenberg: Can't send.
bob: So we got to click on each one, send it, move on.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. What is your, yeah, so what is your ideal outcome to send multiple invoices to the same individual or to send multiple invoices at once to multiple different contacts?
bob: Multiple to multiple.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay.
bob: And the other thing is on the customer's end, QuickBooks does not have an account where they can look at all their open invoices. They only have, you know, each invoice has to be clicked on and paid so they can't open up and say, and this is what I was going to ask you about, what I'll call the customer experience, the payee experience. Can they call up their account and say, oh, there's three invoices here that I have to pay. Click, you know, pay three at once. Is that? Yep.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, great. This is great information for me to show you.
bob: And also just quick ask. I know, you know, most people prefer now to do support through chat. Or email, but if we need it to get to a point, is phone support available?
Jacob Greenberg: With Nickel, phone support is available. We're a pretty lean staff here with a really strong support and focus for our customers, so you can reach out to us via phone. I'll show you in the demo environment. 99.9% of the things that you're going to be able to have answered on the phone. Firstly, Nickel is very intuitive and easy to use. You're gonna be able to figure out most of this stuff. Once in a while, if you do have a specific question or about a specific transaction, you wanna reach out, we have a chat directly in Nickel as well. We also have a help center where we've uploaded every single answer we could possibly think of or that we provided to a customer before, just to make it easier for you. Like that would be the fastest service. But besides that, you'll definitely have access to be able to do.
bob: The other thing that was kind of a pain in the butt in QuickBooks with their billing, was if a check bounced, how did we, did I just lose you?
Jacob Greenberg: I just gotta- I'm right here, I just dropped, okay. To make the connection a little stronger.
bob: Okay, got it. Okay, yeah, and just how we would go about handling a bounce check or a return. Check or returned ACH?
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. All right, great. I'll show you that as well.
bob: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: What type of impact would it have for you when like a check would bouncer and ACH would be returned? What's the process that you would typically take?
bob: Well, we've got to go in, I think, and delete. We've got to delete the payment. We've got to delete and then rebuild the invoice, I believe. I'm trying to remember how it's done right now, but it is a pain in the butt. There's no way to just say, hey, that payment, just reverse that payment. It's pull it out, so now it's still in accounts receivable, and then usually I'll send a bill. You know, a separate invoice for the bounce back charges.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay. Give me one second here and I'm going to get my demo environment loaded for you. Okay.
bob: You mind if I ask your question while you're doing that?
Jacob Greenberg: Yep, of course.
bob: Okay. Can the customer, if the customer wants to pay by credit card, does the cut, can the customer do that and get They get the charge.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, so you can, it's kind of one of the biggest reasons why people use Nickel is that the customer, they could pass along fees to the customer in a compliant and secure way. Do you currently accept credit cards?
bob: I do. Only very few customers use it.
Jacob Greenberg: How does that process work right now?
bob: Is that also basically in our account we have set up a 3% charge, you know, upcharge to the invoice before it's billed and let customers know this. And then they just, you know, we bill them. We hit the credit card as soon as it's shipped. So. You know, it'd be nice. So we basically have locked our customers in if you're a credit card account. Your credit card account. If you're an ACH account, you're an ACH account. It'd be nice to give the customers the flexibility.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, gotcha. So typically at this point, what's happening as far as credit cards is if your customer requests it, you go into QuickBooks, you're updating your invoice to accommodate that additional charge. You're manually running the credit card on behalf of that customer that requested it and then settling it in your books
bob: on your own. Correct.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay. Got it. Yeah, this is something that's pretty common.
bob: Although we don't update the invoice. It's actually when the invoice is billed, it's in there. It's in the, like you'll add it.
Jacob Greenberg: As a line item to the invoice.
bob: Yeah, it's not a line item. It just goes right in.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. But you're adjusting the end of the invoice in order to accommodate to charge.
bob: Right.
Jacob Greenberg: Got it. Okay.
bob: Basically, everybody has a discount percentage and theirs is 3% less discount than or up to a potentially a positive discount.
Jacob Greenberg: Got it. Okay. So I'm going to show you the demo environment here. And I'll give you a little bit of background. You gave me a lot of background about your company, which I appreciate and will help me customize this so that I'm only showing you things that matter to your business. A little bit of background about Nickel is our founder started as the head of the innovation and development for Stanley Black and Decker. And initially Nickel began for the contracting and construction industry specifically. So we're backed by Stanley Black and Decker and DeWalt. And the reason why he sought to create a new tool for AR and AP is because these are typically industries that have a lot of struggle with cash flow. So it was built as a cash flow advantage tool. Very check heavy industries very often where people are driving around in their trucks for seven days with a check in it, but still need to purchase supplies for the next job. There's a lot of outstanding payments that take a long time to settle. So what we wanted to do is build a solution that made it easy to accept any type of payment from a customer in whichever way that they prefer to pay it without it taking a toll either time or financially on the business itself. So we went out to create a nickel and in doing that, we thought we should develop better payment methods and better technology than that what existed out there. So we actually were able to create a system that offers free ACH in the process where most places like QuickBooks are charging percentage or per transaction. We were able to create some technology that actually is quicker settlement times and can handle larger transactions. So I know that you're dealing with transactions under $25,000. Typically, if you were to have one individual transaction for a massive job ranging up to $2 million per transaction, we could handle that. And the way would happen is it would not be batch payments in your bank account. So sometimes with QuickBooks, if you get a 10, $15,000 payment, it'll settle in your bank account in like three or four different transaction settlements. With Nickel, it's one to one. So if you got paid a million dollars with Nickel, it'll settle in your bank account as a single million dollar transaction. This is all just to keep bookkeeping in sync. Provide a better customer experience for your customers, allow more payment types, and ultimately to have a better cash flow. So we do plan on unlocking some tools towards the end of this year to drive better cash flow management, like net terms agreements and trade credits. But for now, I'll show you a little bit about accounts receivable. So this will be your summary page here. If you had any sub companies, you'd add them here. Some people might have multiple companies that roll up into one larger enterprise. This you can keep off or you could turn on if you would like. This is a demo environment with some very light demo data. I only have a couple of different transactions in here to show you examples of, but I could show you the workflows for creating invoices and sending them to your customers, what your customers will see and how it's going to sync with QuickBooks. So this would be your transactions tab. This is more of an overview page on every transaction that you have had recently. You can filter and search in here for any, pretty much any status. So you want to look up a specific customer, specific invoice number or an ID, any date range, any size of that transaction, whether it's pending or if it's been completed, if it's been failed or canceled for whatever reason. I know that you had brought up being able to better manage returns and refunds, potential chargebacks. Those are all going to have their own categorization. And when it comes to fighting for chargebacks, we're going to support you in that process a bit. It's a very, very rare thing for chargebacks to even happen within Nickel.
bob: We never had a chargeback with other than just insufficient funds. Right.
Jacob Greenberg: Before I was working with Nick, I worked with Point of Sale.
bob: Not on my end anyway. Right. Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: This is an industry where when it comes to people that use financial solutions like this, there's a pretty significant vetting process for security's sake to make sure that there aren't going to be people who are incurring chargebacks like that. And we have a good way of managing them for you. So it's not something that comes up very often. But if there are any returns or refunds on ACH transactions, you'll be able to manage them quickly from the transaction page. Okay. Now, the first thing you're going to do when you enter your account would probably go straight into account settings once you create it. And if you wanted to, we could take a couple of minutes. At the end of the day, I'll walk you through this creating your own account because it's free to get going. But you go into the branding and upload your logo. You'd upload a banner. So this would be any image that you want associated with your company. You'd customize your company name here. This is our demo environment, so it's locked, but this would be the domain at which your invoices are going to be sent. I'll have your company name here. The first thing you'll do is come into integrations and click QuickBooks Integrations and connect your account. Once QuickBooks syncs, your very first time syncing QuickBooks is going to take about three to five minutes, depending on the amount of information you have in QuickBooks. But after your first time integrating it by clicking that button, you'll see all the data populated from QuickBooks with the QuickBooks icon right here. And every transaction that happens or interaction that you have within Nickel or within QuickBooks will automatically immediately update from one platform to the other. So it's just the first time integrating that takes a little bit of time. Now, what we're looking at here is your invoices page. So on the right hand side here, this is the get paid section. This is where you're going to live out of for accounts receivable. You can also do accounts payable out of Nickel as well. It's a very similar process. So I'll walk you through AR first. First thing I kind of want to bring your attention to is this little Easter egg. This is a payments portal. So this is the banner that I was telling you about this image. So you can upload whatever branding you want, whatever logo you want, but you can embed this directly on your website and you could customize these fields so that people can come in and enter whatever information you want them to enter on the website to be able to make an automatic payment to you. One of our older customers, been an early adopter of nickel. Is a good example of this. Chicago Brass is the company and they'll have a pay invoice button just embedded on their website. When you're done paying your invoice, you can just click return and I'll go back to their website. This is more of a little Easter egg that might be helpful for you guys, but I'm going to show you what it looks like to create an invoice from here just so I can show you what it looks like to send.
bob: I'll tell you what, we 90% do not create invoices. Everything will be automated from our system. We create a CSV, it gets uploaded to QuickBooks and then we would sync.
Jacob Greenberg: Awesome. Okay, great. In that case, the invoices will populate like this. You'll see that the invoice number is going to sync with your QuickBooks invoice number as well. And then just to send the payment, we'll go in here and click request payment. I'm going to show you the create new invoice process, just not to show you how to create within QuickBooks or in Nickel, but to show you what fields are going to populate here and what your customer is going to receive once you actually do. It's also about editing. I could pop into any one of these invoices and update this transaction if I have to for whichever reason. Say you upload your documents into QuickBooks. And the QuickBooks will automatically sync it here to invoices. I can see all of my active invoices, any ones that have been completed and paid would come here and any scheduled for the future if you have net terms agreements. But I'm going to go ahead and pop into this. We can see that this hasn't been sent yet. You can see on the payment request here.
bob: Right. Can you filter by? Can you filter by hasn't been sent and then send them in mass?
Jacob Greenberg: Yep. So you just click on the payment request tab and it would filter them. And if you do multiple checks like this, you come down here and click send payment request.
bob: Beautiful. Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: So this is going to make it a lot easier for you. But I'll show you one at a time. We pop into this and you can see the transaction information, any invoice details. If you have line items, it'll be shown right above this section in additional details. On this example, we don't have any individual line items, just the price, but those are all shown here. The cool thing about Nickel is if you do have any attachments associated with these invoices, or if you wanted to put attachments onto the invoice before sending, you can. These can be photos of the project site, any net terms agreements that have been signed, any specific contracts you have. You can include all of that into a single living web portal for your customers, so they always have access to it. It just prevents redundant back and forth communications with multiple file types. Some people love this, some people don't use it whatsoever. It's really based on your business and your preference. Also be able to come in here and send this payment for your customers. Do you have repeat customers or most of these new customers?
bob: It's all repeat.
Jacob Greenberg: It's all repeat. Gotcha. So do you already have their banking information on file?
bob: No.
Jacob Greenberg: You send it out each time and they fill in their information.
bob: Yeah, Intuit has it. We don't.
Jacob Greenberg: Intuit has it.
bob: Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay. So if it does live in QuickBooks, it will be synced to Nickel. And if you wanted to, you could come into charge payment method and just click charge customer if they've authorized you. Otherwise, you'd send this payment link. I'm going to update this to my email so that I could show you what it looks like to receive one of these links.
bob: If I get there, that's interesting. So I've got some people that It's rare because I normally beat them up a little bit, but got a couple people we put on COD. So basically we would just basically get their banking information, put it in there, and we could say, do charge an EFT from that customer. Yeah. Is that correct? Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: And we actually have a very sleek way of requesting that from your customers, and I'll walk through with you as well. That might be beneficial to you, but I'll do that in one second here. First, I'm just going to show you what it looks like to receive an individual invoice without the auto charge. Then I'll show you what it looks like to set up auto charging instead.
bob: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: I'm going to click send link. I think I did a good job cleaning up my email, so it won't look very messy. Let's see here. So I'll get this email. It'll have your company name here and the invoice number here as the subject. Again, I'll have your company name here and your logo here. We'll say you have a new payment request. NCIS requested a payment. Here's the amount, here's the due date from NCIS, the invoice number, and any memo. So you can enter a full description of what it's for. And the invoice itself is attached or any PDF you wanted attached with that file. When you go to pay now, this is really what the web portal is going to look like. You'll see past transactions from here too. So I know this is something you requested for your customers. So you can see your previous transactions. Here we'll see a couple unpaid invoices that are overdue.
bob: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: And they'll be able to click into this and it will open a new tab and bring them to that transaction. So it'll look like another screen like this one.
bob: So you can't just say, click, click, click, pay all three of these. It's going to go individually.
Jacob Greenberg: It will go individually into a new one.
bob: But at least they can see it and click on it. They're not hunting invoices.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, they'll all be accessible from each invoice. The other thing with this is that one of the reasons why we have that step by step to pay each one individually is because you do have the ability to enable a couple of fields that aren't currently enabled here because I didn't create this within Nickel. But you can update it so that the customer can choose to, for example, edit the payment amount. Meaning if they wanted to pay $100 in credit card and the remaining 150 by bank, They have the option to pay however they want to and you'll be able to track that on your side. So again, it's about giving full optionality to your customers without creating more delay.
bob: Or.
Jacob Greenberg: Cash flow disadvantages for your business. So this is the way, speaking of which, this is the way that credit cards and banking options will be shown for AE. So your customer has the ability to pay for no fee. By ACH. They also will be presented with the option to pay by card with a 2.99% fee. So it's up to them what they want to decide. What we do here is we'll automatically include the fee and the total price so that you don't have to do any manual updating on your end to the invoices. We'll take care of that so you can just zero it out on what the customer actually owes. And what we found here is that specifically in construction and contractors, 17 to 23% of the time, their clients prefer even for large jobs where the fees are pretty significant numbers, their clients prefer to pay in credit card and accept the fee just because of cash flow advantage reasons and also because so many people have like 3% card, cashback cards these days anyway, that just gives them a couple extra days to pay on their own terms. And it is preferred by the businesses, frankly, 'cause you get it settled quicker. But yeah, you present both options to the customer and you don't lose any money on either transaction. So this is what this portal would look like.
bob: Okay, now will the customer, will it save the routing? And the bank account information.
Jacob Greenberg: Yep. So if it will save it for next time if they want to pay again next time, but that also means. Yep. It also does lead me into the pre-authorization so I could come into here for this customer, which is me, and charge payment method on file if I have their authorization, but I don't here. So if I had their information, they manually gave it to me, I could update it on my own here and upload an authorization document and then go ahead and auto charge. Otherwise, I could pop into customers. Come into me here, click on add customer and go to request information from customer.
bob: Right?
Jacob Greenberg: So. Put my email here and I'm going to send and request information. Now I have a payment authorization request. Request, this will again have your name and your logo, and it will say NCIS wants to save your payment method on file. Now this is a really quick three-step process that gives all the background about why your company is seeking to authorize, what NIC is, our SOC 2 compliance, and if they can cancel or revoke this authorization, pretty much how this works. Click Get Started, accept the terms and conditions, and then enter their information. So really quick three-step process. We even allow them just to log in with their Plaid so that they don't have to enter all their information. And once that's updated, you'll be able to see that here on the payment methods on file, and you'll be able to just come in and auto charge all your customers as well. So if you did build this into your workflow and into your process to begin with, you'd be able to have all of your invoices auto populate instead of request payment. You'd just be able to click on all of them when the date comes up and click charge and be able to charge for all your customers. So it changes a little bit about your new customer onboarding workflow, what you're requesting from them to begin with. But it does make it easy and more reliable to be able to get those payments quicker.
bob: Nice. You don't have a way of showing me what it looks like in QuickBooks, do you?
Jacob Greenberg: I don't have access to our QuickBooks account, but I can tell you that the status updates are going to be identical to what they currently are in QuickBooks. We pretty much designed Nickel around the ability to easily integrate and update to QuickBooks. So whenever something is settled currently via QuickBooks Pay, it's going to look the same way once it's settled via Nickel. There won't be any duplicates. It's a one-to-one API, so everything is going to have a transaction record that exists both within Nickel and within QuickBooks. Frankly, it's going to look pretty much.
bob: Exactly the same way it does now within QuickBooks. So, let's see, we have most of our stuff we ship and the way I upload it to QuickBooks is we do have some people that pick up and those people don't get this, but it'll have a shipping charge at a $0, quantity one and the same with a crate. Charge. And again, a zero. So the, the, the admin, once they get the, the, the shipping cost, they go to the invoice and edit it. Could they and add that? Could they go in and do that here?
Jacob Greenberg: Absolutely.
bob: Okay, let me show you that.
Jacob Greenberg: So. You could come into the invoice itself and if you click View in QuickBooks, I don't have my own login info, but this would populate it in QuickBooks to update. But if I come into Edit Invoice, hold on, I'm in the wrong view, sorry. That was locked because that one had been sent already, but this is what you'll see on the Edit Invoice page on your side. When you create a new one or you're editing an existing one, all the category and line item details that populate for you on your QuickBooks that you guys have built out will show here on this page as well. We just have some examples of some line items, but these will be yours. Whether it's the shipping charges for different types of shipment. For crate, you could come in here.
bob: But if it's already in there and it's got a zero quantity or a zero, amount. Can we update that? Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: As long as you have the QuickBooks sync toggled on, you'll be able to update it the same way. I just.
bob: Yeah, I can just come in there and put quantity three for the. For the crates.
Jacob Greenberg: That's. Yeah, that's correct.
bob: Okay, beautiful, beautiful.
Jacob Greenberg: That's, yep, that's that. I just, so the thing is this information was synced from our QuickBooks, but I have personal access to my own QuickBooks, which I probably should get a demo QuickBooks account.
bob: Well, what I'll do is I'll sign up, I'll send myself two or three invoices that, you know, are 50 cents and, and pay them and see how it comes back, you know?
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, great.
bob: And then I'll know exactly how the whole thing works.
Jacob Greenberg: Fantastic. And if you need any, if you want, we have a customer success team can walk you through the trainings too, and onboarding and integration stuff. So we can set you up with someone to walk you through that process or you can play around with it on your own a little bit. Come to us afterwards for some advanced setup stuff. Whatever you choose.
bob: Yep, that sounds good. It sounds like everything you've shown me is pretty straightforward. So like I said, it is intuitive. So you can come over to where it says payment request and click on that and it'll do it by request payment, ones that have not been sent. How do I just get up all the ones that have not been sent? Just go to the filter or?
Jacob Greenberg: Mm-.
bob: So.
Jacob Greenberg: Let'S see. Unsent invoices.
bob: There you go. And is, oh, and you've got the one at the top where you can just click them all, I guess, right there. Oh, beautiful. That's a beautiful thing.
Jacob Greenberg: I love to hear it.
bob: Love to see stuff that's intuitive.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, we figured the process was complicated enough and all the software is already, so we wanted to show how to make it easy.
bob: Yep, that's if you use these tools. You know, people don't believe that we run a 5-day accounts receivables. 'cause everything's net upon receipt. Most people get it immediately, they pay it. If you go past five days, they're on hold and they're not gonna get their next shipment. People pay us with no problem and people don't have any complaints. But this is gonna make it a little easier for the customer because a lot of them have, they're getting two, three shipments in a week. And they can now just click on one of the invoices and say, okay, I want to pay all three of. Those. And get it done.
Jacob Greenberg: So.
bob: I'm excited to just do the demo, you know, just sign up and play.
Jacob Greenberg: Well, I'm excited for you two as well. If you have any questions along the way, please don't hesitate to reach out and ask. And once you start getting going, if there's, are there, I forgot to ask, I know you have a whole, you gave me a different email address for your billing system. How many other people are typically going to be like, is this you operating the sending out the invoices or do you have other people on the team?
bob: I have one person that handles all the invoicing.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, gotcha. As you can tell with Nickel, I'm sure if they've used any software before, they'll be able to figure out Nickel very quickly on their own. However, we will be able to offer you guys an onboarding training if you want to.
bob: Okay, yeah, it shouldn't be a problem. I just add another user, right?
Jacob Greenberg: Yep, absolutely. You can add up to three individual users on your core account. You can add more if you upgrade to Plus.
bob: That would be three is fine. One's a total backup, me and the manager, the customer service rep, and then myself. I'm not in day-to-day, so.
Jacob Greenberg: Great.
bob: But I want to be able to look at stuff.
Jacob Greenberg: Perfect. All right. The one other thing that I would ask is let's just set up a follow-up. What is your timeline for getting this implemented? When do you think you'll have some transactions complete?
bob: Today is Thursday. Tomorrow.
Jacob Greenberg: No way. Okay, great.
bob: I've got a half. I've got a half million dollars in billing sitting out there.
Jacob Greenberg: Wow. Okay. Okay.
bob: Gotta get out.
Jacob Greenberg: This is an urgent project for you. Let's set time the first half of next week to do a reconnect. It could be a quick call. Whatever you need. Any support there.
bob: Question the. The different levels. Do you have a, can you call up your pricing? The different levels?
Jacob Greenberg: Yep. And I'll show you how to get to it on your own as well. I said it in a recap.
bob: So I know you got a two day fulfillment. Do you have a one day or is that a, we have the next.
Jacob Greenberg: Day for credit card, two day for AE.
bob: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: Same day processing we're working on offering towards the end of this year.
bob: Okay, and of course there's a charge for that and that's great. Let me, what I'll probably do is I'll sign up with the 35 and then if we find we don't need it, we can just change it at any time. Sign up with the Nickel Plus and then change it down to the core.
Jacob Greenberg: So you do have an option to do monthly billing or annual. So 35 a month is if you pay for the entire year up front. If you want to do monthly just to test out the faster ones, it's going to be 45 a month.
bob: Yep. Yeah. Believe it or not, that's an extra day of me testing. So it's worth it to pay $45 for one month and and just get the testing done and get these invoices out to our people.
Jacob Greenberg: That makes total sense. So let's throw some time on for early next week so that if you guys need any other assistance or you want to give me a review of how everything went, we could touch base quickly. I have some availability late in the day on Monday and mid-afternoon on Tuesday.
bob: I would probably say go Wednesday so that we can, I can get some charges out there tomorrow and pay them tomorrow and then they'll be in the account on Tuesday, right?
Jacob Greenberg: Yep.
bob: So give me till Wednesday. I'm just going to throw a couple of $1 invoices out there and pay myself.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay. Gotcha. One second here.
bob: And so they do aggregate all the payments that came in on a certain day, right?
Jacob Greenberg: Yes.
bob: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: There's just different filtering tools that you could use.
bob: I'm just thinking about when it comes into my checking account, if I get an invoice, if I send out an invoice for $100 to one customer, $200 to another customer, they both pay today. I'm getting one deposit at 300 that is going to show up in QuickBooks as one deposit with the two different payments, or is it all individual?
Jacob Greenberg: I'm sorry, can you repeat that one more time? I'm just trying to follow.
bob: Okay, I have two customers that pay today, one for $100, one for $200. Yep. The payment is going to be a $300. I mean, the deposit is going to be a $300 deposit. Well.
Jacob Greenberg: If their individual customer is paying individual invoices, individual deposits on your bank side from each of those customers.
bob: That's gonna, well, I mean, it's just a lot of transactions, but that's okay. That's fine. Okay, I just wanna know how to expect. I guess it makes it a lot easier for the deposit when it comes into QuickBooks.
Jacob Greenberg: It's a little bit easier for your reconciliation process. That's why we designed it that way.
bob: Okay. Well, that's the.
Jacob Greenberg: And we're also, Bob, we are, like our development team is incredibly receptive to feedback. We've had features pitched to us from customers we've worked with for a couple months, but really enjoyed the product and were vocal about it. And we turned around the next week and built a tool. So I can't promise we're going to do that every time, but it seems like you have some specific use cases and we'll probably have some pretty good ideas. I would strongly encourage you to keep note of them and share them with me when you do. We would very much appreciate that.
bob: Absolutely. I'm developing software myself, so I'm not a programmer, but I pretend to be one.
Jacob Greenberg: Awesome. Well, we have programmers to help you. Pretend to be one better. That's how I feel here also.
bob: Yeah. Out of sheer demand, I had to write my own cam package where we, and it runs our whole business where we bring in orders from our customers and we split everything up to go to the drawer box manufacturing area, the hardware area, and then we write the code that that generates the code for the CNC machines.
Jacob Greenberg: Oh, wow.
bob: And when it's all done, it builds it into QuickBooks.
Jacob Greenberg: Oh, that's awesome. So it's very cool solution. Yeah, I'd love to put you in touch with my team here. Let's get you going first. First steps first. Here. So I'll send an invite for us to connect on Wednesday afternoon. Does 2:00 PM Eastern work for you all right?
bob: 2 PM is two hours earlier for me is 12 o'clock yeah that's fine.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay great I have should I send the invite to the same email here bob@2zi.us yes fantastic you can send it.
bob: To Bob@ncistorage doesn't make a difference either one of those comes to the same.
Jacob Greenberg: Account just forward it in Bob@ncistorage.com. Fantastic.
bob: If you want to keep it all with the company.
Jacob Greenberg: Might be a little bit easier that way.
bob: Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: All right, great.
bob: I'll be signing up with orders@ncistorage.com. Perfect.
Jacob Greenberg: Saving that now and shooting you over.
bob: A.
Jacob Greenberg: Email with a calendar invite for 2 p.m. Eastern on Wednesday, September the 17th.
bob: And just so I know, if we don't request the customer information, we don't have it on our machine anywhere, right? Correct.
Jacob Greenberg: And you're not going to be responsible for the compliance of collecting and gathering that customer information. It's living on Nickel through that platform. You can access it through Nickel, but we will be responsible for SOC 2 compliance and PCI compliance on your behalf.
bob: Okay. Yeah, I just, I have had issues before and with this system without bringing in, you know, other than right now we have customers credit cards and I prefer not to have that in our systems and, you know, it'd be great if, you know, we're totally disconnected from any of the account numbers and.
Jacob Greenberg: Yep, yep. That that's exactly the way it'll be set up.
bob: Super.
Jacob Greenberg: Very cool. All right, Bob, I'm excited for you to get going and I do want to say if it's all right with you, If everything starts going smoothly for you guys next Wednesday, I think I'd love to keep this relationship open in line of communication, ultimately to get some product feedback from you over the next couple months, but also potentially to get you to refer some other people that I know you work with at Closet Institute of America. If we're a good fit for you guys, we're probably going to be a good fit for other people there. And we have a $250 referral bonus that for whoever you get to sign up, that will go straight to you. So I know you said you have about 300 people in that organization. Could be a good little Christmas bonus.
bob: Yeah, I can push it out to my customers as well. I mean, they're billing end users. And. This may be an easy way to do it.
Jacob Greenberg: Fantastic. Just let me know when you do make a referral to us so that I can track it. For you and make sure it's logged on our back end and introductions if you'd like to via email.
bob: Do you have anything where I can send? Is there any incentive where it's like, or an email I can send and introduce somebody and then if they sign up there, they're credited to me.
Jacob Greenberg: So we do have a referral code within your account. You'll see a button that says, refer somebody to Nickel. And I'll give you a link that you could send to them.
bob: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: But I could also, if you want some materials, so you could email it to them, that'd be great as well.
bob: Okay. Yeah, I think if it works for us, then, you know, that's kind of one of the people don't realize that in my business, that's one of the things I do. We have a lot of small businesses, so I'm basically a business coach.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, got it.
bob: So, you know, I can refer people if it's working for me, you know, and it's efficient for me, then it's going to be efficient for them as well.
Jacob Greenberg: Nice. Yeah. So what I think I would do with you at that point is if you do think you're going to like it, I'll set up like a, do you use Gmail, Bob?
bob: No, I do not.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay. Well, we can set up an email template. I asked Gmail because I could share one with you if you had it. But we can set up an email template. I'll give you some of the documents.
bob: That.
Jacob Greenberg: Are easy to review and we can include your referral link in the email template and you can CC me in it so that every time you send it out, it has all the information, the link to get going and I'll be tagged so I can make sure that your account is tagged for referral as well.
bob: Okay, well, thank you very much.
Jacob Greenberg: Perfect. All right, Bob, have a great weekend. Let me know how it goes if you have any questions before next Wednesday. And other than that, I'll talk to you on Wednesday.
bob: Thank you very much.
Jacob Greenberg: All right. Have a great day.
bob: Bye bye.
