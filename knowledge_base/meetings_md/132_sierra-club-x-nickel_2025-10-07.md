Matt G: Hi.
Jacob Greenberg: Oh, I was muted. Hey, Matt, how's it going?
Matt G: Very well. How are you?
Jacob Greenberg: All is well. Busy day today. I know. We invited a couple other people to join. Do you know if it, if they're going to hop on or get started?
Matt G: Yeah, it's just us.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, great. Okay, cool. So I'm happy we can make some time today. I actually have like an hour set out for us on the calendar today. I don't think it'll take that long, but. Yeah, I just really wanted to connect, see if we could get you guys going. I know that the big hiccup in getting started beforehand was the ownership information and we're set up in this league to like set beneficial ownership for for profit companies. You guys are non profit, so ran into it.
Matt G: Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: So I want to see what we can do to resolve that today. And then after that I can hop into a demo environment and see how you guys are operating, how you want to use nickel and I'll show you how it might be able to work for you guys.
Matt G: Yeah, I mean the primary precursor right before any of this is like it, it's can we use it? Right. Can we get over that hurdle? If we can't, it's mooted. If we can, it's not. So that's going to be the, the thing is just solving this, you know, beneficial ownership question and how we want to do that. I mean, otherwise, I'll tell you exactly what I use. We're not going to accept payments through nickel. Be exceedingly rare, if not a never. What we would do is just use it to do outbound ACHs from our bank account because our bank doesn't really. It costs a lot to do. Ach. We have to pay a monthly fee because they're living in the dark ages. It is what it is. So that's the, that's the plan.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, cool. Yeah, so we'll, we'll work. We'll make sure that you guys have access to the platform, like no matter what. You know, I've informed my director here that you guys want to sign up as our teaser platform. We're excited to work with you. So we'll make sure that we can get you guys going. One thing that he said and I wanted to run it by you is if we, we could collect any director information instead. Maybe it's just for the chapter for the organization at large in lieu of like beneficial ownership, just to like verify that. We need something to verify that's not a fraudulent sign.
Matt G: Yeah, I mean if y' all are okay with the legal risk of that. Right. I mean, like, if you're doing compliance and you have a director of chapter, which is not a director of the entity which we are incorporated under, which is California Corporation, and you have someone who's bears no, you know, true legal fiscal responsibility, fiduciary responsibility, because they're not a board member of the California Corporation, like, that's fine, but that's the. I mean, you all would be telling us to do something that would be potentially legally non compliant. So that's on. On y' all as much as it is on us.
Jacob Greenberg: I think that it would work with the director of the chapter. If you're going to be using it specifically for that chapter. I could double check and make sure.
Matt G: But I mean, I generally agree with that. But I'm just saying, like, I mean, I think, you know, someone, if they wanted to be persnickety, could. I could give a rat's ass. Like, I think, I mean, I would just be great. Like it'd be great to have it set up. So I thought about doing that, but.
Jacob Greenberg: I am, I am not.
Matt G: Our EIN is theirs. That's the problem. It's not ours because we're a federated entity and thusly we use an EIN of the mothership.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. That makes sense. Okay, cool. This is something that I'll. I'll double confirm. I'll make sure that I interpreted it correctly. My understanding was we could be somebody that's correlated to that, to the chapter that's going to be using it.
Matt G: That is correct. It's just the one thing is, is that that is not a ch. If it was a chapter ein.
Jacob Greenberg: Right. You're saying there's an EIN for the entire entity and you guys are not associated with the board of that EIN entity?
Matt G: I mean, yes and no. Right. This is where things get tricky. It's like we are an authorized federated member of the entity, so to speak, but the entity is a California corporation and has an ein, and we operate under that EIN as a membership organization in a chapter. So like that's, that's the challenge. It's like, I mean, if it was our EIN for the chapter, totally different.
Jacob Greenberg: And you guys don't. You guys wouldn't be using nickel to like accept donations if there's an easy way to do that? Never. How do you guys currently do that right now? Is that all through the parent? In California?
Matt G: We use a separate system. Yeah. Which is administered through that. We have a. It links to the full compliance suite.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. Okay, got it. And that doesn't take any fees, does it? Like, that's completely free. You guys aren't paying like ACF fees or credit card fees on that?
Matt G: No, there's processing fees, but they're de minimis. Like 2 to 3%, something like that. Not more than 3.
Jacob Greenberg: And on an annual basis. And I'm just trying to get an understanding. I understand that it's not something I do initially. I want to make sure I have the data here so that we can knock it out and address it if it makes sense. If it doesn't, we don't have to. For your chapter, specifically, when you're going to be using apart accounts payable or if you're taking donations, how much money are you guys typically transacting in a month or in a given month for or per annum for donations?
Matt G: Donations are irrelevant to this use case. So I'm. That's not something that we need to discuss because we're not going to accept donations through nickel. We might use it for ar. What were you saying?
Jacob Greenberg: I was just saying that I'm just personally interested in, like, how much of the donations are. If you guys are doing more than like a million or more than 2 million a year in donations for your chapter.
Matt G: Yeah, but Jacob, what I'm saying is it's not relevant to this conversation. We're going to use it for accounts payable and accounts receivable. We're not going to use it for donations. We can't.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay. That's a compliance thing.
Matt G: Among other things. Yes, but as a means for, you know, potentially accepting incoming payments or transacting via ACH or outbound wire, nickel is valuable. I mean, I use it. My accountants use it on the business side. It's just. It's fast, it's snappy, and the fees are low.
Jacob Greenberg: So your accountants already using it?
Matt G: Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: Awesome. What is. If you guys do sign up, I could get them a referral bonus. What is the firm that is using us already?
Matt G: Well, these are my accountants from my company. Not related to the entity that's we're talking about today. Sierra. Yeah. So you could give my company a referral bonus if you want.
Jacob Greenberg: What company is that?
Matt G: It's Talos Ventures, llc. I don't think I have a nickel account with you, but maybe I. Maybe I do, actually. Maybe they created one.
Jacob Greenberg: Yep. It looks like you guys do have an account here.
Matt G: Who's the authorized party on it? Is it me or is it the.
Jacob Greenberg: Account you guys signed up on your own, got activated on your own? We just have the contact email Is Paloslustro Me.
Matt G: Oh, yeah. So that's. The accountants created it. Yep. Illustro is the accounting company.
Jacob Greenberg: There you go. Okay.
Matt G: So, yeah, I mean, you can definitely, if we get set up and clear this outbound or this hurdle for ach, particularly outbound, which, to answer your previous question, is like some months. Zero. Some months, a couple thousand, sometimes less, sometimes more. But, like, it's not. It's not going to be much. I mean, it may be that if the system works really well, then I will create vendors in IT for our reimbursements and just process reimbursements out of this. It would be great. I mean, why we wanted to do it is to pay a vendor. So that's the. And I know that my accountants use it. So again, I mean, that's what it is. We might. If it's easy, then the use case will be more. But the other question I have for y' all is like, what is the fee for an outbound ach?
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah. So currently, you can check this out on our pricing page. So I'll pull up right here real quick. But the short answer is nothing. The core tenant of nickel is that the way we've built this technology, and to be fair to the customers that we work with, we're never going to charge for aca, whether it's outbound or. The caveat here is that there are transaction limits. So I know you said you're only going to do $3,000. Transaction limit is $25,000 per transaction for the free platform. Otherwise, we do have Nickel plus, which is a monthly subscription of $35.
Matt G: So that would be $25,000 per transaction, but not. So I. We could have any number of transactions at $24,999.99, but not more than that without paying a fee.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, that's correct. I mean, it would be probably a little bit annoying, but, I mean, we're.
Matt G: Not going to do that.
Jacob Greenberg: Right, but theoretically, yes. Okay.
Matt G: Yeah. I mean, we're not. We're transacting less than 25,000amonth, let alone in one single transaction.
Jacob Greenberg: And so then you also said that you would be. So that's where your vendor Pullmans for accounts, pay table and bill pay. You also said you might be doing invoicing as well, not donations, but other invoicing.
Matt G: If we are invoiced, we may do reimbursements through nickel if we can get AC bank account information and then do that rather than me sending checks.
Jacob Greenberg: Right, right. Yep. That's a good use case. Sounds good.
Matt G: Does this just only. I mean is it limited to ACH or can we also build in. Does it have wire functionality? I mean it's. Most of the time we would be doing ach. That's fine. But you know, sometimes people like a wire.
Jacob Greenberg: I'll pop in here and show you. So have you seen inside the nickel platform before?
Matt G: That's where I am right now.
Jacob Greenberg: Awesome. Okay, can you see my screen?
Matt G: I can.
Jacob Greenberg: Awesome. All right, so you go into this bill, adjust this so we can see everything. And when you go to create a new bill, you'll add one. You guys use QuickBooks there or different accounting system.
Matt G: We use QBO.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. Perfect. So we sync directly with QBO. So all payments will go directly to QBO and all invoices. If you wanted to generate an invoice from QBO or a bill pay invoice, it'll automatically be passed into nickel. The first thing you're going to do is go to account settings integrations link QuickBooks. The first time you link it, just a heads up, it might take five to six minutes depending on how much data you have. After that it's an instantaneous two way syncs. Every time you create a nickel from in nickel or if you want to create it from QuickBooks, whenever the payments get sent or settled, it'll automatically update your accounting schedule software as well.
Matt G: So can I attach this on the mixing the Sierra Club side chapter side and my business side. But it will, I mean sometimes my clients want to pay me using their accounting system. But we could append the nickel link into it into my invoice. Great.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, I'll have links do that. So each transaction will have its own link for the invoice. And then we also have like I'll show you if you wanted to accept payments, I have an Easter egg that might be interesting for you guys in the future, but for now you would go into create a new invoice now or create a new bill. You can do recurring bills. If you do have recurring amounts on the same month, the same vendor, or you do one off, simply enter the amount. The invoice number will be auto generated if you you create it from QuickBooks or you can manually create it within nickel. You could update this with any documentation that you want so that they receive certain PDFs with that payment so that all your communications are consolidated with your vendors. And let's see, I'm going to actually create a new vendor here and what you could do is you could enter the information yourself or you could Send a request to that vendor to fill out that information. You can schedule in advance as well if you would like to. So you'll set the date for when you want the money withdrawed. If you have that vendor information and you just want to automatically send it, you can set the date in advance to schedule the payment. And you can set it to do direct ACH or send a check. You can also, on your account setup, you can add wire as an option if you just want to do a wire. But typically people do wires because they think it's a little easier, more secure than ACH ACH is with nickel, just as fast as possible, secure and free. So most people who do bill pay on that will end up using instead of wire transfer. But it is an option. You just click review and pay when you're done. I'm not going to actually send any money during this demo. But then once you send that bill pay, it'll populate here inside bills. You'll see if the payment has been made, what the due dates are, and once it's been paid, it'll move into the paid in full section. If you're scheduling it in advance, it'll be pending here on the queue for payment. But once it's complete, it'll go into paid in full. You can also set up, if you'd like, some manager approvals. So on Nickel Core, you can sign up three different accounts or three different logins to an individual account. You can, from the settings tab here, customize which members have which permissions. So you could have people inside your organization if you would like to send up certain bills and then have a manager be able to approve or deny them before that due date if you want to totally customizable.
Matt G: That is helpful. So in our case, you know, we have, you know, so David, for example, who's our chapter director, me, as the treasurer, we would set us up so everyone has that and we could create an approval for a flow, for example.
Jacob Greenberg: Yep, exactly. If you wanted to sign up more, there are some other benefits here to the pro plan or the plus plan. Excuse me. So if you're scheduling the payments in advance, you'd want to use Nickel plus. Nickel plus also comes with one day faster turnaround time for ECM credit card.
Matt G: We don't necessarily need that. I mean, I think that we would just be on the zero plan. I mean for, for what we're doing. If we were doing volume, maybe, but I, I think that that's where we would generally be.
Jacob Greenberg: And the other component here would be unlimited Active users. So if you wanted to add more than three active users, you would upgrade to Mix Plus.
Matt G: Awesome.
Jacob Greenberg: Now, one cool thing that I did want to show you, if you did want to receive payments, if there is a compliance issue, I'm not sure. It seems like it's a whole bag of worms, can of worms. But I want to walk you through this just to give it to you as an option. We're willing to work together. We're stock compliant. We're directly insured by the fds. See, I'm sure that we can coordinate to do any type of compliance you guys want to do. A lot of the customers that we have will put this payment portal directly embedded on their website. Like, for example, set up these guys the other day. They have a payment stub right here and it goes to this generic form with a brand logo, etc. It's very customizable. They could change this form to whatever they want the fields to be. You could upload images, but whatever request for certain information from whoever's sending you money. And it can say crdc your logo and any type of information. And your donors or whoever is making a payment would be able to choose whether they would like to pay for free via ACH or via credit card. And they would accept the 2.9% charge if they would like to. And I know that if you guys are doing, you know, a couple million dollars a year, that's if you do $4 million a year in donations, you're paying $120,000 probably in fees, which is a tremendous amount of money for nonprofits. So I just figured it's something I can put in your back pocket to think about if you do want to evaluate other things for invoicing or for collecting donations.
Matt G: Yeah, I mean, it's helpful to know it's definitely back pocket as you've identified. But I appreciate the overview on it. I would say we're. It's. It's very unlikely to happen. And so I don't want you to have any thought or belief that. That we were there. It's just we're. Whether or not we would do it and whether or not we can do it are both. The answer is probably no to both. Certainly know at this point in time and for any foreseeable future, for sure.
Jacob Greenberg: I just wanted to raise it. You seem like you're knowledgeable about what's going on. If this. If you guys have the same system across the entire Sierra Club, and I understand you're just in an individual chapter. I mean, I'M estimating you guys are paying between 2.2 and $4.2 million per year in processing fees, whether it's ACH or credit card, which is again, so that's an easy solve for a lot of money I'm not putting in the back pocket. If there's a way to escalate that up or put a test run into place, love to help support it.
Matt G: I mean, sure, yes. And also my tolerance for navigating that particular thing may be exhausted in the first moment. So nevertheless, it's helpful to know. But I. I would advise against believing that there would be any movement. There could be copy.
Jacob Greenberg: Well, in this case it seems like it's going to be a pretty self serve motion for you guys to get up and running. Yes. I'll coordinate with my team to understand a little bit more of information we're going to need to request from you guys for your doctor. I'll send you an email with that specific request for. Yeah, the type of stuff we'll need for, you know, director level information.
Matt G: And we can try to figure that out too from you know, the mothership and see if they have it. I mean, I don't know how they are doing beneficial information. I mean, obviously we existed as an entity prior to modern requirements for beneficial ownership. And I don't know generally how nonprofits are doing that. I mean, so it is what it is, but it would be helpful. I mean, ideally. Right. Like we have clarity as to how this works and then we're able to get set up so we can link the bank account and start doing generally outbound ACHs. I mean that's going to be the. That's, that's 99.98 of the use case.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, great. And you said those outbound Schus are going to be like 6,000 total a month.
Matt G: They're gonna. Yeah. I mean if that. Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay. It's very minimal. All right, great. Let me see what we can do. I set up and I'll email you that information specifically.
Matt G: Super.
Jacob Greenberg: Today for you.
Matt G: Yeah, that'd be awesome. And I mean, happy to try to figure it out too. And maybe I can get some clarity on the other side. It's just, it's far cheaper for us to do it this way and far faster than to do it through the bank. And the bank's ACH portal is crap.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah.
Matt G: So yeah, it'd be awesome. Let me know. And otherwise I super appreciate it. I mean, I think, and I don't mean to be cold on the other things. I just like I want to be very matter of fact of like what. Because I don't want you to waste your time.
Jacob Greenberg: I totally understand. And so I'll give you some background as to why I keep bringing it up. Typically nickel is originally built for kind of like the industrial built world segment. And so it was a. There's a big cash flow problem with the contracting industry and that's why we developed nickel to be able to do free ach and provide optionality and freedom to customers and businesses. But because of that we're really built to manage a certain volume of transactions per customer and like our Rails are supporting those specifically. So in most instances, just to be completely upfront and transparent with you, Matt, if I had in had an inbound demo request for a user who is only processing maybe $60,000 per year, I would say that this is not really something that. That we can actually support. However, because you guys are part of a larger organization and because I reached out to you guys just to make sure everything to get set up, I want to make sure that we do get you guys set up and that we do support you. It will take a slightly little bit more lift on the back end once you guys start processing for our development teams and for our onboarding teams. But because I initiated it, it's only fair for me to be able to support you guys. But that's the reason why I keep asking is if we can know sustain this relationship on a larger scale. That's one other way we can justify a longer partnership with the entire organization.
Matt G: I understand it's advantageous for y' all to have the Sierra Club and the in the list. I just. I. And. And that is something that I'm. It is clear to me because it is obvious, but it is also right. Like I do not make decisions for a vast organization that moves slower than the Titanic. Avoiding an ice.
Jacob Greenberg: My. My entire life has been hearing the frustrations around working for nonprofits. My mom was director of developments for many nonprofits my entire life. And I'm super familiar with the, you know, how slow it moves. So you know how it goes.
Matt G: I mean we move fast, right? Our chapter moves fast. So anyway, it's all. It's all good. Let me know. I mean if, if it works great. But it's also right. Like if we aren't the right partner for you, then that's also a very fine thing to say because one of the things that I'm least interested in in this world is wasting people's time, including yours and including that of your Company.
Jacob Greenberg: Insane. And I wouldn't have had this conversation if I didn't think potentially fruitful. Let me talk internally today. Identify. This is something we can support. I'm pretty sure we'll be able to help. I will be really efficient in my response. And I understand that perfecting up the ladder with Sierra is not something that you'd want to champion, but if there is somebody that I would be able to just talk to on my own and not waste your time during that process, it'd be super for me to be able to.
Matt G: I never suggested it would be a waste of my time, only that it would be a Sisyphean effort.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, got it. And those are not the same.
Matt G: Well, it depends on how you view your Greek mythology. Sisyphus was punished and the punishment was to roll a stone up a hill only to barely reach the top and have it roll back down. But what do you think about Sisyphus's worldview is the second question. I mean, if in one scenario he's upset that he has to keep rolling the stone up the hill only to have it rolled down again, that is in fact a punishment. But I might allege he's in on the joke. Right. And by that I mean he knows that he has to do it. It's joyless. It's futile. It is, in fact actually Sisyphean. But, like, if you embrace that for all of its, you know, repetitive frustration, maybe it can ultimately not be joyless. So maybe he's smiling, maybe he's grinning. Maybe he knows that it is what it is and the world is what it is and, you know, gotta keep rolling the stone up the hill. I don't know.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah. And then it's no longer a punishment.
Matt G: Yeah. Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: Well, if. If we were to proceed in that area. All I'm saying is I would be happy to. If you wanted to connect me with somebody who I would take the burden of the Sisyphean task and just, you know, ask them some questions and see if they could pitch using nickel cross organization. I do think that it would probably save millions of dollars for Sierra Club annually. That's the only reason I'd be willing to have that conversation. If you want to be part of it, I appreciate it and love it, but I totally understand if it's not across your list.
Matt G: If I get a split one of the millions with you.
Jacob Greenberg: There'S probably going to be a referral fee that I could build in. I doubt it's going to be millions.
Matt G: I mean, we could take.
Jacob Greenberg: But see, that's not even close to.
Matt G: The millions that we would say. I'm joking with you now, to be clear. It would be otherwise. But nevertheless, I. I mean, I. I think. I think if. I would say the first order is, why don't we figure out how to do this for us for the purpose that we have set out, which is to do limited inbound accounts receivable and a lot more outbound accounts payable, mostly. Ach. And then if that works, it may be that our sister chapters are also looking for something similar. And if we're able to say, here is something that's working for us, then that's far better than the hypothetical that it may or may not. So if we solve this challenge right, then we're in a better position and we can answer with certainty. When our sister units are saying, how the do we do this? We say, oh, well, we work in nickel. It's super simple, and we just pay people that way. And it's far cheaper than, you know, paying our bank to do whatever. I mean, and I don't know. I make no promises. I'm not in a position to make promises. I don't like to make promises because promises can. Are often not delivered. But, like, I'm keen to work with you all to figure this out. I think it solves our problem. If it's not a waste of time for you, and it's not a waste of time for us, then let's go forward. And if. And if it does work, then we're in a position to answer a question with an emphatic yes rather than no, which is where we are right now. But we'll get to that. I think with what you've said that. That you'll do and going aground on some of these questions. So I appreciate that immensely.
Jacob Greenberg: All right, great. So let me get back to you by the end of today with some information for next steps for the BC chapter. So you guys can start doing a couple AR and a lot of great, awesome.
Matt G: Thank you very much, sir.
Jacob Greenberg: You got it. Thank you. I'll talk to you later.
Matt G: Okay, see you.
