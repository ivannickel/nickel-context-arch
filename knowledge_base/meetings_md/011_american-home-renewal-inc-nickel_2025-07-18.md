Ivan LaBianca: .
Colton O'Farrell: Hey, Ivan.
Ivan LaBianca: Hey, Colton. You mind if I just tell him that this is the first time we're doing this and we'd love his feedback on it?
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, sure.
Ivan LaBianca: I think it's a good way to do it. We'll just say that. And then it'll also explain why there's like a bunch of us on the call. Yeah. He's a business owner. I think he'll like it. He'll like the concept.
Colton O'Farrell: Ray just has to be hidden, I guess, because I was, well, came from Ray, so I think he was expecting to speak with him. So, well, he's right here. So, I know.
Ivan LaBianca: Yeah, I'll just. I could just say that. And then mute myself and just say, yeah, we're just listening in. And I can say that Christian just joined the team.
Colton O'Farrell: No, it's not from Christian. It was from Ray.
Ivan LaBianca: Oh, but I think Christian. I think Christian might. Is he on the invite or.
Colton O'Farrell: No, no, it's something that's completely separate. I want to mention Christian. It was just Ray and me that he's. quote unquote, emailed with.
Ivan LaBianca: What'd you get in yours?
Colton O'Farrell: And he did reply last night at like 11 something and said, requested this time specifically. So I followed up, sent an email with the demo as well as the calendar invite. my cat.
Ivan LaBianca: Did you know we have two big samoyeds in this office?
Colton O'Farrell: Two? I knew about tofu. I didn't know about who's the other one's dog. Oh, it's in O'Farrell as well.
Ivan LaBianca: Yeah, O'Farrell.
Colton O'Farrell: I didn't know. I did hear him mention his dog's name was Op. I didn't realize it was the same type of dog, though. That's awesome.
Ivan LaBianca: Yeah. Ray is was dog sitting for him, and so he was saying that you get a lot of attention when you walk down the street with two big white fluffy dogs.
Colton O'Farrell: I bet. I might have to give him a call on his phone too, if he doesn't pop in here in the next minute or two, just because he did not confirm the invite, but he did reply via email last night.
Ivan LaBianca: Cool. Now let's give him like two minutes or something.
Colton O'Farrell: Like I said, I put a hold on my calendar for like till 1:45 my time or for the next 40 minutes, so.
Ivan LaBianca: . . Yeah, should we give him a call?
Colton O'Farrell: Just sending him an invite or email with a Zoom link, but yes, I'm happy to give him a call now.
Ivan LaBianca: Sure.
Colton O'Farrell: And yeah, I think you're CC'd so you probably saw that email, but I will just give them a call.
Ivan LaBianca: Good morning.
Colton O'Farrell: Good morning. Hi, this is Colton from Nickel. I have a scheduled call with Mark for this time right now. Just wondering if he was available. He replied via email pretty late last night, so just wanted to make sure he did not miss it. Thank you, all my team. Hold on. Thank you so much. Hey, you've reached the San Mateo Office of American Home Renewal. No one's available to take your call.
Ivan LaBianca: So please leave us a message and. We'Ll give you a call back as soon as possible.
Colton O'Farrell: Thanks. Hey, Mark, this is Colton from Nickel just calling regarding our demo call we have scheduled. I'll be on the Zoom invite if you want to join at any point, otherwise if we need to schedule, no worries, you can give me a call back at 605-520-9868, otherwise we can do that via email, but hope to hear from you soon. Thank you so much. All right, what are your thoughts? Let me just sit in here.
Ivan LaBianca: Let's wait a minute, see if he shows. He was responsive to the email, so I think we'll be able to get him scheduled.
Colton O'Farrell: Cool.
Ivan LaBianca: People are, a lot of these people, I don't think, take very many meetings like this, so.
Colton O'Farrell: Right. Well, we did the cold calling block a little bit earlier.
Ivan LaBianca: We got, you got, Christian's number, that fix worked.
Colton O'Farrell: I don't know if he resolved that.
Ivan LaBianca: He was, he just didn't have a seat. Jacob had the seat, so I signed it, right? Yeah.
Colton O'Farrell: It was mostly just me and Zach making some calls. I think there's some, like, the script he shared with us is pretty good. It's more like, I think we really need to start leveraging, like, the, the fraud protection, because there's so many times I've had calls with somebody where it's like, they seem like they're pretty not interested, and they're like, oh, we have, like, bigger fish to fry or bigger issues to deal with right now. And they're like, oh, we've been dealing with a ton. of check and mail fraud. And then that's like been my avenue to get back in there and get them, try to interest it. But definitely want to like try to weave that into like the pitch itself. Cause I think there's a lot of-.
Ivan LaBianca: Can you just say that again? I just unplugged my headphones. Yeah, this whole calling wholesale distributors, you say that a common thing you hear is that they don't have time to deal with this because they're dealing with check and mail fraud. Is that what you're getting on the calls?
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, I had a call today with this company called, I think it's American lock Supply or something. And she is like, they use PCN Bank and they, like, do their ACH and wire transfers and stuff. They handle the PCI compliance for cards. But she's like, yeah, yeah, they're good. We're, you know, we just have a subscription set up with them. But, yeah, she's like, you know, we're fine in these areas. I have, like, bigger issues to deal with, like. you know, fraud and stuff like that. And I was like, oh, are you experiencing a lot of check and mail fraud? And she said yes. And I was like, well, that's something else we're able to help with. We have built-in fraud protection, bank level security. I'm like, I'm happy to share some resources on that if you're interested. And she said, yeah, like, please do send that over via email.
Ivan LaBianca: I'll take a look. Interesting.
Colton O'Farrell: But this was a person who was like about ready to hang up on me too.
Ivan LaBianca: Yeah. So we need to probably have the talking points prepared for that a little better.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, definitely. Solid opportunity.
Ivan LaBianca: Ray, do you think you would, what would you do in that case? That's also kind of ridiculous. That's, she says, I don't have a problem with this. I'm dealing with bigger problems. And the bigger problems are exactly this. Yeah. So there's also a little bit of messaging on our end, too.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep. Yeah.
Ivan LaBianca: And I just saw Wheeler advertising that.
Colton O'Farrell: Inbound I had earlier today. They signed up. I think they liked their payment method already, and I just saw that there was, like, a transaction unless. that was from our side to test it. Yeah, Wheeler Advertising just received a car payment for $1.03 from...
Ivan LaBianca: But, Colton, two thoughts on going back to the whole fraud thing, right? One is the whole PCI compliance thing doesn't really matter unless they want to, unless they're saving their customers information. and auto charging their customers like same payment method. Use PCI compliance as like a strong value proposition. Even if people are having that problem, PCI compliance is rarely like, I don't know, something super top of mind. So I would only mention PCI compliance if you guys realize that the customer is saving, the merchant is saving all their customers information.
Colton O'Farrell: In this scenario, they were in there, how they're doing it is they're taking credit card payments over the phone.
Ivan LaBianca: Right.
Colton O'Farrell: And like, then they said that I think 40% of all of their customers have like some kind of payment authorization thing.
Ivan LaBianca: Yeah. Okay. Got it. And then the other thing with, so that makes sense to me then. Thanks for the context. Yeah, of course. When it comes to fraud, the kind of fraud that the things that we do with fraud, it's not It's less like a technology thing. It's less like we have bank grade security or we have PCI compliance because everyone has that, right? Their bank has that. We're not going to have better PCI compliance than their bank. What is really different is that we're changing the way that they actually process payment and how they handle all that information. That's what I will focus on instead because Nickel is essentially asking as like, a traffic between them and their customers or them as their vendors.
Colton O'Farrell: Can you give me some more context on like the vetting of vendors through Nickel? And because I know that's something like a value prop that we've leveraged before, but in terms of like, the vendors.
Ivan LaBianca: Don'T even matter, to be honest, what I typically say, like if there's check fraud happening or their checks are getting stolen, right? I would just like, I would just like specifically focus on that and talk about how the fact that if they're sending a check on Nickel, that check is tied to a nickel bank account. So even if it gets lost or it cashes it, nickel is on the hook, not them.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep. I was wondering how much of that we're supposed to share in terms of like that we have like our own bank account that has like that's where the ones, I wasn't sure if we were supposed to share that or not, but it's okay to share that and that.
Ivan LaBianca: Yeah, for sure. For sure. Like this is an actual benefit because When there's any out of check, well, when they're processing any sort of payment, regardless of the payment method, right? The whole idea is that Nickel acts as the middleman and you, your customer and your vendors don't have to exchange any sort of information with each other at all. And everything is routed securely through Nickel. That's the anti-fraud. Right.
Colton O'Farrell: No, that makes sense. And it's awesome that we can share that. And I think that's probably a pretty good sell for a lot of these people that, you know, Nickel's the one on the hook is our bank account. Like, no, that helps a lot. So thank you. Okay.
Ivan LaBianca: It looks like this guy's not going to show. I guess, you know, watch your email. We'll probably follow up again Monday.
Colton O'Farrell: I'm sure it'll happen. And I. I sent him an email already as well and left the voicemail, so.
Ivan LaBianca: Okay.
Colton O'Farrell: Wow. Ooh, I was wondering too, this came up for another client that Claudio actually said was a pretty good fit, but a couple, I think it was like July 1st, I had this call with this woman named Tina from Boundless Data. She was like vetting us on behalf and some other solutions on behalf of her client, and I found who the client was just yesterday. But one thing that was really important for them was 3D secure, and Claudio said that we could implement it pretty easy. quickly and easily. And she loved that it was just included as like part of the plan. But I'm thinking that would be really awesome too, just to leverage from like a security standpoint.
Ivan LaBianca: What is that, Ray? 3D secure? Yeah, something that protects you from chargebacks. Interesting.
Colton O'Farrell: So I can share with you what I I'll send you, Ivan, what I had talked about before that was given to me from Claudio about it.
Ivan LaBianca: Okay. Cool. Yeah, to be honest, it's getting out of my scope of what I understand about the product and risk. But this is good. I would share this stuff in the outbound channel tag. And let's say, yeah, because I can always learn from it, but it's probably useful for everyone else too. that's doing selling.
Colton O'Farrell: Right.
Ivan LaBianca: Cool.
Colton O'Farrell: All right, we'll do. Thanks for jumping on. Sorry, this guy didn't make it, but.
Ivan LaBianca: We'Ll get him in at some point. Sounds good.
Colton O'Farrell: Talk to you later. Bye-bye.
