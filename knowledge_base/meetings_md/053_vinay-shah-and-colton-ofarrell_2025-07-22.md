Colton O'Farrell: Some of the challenges you have from an AR or AP standpoint, that'd be really helpful.
vinay: Sure, sure. Yeah, so I'm the CFO treasurer for the Atimo, which is a tutoring company. My wife is the founder 15 years back. She founded the tutoring business and now we have 14 teachers and hundreds of students. So our payments, so mainly 100% what we talking is AR, you know. And so there are three ways we build them or our services are pretty much every month we charge fixed amount to the parents, usually on the first of the month. Now they start, they might join on a 15th, for example, of the month. And still from next month they will pay on the first of the month, you know, because it's the. Yeah, that makes sense on everybody, right?
Colton O'Farrell: And how are they paying you today? Or what does that process look like? So it sounds like you're doing a lot of recurring invoices of like the same amount for some of these customers.
vinay: Right. So typically, we have current processor and.
Colton O'Farrell: We... Who is the current processor you're working with?
vinay: Elevon.
Colton O'Farrell: Elevon.
vinay: Yeah.
Colton O'Farrell: Okay.
vinay: So we use them and every month. So typically how it works is that the parents, we send them the buy button, they click on that and then say 100 parents signed up that way, you know, and we typically tell them to pay token amount because the amount we may not be able to tell a friend right away because we have to see where the child will go to group class or individual class and the fee could vary. So once they do that, now we have captured the customers. Say 100 customers signed that way. Parents rather, customer, parents, customer, same thing for us, right?
Colton O'Farrell: Right. Just for them. And then being educated.
vinay: Right. So then we We download that under customer and we add the amount. We add the maybe how many installments or the period for the academic year. And we add the date of billing, usually first of the month. And then we upload it, batch upload it to the platform. And now they are set for the academic semester or the year.
Colton O'Farrell: How many children or I guess in your case, it'd be your customers, but how many are you working with on kind of an ongoing basis? I did some digging into your company and I just want to confirm if some of these numbers are correct, but it's looked like you guys were doing about 10 million for revenue. Does that sound pretty accurate?
vinay: No, no, no.
Colton O'Farrell: Is that a lot higher than what you guys are currently doing?
vinay: No, no, a lot lower. We are not.
Colton O'Farrell: Right.
vinay: We are very small business.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah.
vinay: Yeah.
Colton O'Farrell: Right.
vinay: So we are only, what, 30, 000 a month, roughly, I would say.
Colton O'Farrell: You know, 30, 000 a month is kind of what you're doing typically.
vinay: So 200 students, for example, you know, 200 parents. maybe more 250, but yeah, something like that.
Colton O'Farrell: Got it. And they pay 7 cents.
vinay: Yeah, they pay 100 to 150, maybe 200, 300, you know, depending on the class.
Colton O'Farrell: Smaller payments in the hundreds of range, typically, but it's billed every month.
vinay: Right, right, exactly.
Colton O'Farrell: And what is the shortest kind of turnaround, like the shortest working time that you would have with one of these children. Would it be like a three month time? Is it, do you ever do just one offs where you have like a one time engagement with a child or?
vinay: Yeah, we do because we don't have contracts because we believe in ourselves. So we tell them that you can discontinue anytime you want.
Colton O'Farrell: Okay.
vinay: But minimum month, you know, but typically we have 90 plus percent retained retention, so to speak. Right. So typically they stay for the at least six months, if not more. Cool. For the semester. Yes. So. But. So that's the basic idea is to so far we have not offered them option of the ACH or the ECS. electronic check or ACH, whatever you call it.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep. Are they mostly- yeah, credit card today.
vinay: Yeah, so 100% is credit card.
Colton O'Farrell: And for that credit card fee, is that the parents usually paying that or do you have to like eat the costs as a business?
vinay: Yeah, we have eaten costs for these many years, you know.
Colton O'Farrell: But you have been paying the costs?
vinay: We have been paying the costs. So now, this academic year we want to change it. That's where you come in.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, absolutely.
vinay: You know, when customer clicks on the buy button, takes to your athimom.niikkel.com or whatever the payment page, the hosting hosted by you. And then customer have two options, right? One with the 2.99 as your website says using credit card, And the other option below it, okay, if you don't want to pay fee, then just put your checking account. But our requirements remain the same as far as recurring and we having to do minimum work as far as you know. Once they sign up, if they sign up with the exact amount, then it's no brainer. But most likely they may not sign up with the exact amount. As I said, it could be there could be a period negotiating or knowing the child period or whatever, and then we finalize the fee. So we need to have ability to go back, download those 100 customer who signed up, for example, using $1 and then download the 100 customer in a Excel or CSV whatever and then upload it. to your platform.
Colton O'Farrell: What are you guys running on today for your ERP system?
vinay: I'm sorry?
Colton O'Farrell: What are you running on today for your like ERP system? Do you have like a QuickBooks?
vinay: No, no, we are Excel.
Colton O'Farrell: Just mostly Excel based. Got it.
vinay: So that's the way we do. We download the 100 customer or 200, whatever it is. and we upload and some customer will have same fees, some will have different fees, you know. So within spreadsheet, we added those amounts. We put the beginning date, end date, number of installments, and we upload and we are set for the academic year. and there are occasions where they don't want to continue or they move from say group class to individual or vice versa. We need to go back and of course change the dates or amount. And again, we try to do that using the batch upload. If there are more, if there are one or two, then yeah, of course we can click on each customer and make them those changes in their recurring profile, so to speak.
Colton O'Farrell: And Vinay, how are you paying the 14 teachers that you have underneath the company today?
vinay: Good question. So we pay most of them by Zelly.
Colton O'Farrell: By Zelly, Zell?
vinay: Yeah. And a couple of them want physical check for whatever reason. So we mail them that. So that's the way. Yeah.
Colton O'Farrell: So if you have something that's another area that you might want to think about that you could potentially work with nickel and to pay, to pay out your teachers that are underneath the company. What I've heard today, based on kind of what you guys have set up and what you're looking for, nickel is definitely a great solution and will meet your needs. It's just a question of what plan would be most applicable to you. So I'm going to go ahead and share my screen here quick. If you do have any questions as I'm Discussing, please interrupt and ask away. This is meant to be engaging, not more of just like me presenting for you. But I'm going to go ahead and just explain the pricing so that's clear. And then after that, we can jump into the demo. Okay?
vinay: Before you do that, that way it will be more productive. There are three areas. Please address them. that way. There is no confusion or that, you know, it should be Focus. Let's see. Put it that way. Right. Yeah. So three things are and looks like you, you are doing it already. But just to make sure, one is, of course, the recurring part, the easiest. It has to be batch. I don't want to go to each customer and click and then change the recurring terms, you know? that's a big no for me. The second, I don't think it's a problem for you guys is the surcharge right there. Yep. And, and with the option of the ACH or ACS right there, you know, with one button on your website, I get hosted by you guys. And, yeah, the third. thing is if I have to download, you know, the customer information, it should be Excel or something that I can.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, I'm happy to also what the great news is, I will definitely be touching on every one of those aspects there, and I will be showing you what you would see on your side as well as your customers. So you did you get kind of the full picture there. But if as I'm going through this, you're not seeing anything or you have questions, please go ahead and stop me and happy to address them as they come up.
vinay: Yeah. One more thing because it looks like you, because I have look at your website, looks like you will be able to do what I just said, you know, about those three features. Now the logical or the whatever you call it, because I have gone through with another company, Proteasa, and I want to just bring out to your attention so that you might have answered for me is that I'm a CFO, I'm a treasurer, I sign all the IRS payroll and tax and all that. Yeah, but I'm not the owner. My wife is the owner of the LLC.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep.
vinay: 100%. And I think we put a credit freeze. We had some issues. She has excellent credit, by the way. I mean, you know, but we had to. So Rotessa asked us to unfreeze on Equifax. And I know that that, you know, and the other company did not ask me to unfreeze. They approved it. I don't know whether because I put my name in as a treasurer and I put my social security number, I put her social security number in ownership. I put zero in my name and 100. And for whatever reason, they were very immediately they approved the ACH, you know, I guess because they typically may not.
Colton O'Farrell: Need the.
vinay: Credit pull, so to speak, or soft, soft pool or whatever. But looks like ACH needs that kind of ACH needs a soft pool or something, you know? So based on the ownership, it's LLC, single member.
Colton O'Farrell: That won't really matter for us. You won't have to worry about that. So, I mean, we have over 10, 000 customers that range from small Mon post style shop. all the way up to doing multi-million dollar in revenue. So like once I'll explain the pricing and once I do that, I think.
vinay: It'Ll be a good big thumbs up or big thank you because that become a little, you know, with the current processor, let me be honest, I mean, not transparent that, oh, you are running from home. I say for four years I've given you business of 360,000 you have billed me and now you are coming, oh, you are Homebase and for ASC, you know, great card, they are okay.
Colton O'Farrell: So yeah, you won't experience that with us. So I can, but that is something I've heard many a times from individuals I speak to. So I totally understand where it's coming from. I'm going to go ahead and share my screen that the pricing side of things just to talk through this. So there is one element that I wanted to discuss. So basically my role is to just equip you with the knowledge, understand your business and try to make recommendations for what would be the best use case for you. so with nickel, we have two plans that you can get set up with. So anyone who creates a nickel account, they will be automatically set up with the nickel core plan. That is our completely free plan. So there's no cost there. The only way that you would pay for a cost is if you decided to eat some of the the credit card surcharge, that 2.99% by default, 100% of that cost is going to go to your customer and I'll show you how you can manage that. on a global level as well as an individual invoice level. But what this plan does is it allows you to have three.
vinay: This is all music to me. I tell you.
Colton O'Farrell: Good, good. We're happy to hear that.
vinay: You are like, I mean, when I found you and I saw at least some, what you were telling and I said, my God, unbelievable. I didn't find you guys, you know, earlier or something. I mean, this is all so good because it fits right. And, and also the timing is perfect because for years our mindset was thought or set on oh, we have to pay the fees and this and that, you know. Yep.
Colton O'Farrell: There's another way.
vinay: As long as we give option to ACH, then we don't eat the cost. I mean, you know, then customers have a choice. Okay, don't pay cost, then do the ACH, you know? So. Absolutely.
Colton O'Farrell: Didn't mean to interrupt, but. No, no, that feedback is. That feedback is much appreciated. And, you know, we designed it to be this way. So we wanted to provide something that was of immense value to small and. to, especially to small businesses, maybe we won't make anything off of that per se. But when you have happy customers, you get referrals, you get reviews, there's kind of that network effect. They'll tell their friends, peers, and before you know it, you have customers that are happy users. And that's where we're at with Nickel today.
vinay: Absolutely, absolutely. The one thing I have, in fact, somebody I, you know, to recommend, refer already in my My wife's sister has a huge business of art classes.
Colton O'Farrell: Oh yeah, yeah.
vinay: And they use 11 because we refer them to 11. And now once I go through you guys, you know, I can definitely refer if, you know.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, and we also do have you, if you refer a business on a nickel, we'll give you a $250 like referral. Thank you. So just something to keep in mind, especially if your white is interested or your sister in law. But just to kind of explain the end of the kind of the pricing. So there are some limitations. Like I mentioned, this is designed primarily for small businesses. We allow for a lot here. So you can do transactions up to $25,000 per transaction. So that's on the ACH side. That is not cumulative, meaning you could do 100 of those. You just cannot do one at $26,000, which given your current invoice sizes shouldn't be an issue. Where there's going to be something that you'll need to make a decision on is unfortunately on the free plan, you cannot schedule payments in advance or do recurring payments. That is something that is only enabled on the Plus plan. But basically on the Plus plan, you get everything that I've discussed on the Nickel Core plan plus some additional features. So for that Plus plan, you can either do monthly billing at $45 a month, or we do have an annual plan that is $35 a month, so a 20% discount there. There are no other fees associated with this account, so there's no hidden fees unless you are deciding to pay some of the credit card surcharge from your customer. But again, I'll show you that aspect. But basically we bump up the limit from $25,000 to just under $1,000,000 per transaction. You can have unlimited users, you can do recurring payments, you can schedule payments in advance, And then we also speed up the ACH processing time. So on the free plan, it's generally two to three day turnaround time. We are still required to get those into the sponsor banks before 4:00 PM Eastern Standard Time. But as long as you do that on the free plan, it's generally a two to three day turnaround time. And on the plus plan, it's generally same day to two days.
vinay: We will not talk about free plan because we don't have recurring. So we'll just focus on the plus.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah. And so that was the main thing I wanted just to call out there.
vinay: Right, right, right. Once you told me no recurring, then it's out the door because that's the, that plan is not for us because we 100% wants to depend on the recurring, you know, if possible. I mean, there will be once in a while, there'll be one time, two time, but mostly it will be recurring, yes. So we can focus on that, yes. Cool.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, just wanted to make sure you had all your questions answered there and that was clear. So if at any point though, you do decide that you need the recurring, you can come into the plans here and you can self serve and upgrade as needed. We give all customers a 14 day free trial of the nickel plus. If you love it and want to, you know, continue on that, it would just roll over to either $45 monthly or $35 a month on the annual plan. Or you could always revert back to the nickel core plan. But really your decision there. I know you guys are operating on like spreadsheets and, and mostly Excel. But if you decided to, you know, switch to like a QuickBooks online or something, just wanted to point out that we do have a native integration there. So this is literally just you click the button once, you log into the QuickBooks site, you select your company chart of accounts, and then everything flows into Nickel from an accounts payable perspective, as well as an accounts receivable perspective. When you are integrated, anything that's done in Nickel or done in QuickBooks Online, it's going to be a real-time sync. So whatever's done in one system will reflect the other. Because you're operating on the spreadsheet side of things, When we onboard customers, we're happy to get your existing spreadsheet and upload your customers. So you'd have a list of your customers right there. All of your invoices would flow directly into here. And you don't need to create invoices from Nickel. You might want to just being that you don't have like a QuickBooks or ERP, it's mostly spreadsheet base. So in that case, it may be really beneficial for you to actually create invoices through Nickel. To do that, very easy. You just come to new invoice here, you would select your customer. So we'll say myself. We have some advanced features that you can turn on or off. So if you want to disable credit card payments for this, you can. Ooh, before I create this invoice, I did want to show you the credit card surcharge element. So when we go to the settings, get paid here, this is that credit card surcharge that I was telling you about. So By default, 100% of the accounts receivable costs of the credit card will be paid for by your customer. This is a global rule. You are able to override this at any percentage you like. So if you wanted 50/50, 25/75, or fully eat the costs, you can do so. But again, by default, 100% of your customer will pay for that credit card surcharge. When it comes to generating our new invoice, so again, I'm just going to find my name. Go to advanced, like I mentioned, you can disable credit cards if you want, you can allow the customers to edit the payment amount. Or this last option here is where we would override that global setting for credit card surcharge. So for example, typically we want 100% of that charge to be paid for by our customers if that's how they want to pay us. But maybe for this particular invoice, we're going to split it 50/50. You can go in there and override the global settings just for that.
vinay: Right, very nice. Yeah, yeah.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, so we'll just turn that off right there. But I'm going to just go ahead and call this invoice. We'll call it 133 with today's date, 22, 25. We'll have this be for $300. This will be a one time engagement. But again, if you're on the Plus plan and wanted to do recurring, you can do that there. That's every month, every week, every quarter, every year. Like I mentioned, we'll just keep that on one time. If you have any kind of invoices that you want to upload.
vinay: Keep it recurring. Sorry. Keep it recurring.
Colton O'Farrell: You want to do a recurring? Yeah, yeah. So we'll have this be every month. We'll have it be on, yeah, we'll just have it be for today. I'm going to go ahead and upload an invoice here. If you are connected to QuickBooks Online, everything will be brought over. But if you're not, you're able to add those yourself. But I'll just say, hi Colton, please make your monthly payment for your child's. Services. And I'm just going to go ahead and hit create. What we're doing is we're generating the secured payment link right here. This can be sent to customers.
vinay: Now, yeah, one thing you have a start date and end date. Is there a way to specify number of installment rather than end date?
Colton O'Farrell: So generally we're doing an end date for it. So if you had like a six month engagement, you would just have like six month end date out there, billed monthly is generally how we'd recommend that.
vinay: Yeah, I know, I mean, but no, but I was just, you know, some processor have the both option, either install or not.
Colton O'Farrell: I don't believe that's currently a setting enabled. I know it's something that the team would be working on. They're always trying to add new features and improvements. Right now, I believe it's just on a time frame.
vinay: That's fine. I mean, this is fine too. I was just curious.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah. Awesome. Yeah, of course. No, appreciate the question. So what this does though is we're generating a secure payment link for each of these individual invoices. So this is protected with encryption, tokenization. We're gonna send this via email, but if we wanted to send this as an SMS, we could add a phone number there. Once I hit send link, this is gonna go directly to the email.
vinay: Let me, so I can, will I get email as a merchant myself also?
Colton O'Farrell: You'll be notified via email when customers have paid their invoices, and then we also have within the transactions tab right here, so you could see on a receivable side, payables, refunds, returns and chargebacks. I just copied and pasted that secure link in case you were curious to see what this looked like. But here's my name, the email, my company logo, invoice name or number, the amount, and then this is the recurring payment. So they can either pay by card with the 2.99% fee clearly marked or they can.
vinay: Beautiful. Beautiful. So clean.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, of course. that's how we designed it to be as simple as possible. Your customers don't need to have an account with us. If they want to, they can create one, but otherwise they can just complete the payment through this. So that's me copying and pasting that.
vinay: In a new- Now, let me go ahead.
Colton O'Farrell: Go back to the invoice. Yeah. I'm actually, so I'm going to pop in. This is what your customer is going to receive. So it's going to show your name and logo. That's all customizable in the settings. So you can add that right there. But they would receive this invoice attached. They reply to the email, you'll automatically be CC'd on communication. And then when they hit the pay now option, it's again just that same screen that I showed you before.
vinay: Okay, yeah, you can leave it. Yeah, yeah, this screen. Keep it here. No, go to previous screen.
Colton O'Farrell: You want this screen?
vinay: No, no, the one with the payment fields. Yeah, just keep it here. Okay, please. so scroll down. So billing at. So all these fields are mandatory. Yeah.
Colton O'Farrell: So for you mean all the fields mandatory? Yes. So it would. This is just their routing, bank number, their name, their email, and then if they're. If they wanted to, like, I'm making a payment using a business account, if they. If they wanted to add that information, but.
vinay: Can I add a field here? Can I customize it?
Colton O'Farrell: What field would you be looking for?
vinay: Phone number.
Colton O'Farrell: So we don't have a phone number field listed on here.
vinay: No, no, you don't have. But my question, can I add the field? See, I'm used to installing our payment fields with other providers.
Colton O'Farrell: My question.
vinay: And you can always answer, oh, this is something or we have always, you are, if you are programmed to give me that standard answer, I'll accept that. I'm just kidding. Right.
Colton O'Farrell: I, you know, I don't know if we can add a phone number field.
vinay: I'm happy to ask.
Colton O'Farrell: Can you find out? Of course.
vinay: Yeah, absolutely. While we are on the, on the.
Colton O'Farrell: Call, you can chat on site. Unfortunately, unfortunately, I won't be able to get that question answered right on the call, but I'll absolutely follow up with my follow-up email. I'll
vinay: have that answer for you. For you, but that's just something I don't have right now and I can see that. Right, right. And when will I know the answer?
Colton O'Farrell: Today. Yeah, I'll get that.
vinay: But you have never seen anybody adding any custom field, right?
Colton O'Farrell: No, I haven't.
vinay: Oh, so maybe it's not there then.
Colton O'Farrell: Generally for this, I mean, we want to make this as frictionless as possible. We find out the more fields that you require, the less likely customers are to fill that out. I don't believe that this is customizable, but like I said, I'm happy to check with the team for you.
vinay: Yeah, that's okay. So a related question, once a 100 customer paid this way, for example, then I can download the spreadsheet?
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, so you can download anything from within the platform. So we do have like a transactions tab here where you just be able to download as a CSV file.
vinay: No, no, I, let me be specific. If I want to download with all the fields which are there for them to fill out, am I able to do that or not?
Colton O'Farrell: I don't believe so.
vinay: Okay.
Colton O'Farrell: But what it looks like, so setting up a customer is very easy. You just go to customer here. new customer, type in their name, hit save. For our Plus members, we also have something called a, you can set up payment authorization, which this is something that we send to your customer that would allow them, they would have agreed to allow you to auto pull from their account. Like I mentioned, this is a Plus feature only, so it wouldn't be relevant to you on the core plan, but in case you decided that you wanted the Plus plan, I just will show you what that looks like from your customer standpoint. So I'm just going to go ahead, whoops, not that one. Right here. Here we go. So this is what your customer would see on that payment authorization request setting them up. This isn't a requirement, but something that maybe would be helpful for you. So this is a payment authorization request from your customer. You can put a memo or notice in here. We have some frequently asked questions with answers right there. But what this form does is it allows you to automatically pull from their account on any invoice based on agreed upon terms. So this lets them know that this lets them know that Nickel is a payment processor that helps with AR, AP. All their information is protected. We're SOC 2 compliant. We handle the PCI compliance for any kind of credit card surcharges or fees. All of their money is in FDIC insured accounts and there's no money ever living within Nickel. They can revoke this authorization at any time and then it lets them know that you can either pay via ACH or via credit card. they just go to get started. If you had a transaction limit, say like $5,000 for a customer for about six minutes, sorry, for about six months or something, that would be in here. But for my example, there's no limit, no expiration date, and they would just agree to the terms, they would hit next, how they're going to pay that, and simply hit complete, and you would be able to pull from their account at any point. Not sure it's something that's going to be super relevant to you and your business. But that is something that we do enable and a lot of our customers enjoy. The last thing I wanted to show you was we also give customers, every customer who gets set up with us access to their own merchant link. So what I showed you before with this invoice, so this is a, there's a secured payment link that is generated on an individual invoice level. So we can process multiple invoices at one time, but we're never doing batch processing where it means Like even if you have ten invoices for one customer, we're going to process each invoice as its own atomic unit. So there's no chance of those getting crossed over. That allows for one to one reconciliation between you, your customer and your banks. But in addition to the secured payment links, we'll also set you up with your own payment portal. So most companies, and this is included in the free plan, most companies will go through, they'll add a banner, they can customize that how they like. But they'll actually take this payment portal and they will embed it in their own website to serve as kind of a one stop shop for customers to make payments or to serve as a backup option. But what this would do is allow your customer to come in here, make any kind of payment. So we'll just do this to show you. They would say, you know, $300 for my monthly childhood, like education services. You go to make a payment and they can simply pay by card or pay via ACH. And most, like I said, most companies we'll put this on their website and it'll be like a payment portal or pay here, make a payment sort of thing. But I do have a hard stop and I have another meeting that I'll have to hop to. What I'll do is I'll get questions for you, or your question answered about adding that custom phone number field there. I'll send you a recap demo video that covers most of what we walked through here. You can share that with your wife or the team. I'll also send you some pricing, security information, So you have all of that.
vinay: But do I have to unfreeze her credit? Do I have to unfreeze when I fill out the details to start the process? Because it asks for the social security number. Do I have to unfreeze her credit?
Colton O'Farrell: You said your wife's credit is currently frozen?
vinay: Yeah, we froze it because there was some problem.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, so we, I'm not sure if that would be an issue. I would maybe look at getting it unfrozen if you could. But what you need to do in order to create the account and start using Nickel is you just have to make your account. You need to link a payment method, because that's required in order to send or receive payments from Nickel. So once you do that, you'll be able to start sending and receiving payments. If for whatever reason you get any kind of notification that there's a problem with your account or there's some kind of denial, maybe it's related to the credit freeze, you can email support@nickel.com. or help@getnickel.com and you can let them know.
vinay: But Colton, what I, and it's not you, but to have that clarity upfront is helpful, right? One company told me that you don't need to do anything on freeze or anything and they approved the ACH. Other company said, oh, you need to, and they were specific enough to tell me, oh, unfreeze with the equipack. So, yeah, unfortunately, and also, I just.
Colton O'Farrell: Don'T know the answer.
vinay: Let me finish. So I also have other questions and now we have a hard stop. So how this works because I don't depend only on email. I'm more of a phone guy, you know, and that will one of the factor in deciding that I need that kind of service or whatever and not just email about so those small things I don't worry too much, but not to have the clarity upfront about whether it's a soft pool or whether it's a pool at all or not. And, you know, i'm not getting the answer. So that, you know, I don't want to just do. Okay. Yeah, apply and then we'll find out. I. I mean, I don't. I don't operate my business in that way where customer parents are not informed about upfront, about our no contract or billing or whatever, you know, so that. So if you don't mind, have, I don't know. looks like you may not have, when did you join the company?
Colton O'Farrell: I've been at the company about a month and a half. So I'm also very, right, right.
vinay: So would you mind if I request to have your, you have my number or no? Did I, I feel the number.
Colton O'Farrell: I do have back-to-back meetings all day. Like I said, I'll get you that email with the questions. I do have another meeting that's already going right now.
vinay: No, my request, I want to take my request. that a manager calls me back.
Colton O'Farrell: I don't think we have the bandwidth internally to do that. I will get you answers to your questions and I'll send that to you via email if you need to have. So we do have built-in support. I'll just show you that quickly. So within the account, if you have any questions, you can come right in here. We do have an account or you can go to the help center here. You can complete, send any kind of message. This will go directly to our team. They'll have if you want someone to call you and to get that assistance, they can. Like I said, we have a team dedicated to that. Unfortunately, I have back-to-back meetings, so I yeah, sure, sure.
vinay: No good luck. Thank you so much for your time. Take care.
Colton O'Farrell: Thank you. And I'll get the answers to your questions. Thank you so much. Appreciate your time and hopefully we can.
vinay: Work with you soon. Okay. Thanks. Bye. Bye.
