Chris’s iphone : Hey, Chris. Hey, guys. Hey, how's it going? Thanks for jumping on here.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, I really appreciate that. Chris, are you able to see me and we'll be able to see if I share my screen?
Chris’s iphone : Yeah, absolutely.
Colton O'Farrell: Okay, awesome. Well, with that squared away, I just wanted to thank you so much for jumping on the call and happy we made time to meet today. Just wanted to quickly go over the purpose and agenda of the call. Purpose of our call today is one, to get to know each other and discuss your onboarding with Nickel. We have 30 minutes here. Does that still work for you?
Chris’s iphone : Yeah, absolutely.
Colton O'Farrell: Awesome. So with that, the agenda for today then will be to share some details of my role as a customer success manager, what I know about US national steel, and then give you some opportunity to fill in the gaps for me. The outcome here is by the end of the call, we'll be selecting one of three onboarding packages that we offer depending on your timeline. We'll schedule those follow up calls to ensure that we have a smooth onboarding and we'll leave with the firmer understanding of how myself and Nick Nickel will be supporting your company. Does that sound like a fair agenda?
Chris’s iphone : Yeah, absolutely.
Colton O'Farrell: Awesome. Well, Chris, as the customer success manager for your account, I'll be helping by offering training, integration support, smooth customer onboarding experience, and then provide resources on how to best use Nickel given your specific use cases. For onboarding specifically, we offer three different onboarding plans to ensure we're holding to your timeline. And before we select which one of those makes the most sense for your company, is there anything specific about your timeline for using Nickel that I should know?
Chris’s iphone : Yeah. So how we've been doing it so far is we've been using Otter.ai, check by phone. There's Nickel's primarily for the ACH option that you guys have. So the authorized.net, just the fees are high. So we have been trying to, for a little while with ACH, we were using using it, fees were high. Then we started switching the check.
Colton O'Farrell: And what were those fees? Just curious what you guys.
Chris’s iphone : It was like.0075. So it was like every 100, 000 we spend, we're spending like 750 bucks.
Colton O'Farrell: I think that's. It was uncapped as well. Yeah.
Chris’s iphone : And then we gross, like, north of 500k a month. So, like, adds up, you know what I mean? And it turns into, like, a 5K fee. So we've been having our clients instead of do that, send us checks and wire, but that. Is harder to manage. So we're looking for just the best option ACH-wise.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, so we're looking to move away. So curious, what percentage of the business right now are you receiving payments in terms of wire transfers, checks, and then also this other service provider you're using today? How is that split up today?
Chris’s iphone : I would say 50% is wire and checks.
Colton O'Farrell: Okay. Got it. Well, we absolutely will be able to solve for that. And like you kind of know already, we do offer free unlimited ACH processing. I'm curious on a credit card standpoint, are you offering your customers the ability to pay via credit card today?
Chris’s iphone : Yeah, we do too.
Colton O'Farrell: Okay. And what does that look like for you today?
Chris’s iphone : That's probably about like 25% of our business, the credit cards.
Colton O'Farrell: And for if a customer wants to pay via credit card, can you kind of just walk me through that, the process?
Chris’s iphone : Yeah. So we use Panda Docs. As like initial purchase order. So we integrate the payment link through PandaDoc so they could pay like through that. That's like super important for us on the credit card side.
Colton O'Farrell: What do they charge for the credit card fee and how much is it? 3.4%. 3.4% and that's fully paid for by the customer or is it split between you two? How does that work today?
Chris’s iphone : So the way our payments, like we sell high ticket items. So we're selling products for like 50k pop to 100k pop to 150. So the first 18% is the deposit for the building. Just the one business, we eat the fee on it anyway. So after that, if a customer pays any more of the process with a credit card, they will take care of the fee.
Colton O'Farrell: I got it. Okay, that's really helpful information. Well, with Nickel, I'm not sure if you've had much insight into this, but essentially how it would work is you would send the invoice to your customer. They would receive it either via SMS or via email, and I'll walk you through through that. Of course, they would click on that email. It would, there would be a pay now button. They would click that and it would prompt them with two options. One, they could either pay with their bank via ACH for no fee. They would just need to enter their routing and account number, complete the payment there. Otherwise, if they want to pay via credit card, that's also an option for them. There is a 2.99% fee for credit card purchases that is 100 paid for by your customer. Like we There's a global rule. The default is 100% of your customer pay that if they want to pay with the credit card, you do a full control over that global rule. So you could change it to be 50/50, you could do 25/75, you could fully eat the costs, really any percentage you want there. But that's like a global rule. And then you also, even if you don't change the global rule, so you keep it at 100%, the customer pay for the invoice and the fee if they want to use a card. You can actually override the global settings on a customer and invoice level. So I'm happy to show you some of that, but just wanted to ask if you had any specific questions kind of with your knowledge of Nickel. Curious on how you found us originally and kind of what your understanding of us.
Chris’s iphone : Yeah, I was just looking for secure ways of payment with ACH with lower fees and authorized.net. So I saw you guys have like a thing where it's free, not free, but like there's no surcharge on the ACH. So what I was going to do at first was I was going to try to negotiate, authorize that net down. But even if I negotiate them down, you know, cut it in half, that's still eating the fee. So you guys have a better opportunity. You know, I'm all for that.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, what I'll tell you is most people find our pricing to be very straightforward and very cheap and happy to show you what that looks like. Did what, what insight and kind of research? So it sounds like you were, you know, mostly looking for a secure free way to do ACH or very cheap way. Luckily you found us who offer it for free. Beyond that, what else have you learned about Nickel thus far just to gauge your understanding?
Chris’s iphone : That was pretty much it.
Colton O'Farrell: Okay, cool. Well, like I said, I'll go ahead and show you the platform here in just a moment. Curious understanding more about your business. So I did some research online. Just was curious, how long have you guys been around for?
Chris’s iphone : A little over two years.
Colton O'Farrell: A little over two years. Okay. And then company size, are you guys above 10 employees less?
Chris’s iphone : I have like, I would say like eight people in office and then I have a lot of crews that are running around.
Colton O'Farrell: Okay. And then for the revenue side of the business, how much obviously as the payment kind of solution will be processing that revenue. So it is important for us to know what the volume is going to look like. What are you guys expecting kind of on an annual revenue perspective?
Chris’s iphone : For overall or just through Nickel?
Colton O'Farrell: Overall would be helpful. And then, yeah, through Nickel we can kind of understand from an AR versus AP standpoint, what part of the business that we'd be taking.
Chris’s iphone : But yeah, so I would say roughly looking at around like 7 million per year.
Colton O'Farrell: 7 million. Okay. And then for Nickel specifically, you have kind of, idea.
Chris’s iphone : It'll probably be around like 3.5 to 4 million, I would expect, if not more.
Colton O'Farrell: And that's because of the accounts receivable, mostly just managing accounts receivable with Nickel.
Chris’s iphone : Yeah. Yep.
Colton O'Farrell: For your kind of bill pay and paying bills today, can you kind of explain how that works for you?
Chris’s iphone : Yeah. So like I said, the 18% is the initial deposit to the customer. We send them like a purchase order and they'll sign and complete deposit. After that, then we'll finalize all the details on their building as they're coming in. Typically, they'll send a wire for the first 50% of the payment or first 50% of the remaining balance. So if Nickel is an easier way to do that, we'll add that on. That's been pretty good. But the problem that we're facing is we have a 25% due upon arrival payment. So when the guys get there with the building, customer usually has 25% and then the last one, 5% final payment when it's done. So the last 50 is where we're having a little bit of issues because it's more of like the customers even give it either giving the guys a check or they got to run and send a wire. And then customers are kind of just like, you know, at that point, the buildings out there, they're going to do it on their own time. So what we were looking to do is pretty much what I'm thinking is we're going to do is have them sign like a ACH authorization form. Once they get, once they arrive, then we can just run it with the information we have. Once the final payments done, we can just run it with the information they have. Yeah.
Colton O'Farrell: And that's something that we absolutely, so Nickel does like do debit authorization requests. So for the page, you say debit.
Chris’s iphone : Or ACH authorization request.
Colton O'Farrell: It can be, so we, we call it a debit authorization request, but it can either be like, you can charge essentially the payment method on file. So we can automatically pull via ACH or we could pull via the like credit or debit card as well. If it's ACH, there's no fee. If there's, the credit or debit card, it's the 2.99% fee.
Chris’s iphone : Okay.
Colton O'Farrell: But for your vendors and when you're paying them, how does that work today? So if you're ordering materials or if you have like a software solution you're using or like when it comes to paying the bills for the business, what does that process look like? Are you paying bills?
Chris’s iphone : Like material, I'll either wire or I'll deposit a check to their bank account. Okay, awesome.
Colton O'Farrell: Well, you can also absolutely when you're set up with Nickel, you do have full access to AR and AP. We have over 10,000 business who use us for AR, AP or both. So when you're set up with your account, you have access to that. And if you're paying bills via Nickel with ACH, again, there's no fee there. What I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead and share my screen now. If you want to just let me know if you can see this, okay.
Chris’s iphone : Happy to zoom in as well. Yep, all good.
Colton O'Farrell: Cool. Awesome. Well, when you're set up with Nickel, so you've created your account, the next step that you need to do in order to start sending and receiving payments is go to account settings, Go to this Get Paid tab here and link your bank account. We need to link a payout method so we know where the money is coming and going. Once you've done that, you're good to start sending or receiving payments via Nickel. Question for you today with your accounting system. What are you guys operating on?
Chris’s iphone : We use QuickBooks.
Colton O'Farrell: Is that desktop or online?
Chris’s iphone : What do you mean? Desktop, I guess.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, there's QuickBook Desktop Enterprise and then there's a QuickBook QuickBooks Online version.
Chris’s iphone : You think you're using desktop?
Colton O'Farrell: Let me sign in and see.
Chris’s iphone : Yeah, that'd be awesome.
Colton O'Farrell: QuickBooks Online. Oh, QuickBooks Online. Perfect. Well, the next step I would recommend for you guys then. So once after you've connected your bank account and have the account essentially activated to send or receive payments via Nickel, you would come to this Integrations tab right here. You'd click this link QuickBooks account button. This would bring you to Intuit's QuickBooks page. You'd sign in with your login password, select your company chart of accounts. Once you do so, everything then would flow into Nickel from an accounts receivable perspective here, as well as an accounts payable perspective here. We can bring in all of your customers, all of your vendors.
Chris’s iphone : Yeah, so I do, I have it integrated. Awesome.
Colton O'Farrell: Oh, you already have that done. Perfect. Well, once you have that done, you'll notice here you'll have all of your invoices brought in. You'll also have like a little QuickBooks symbol if that's been created. From QuickBooks. So the one thing that I would recommend, it doesn't sound like you're sending any payments via QuickBooks anyways today, but when you're generating an invoice within QuickBooks, you'll want to make sure you hit review and save rather, or sorry, you'll want to click save the invoice rather than review and send, because if you send the invoice via QuickBooks Online, as well as Nickel, your customer would get two invoices. So anytime you're generating those in QuickBooks, Just make sure you save them. Nickel will automatically grab them and bring them into platform here. And we have some automation we can turn on for those to be automatically sent out. Where it's not good to have automation turned on is if once you generate an invoice, you need to go through, make changes to it, edit it, because anytime you edit the invoice, your customer would get an email if the automation is turned on. So if you're generally creating an invoice and it's pretty static, you don't have to make changes. You can definitely turn on some automation to have those automatically sent. But if you do have to make some changes or don't want those to be sent automatically, you can just come right into Nickel once those invoices are created, they're pulled in here. You'd simply go to this request payment button. It's going to send this secure payment link right here, either via email or SMS, depending on the way that you want to do that. All you have to do is hit send link. Payment links been sent. If you were curious of what that would look like prior to sending your customer, you can copy and paste that into a new tab. So this is what your customer will see. They'll see your name, email, the branded logo, invoice name or purpose. The invoice from QuickBooks will be brought in. I just have a templated one here. They'll have those two options to pay. So they can either pay via ACH in their bank, no fee there, or they can pay with a card. There's a 2.99% fee there, like I mentioned before. They just need to enter that information. You will get, you will only get the net amount. So in this case, you would get the thousand dollars. Nickel handles all the PCI compliance. So we would get the 2920 as our fee. I did tell you that you have full control over those settings on the surcharge rate. So you would just to access that, you would go into account settings here, this get paid tab, and this is where the global, the global rules at. So it's set at 100% default that your customer paid for that fee. But if you wanted to split that 50/50, if you wanted to fully eat the cost, you could do that. But by default, again, set at 100% there. But I told you, you can go in on an individual invoice level and actually modify that. So we can go to settings here and we can change this to be like any kind of rate we'd like.
Chris’s iphone : And that- so you're saying I can put it in for like the 2.99% fee and then they would just be charged that on on the back end without me doing the math for 2.99 and putting on top.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep, you don't ever have to do the math on that. You simply have to send the invoice amount as is that net amount. We handle all the fees, compliance, whenever you change this. So if I were to create, I'll add you as a quick customer. I'll go ahead and delete you once we're off this call, but just so you can see kind of what it would look like and I'll adjust that what the fee would look like. So I'm just going to go to new customer, just going to enter in company name, grab your email address. And also there is this payment authorization as well. So we'll get into pricing and the plans in just a moment. But if you were to click this setup payment authorization as well, this would be to automatically pull from your customer's account with certain criteria. So you can either have a like threshold limits. So say up to $25,000. You could have no limit if you want. There could be an expiration date of a year or no expiration date, but it's whatever kind of criteria your customer agrees to. We would send them an email. They would see the payment authorization request form. Simply click to agree to that. And once they've done so, you would automatically be able to pull from their account based on your due dates for your invoices. But we're going to go ahead and just add you as a customer quick. I'm going to generate an invoice directly from Nickel. You don't have to do this. You can continue to generate them within QuickBooks Online. We'll pull them in here. But since my account's not connected, I'm.
Chris’s iphone : Just-- Hey, so sorry about that. I had someone FaceTiming, so they disconnected. All right.
Colton O'Farrell: Sorry.
Chris’s iphone : I didn't hear the last 30 seconds.
Colton O'Farrell: Oh, no worries. What I was saying, I was talking a little bit about the payment authorization form. So I added you as a customer. Anytime you're adding a customer, you you can send them a form, this payment authorization form, if you'd like. You would set specific like criteria as well as when that would expire. So you could say it's up to $25,000 for a year. As long as that invoice meets within the criteria that your customers agree to, we just automatically be able to pull from their account. I'm not setting up the payment authorization with you. I'm just going to create an invoice so you can see kind of what it looks like from your end. So we'll just call this 166-904-25. We'll just say this is for $1,000 one time. We can also set up recurring and have that set up on a weekly, monthly, quarterly, or yearly basis, but we'll just do the one time here. Put a quick note. Hi, Chris. Please make the payment. As soon as possible.
Chris’s iphone : So what would be the best way to do it? Right. So I'll get the first 50 of the remaining balance. I don't have an exact date for them as we're, like, building the building, meaning, like, manufacturing it, bringing it out. Yep. And then the day is going to be completed. So I see when you do recurring, has you pick specific dates. So what would be a better way to do that? I guess just do one time. Yeah. And then have them sign a different document for ACH authorization, like a contract.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, so we will send them a form to fill out via Nickel for the payment authorization. So if you click that to send, you click the payment authorization, you would enter kind of the threshold limit as well as when that expires, that would be sent to your customer. They would simply agree to those terms or not. If they don't agree, you would just have to align on what the limit threshold and timeline looks like. They also do have the ability to end the authorization at any point, just to make sure your customer has still that autonomy and kind of control there. What I would recommend in your case, if they're making a partial payment, so what you can do in the advanced settings, one, I'm going to change that fee. So in this case, we're going to split that kind of 50/50. If you wanted customers to be able to make a partial payment, you can also turn this on to allow customers to edit the payment amount. So if they want to pay like, you know, 50% of that invoice, you would just simply have this turned on. Your customer would pay that portion and then there would still be an outstanding balance essentially and it would show you in the platform here. So I'm going to go ahead and do that if you wanted to see what it looks like if a customer makes a partial payment. So I'm creating that invoice. I also just grabbed a sample one just to show you that we can attach those from QuickBooks. So don't need to look into the actual attachment, but I'm going to send that. Now should get that here in just a moment. Wanna let me know and then that's.
Chris’s iphone : For debit card or whatever.
Colton O'Farrell: So this is for ACH or debit slash credit card. So when you get that email, you.
Chris’s iphone : Should get, so when you do ACH, was there, would there still be a fee that you would invest or not?
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, no fee whatsoever for you or for your customers.
Chris’s iphone : Okay, I got you. And then you said they could turn that off, I guess. Is that like no matter what platform you use? Is that just the guidelines?
Colton O'Farrell: And debit authorization?
Chris’s iphone : Yeah, the ACH authorization. Yes.
Colton O'Farrell: So that is for you send your customer a form, say it's for $10,000 for a year, your customer agrees to that, and you've been doing that for six months, but the relationship changes for whatever reason, they can, they do, we let them know that they can remove this authorization at any time, and if they do that, then you just have to either send these invoices, for them to complete the payment as I've sent to you and you just hit that pay now button, or you would have to resend an authorization form with a more agreed upon kind of criteria.
Chris’s iphone : Okay, I got you. Because I was going to do, I didn't know if it was better to do it that way or just send them a template to fill out their information. I guess what's typically you see more on the banking side. I'm not really too sure. I haven't done it before.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, typically, Nickel's, so how we mostly operate is you were, Nickel's designed so that only you need to see your sensitive banking information and only your customers need to see their information. If it's information you already have, you are able, that's more kind of on.
Chris’s iphone : The.
Colton O'Farrell: Like accounts payable side with vendors. So if you go to like set up a new vendor to make a payment, so the AR and AP work very similar. You just go to new vendor. If you have their information, you can enter it. So you can say whether they're business, individual, contractor. If you have their banking information, like direct deposit, you can add that yourself. If you don't, we can also send them a form to complete that information. You just need to enter their name, email address, and if you want them to use or to get paid via ACH, because we do allow checks to be sent, you could toggle this on. So only ACH.
Chris’s iphone : I could pay them via ACH as well.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep. So I'm going to pop over. There's two more things I'm going to show you. I know we're kind of running up here on time, but one thing that this may be helpful. Helpful for you. This is something that serves as a backup method for a lot of our customers, but you do have this payments portal and you have it on day one. This mostly serves as a backup method for customers to make a payment. So this isn't tied to a specific invoice. Most of our customers will, they will, you know, add their customized branded branding logo, banner, that kind of customization there. They will embed it in their website and this will serve as kind of a one-stop shop for a customer to make any kind of payment. They will have those same options, so either free ACH or they can pay by card with that fee. But this is something that is completely customizable. We can change the URL and domain as well if you'd like that to be more representative of the company and literally just embed it in your website. So this can serve as a backup method for the pricing and plans. So I'm going to pop open that here quick. So based on our conversation, kind of what you guys are doing for business, I would imagine the Nickel Plus is what you're going to want to go with. That is either $45 monthly or it's $35 a month on an annual plan. So it's billed one time at $420. There's a discount of 20% there. What this allows for is free unlimited ACH up to a million dollars per transaction. You can have unlimited users on the account. You can schedule payments in advance. Do recurring payments, you can auto debit your customers with that authorization. The ACH processing time is generally a two day turnaround time, as long as you get it in before our cutoff time of 4:00 PM Eastern Time. There's no additional charges, transaction charges, or hidden fees here. The only way you would pay more than that $420 is if you agree to eat some of the credit card surcharge on accounts receivable. Or if you pay bills with Nickel via your credit card, in which case there's that 2.9% fee. But this is the plan that I would recommend for you given the size of your invoices and some of the additional features you're looking for. We do give you a 14-day kind of free trial to check that out. And the last thing within Nickel. Oh yeah, go ahead.
Chris’s iphone : Okay, yeah. So just a few questions I have. So the first one, so on authorized.net there is a feature where a lot of times customers will just call us and they'll do like a check by phone type of thing. I know you don't have that directly maybe, but do you guys have like something like that on your platform that would be able to do something like that where we enter the customer's banking information and then run it like that or no?
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, so how that would work.
Chris’s iphone : Because you're just manually putting it in.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah.
Chris’s iphone : So you would just put in the customer's information and then. Yep.
Colton O'Farrell: So that is more on the account. So we do allow for that, but that's more for accounts payable on the accounts receivable side. We would either send your customer. So here, let me just do. So here's with that payment authorization. So there's full permission or limited permissions. That's where you add the transaction limit if you like the expiration date. We would send this to your customer. So I'm going to go. I'll just say hi. Awesome. So that just sent email should be coming in just a moment. But that it would be for your customers to come to essentially add that payment authorization and you would just Auto be able to charge their account. That is the method that typically customers do rather than, you know, somebody calling them on the phone and then type typing it in themselves. Because it also reduces kind of the risk or if there's like a fat finger mistake from the person who's entering that those digits. But what it looks like for your customer, say they would receive an email that looks like this, say that so DeGraaf Distributions by demo account that they want to save your payment method on file for future transactions, maximum transaction amount when it expires, they would go to complete the form. So it lets them know that this authorization is for you to auto pull from their account. It lets them know that we're SOC 2 compliant, protecting all their information. We handle all the PCI compliance. We're moving money through FDIC insured accounts. They would just simply go to get started. They would select that they agree to those terms, and then they would list what option that they're going to pay for. So if they want to use their bank with no fee, they could do that right there. Or if they wanted to pay via card, that's how they would do that.
Chris’s iphone : So, yeah, so you guys don't like support pretty much the check by phone feature.
Colton O'Farrell: Not at the moment.
Chris’s iphone : That is something that's not a big deal. I was just wondering if there's a workaround. They're like, Hey, here's my banking details. Can you just run it for me? You can't do that.
Colton O'Farrell: Absolutely. Yep. And I know that's something we have some additional features that the team has been building out and I know that is something.
Chris’s iphone : No, that's fine.
Colton O'Farrell: Working on, but currently not available.
Chris’s iphone : Okay. Because then that would defeat the authorization form that they would fill out and send us the template and then we have their information pretty much in the way I was thinking of doing it is having them fill that out and then we would call to confirm, hey, can we run this charge? And then the same thing, run this charge. But if it doesn't support that, that's fine. I was just wondering, I'd rather.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, absolutely. No, that was a great question to ask. So appreciate you clarifying. And if there's any updates on our end, I'll be sure to update you on that in the future. So I know we're running over time a little bit. So what we typically do on the end of this call is One, like I mentioned early on, we do have three kind of onboarding plans that are specific for your timeline. So it's either we do a one week onboarding plan, a one month onboarding plan, or a three month or quarterly onboarding plan. What kind of those timeframes do you think works best for you? Are you guys looking to get started right away? Want to do the one week? Are you needing some more time and kind of want to test out the platform and looking for like a month?
Chris’s iphone : What? Yeah, let's do a month.
Colton O'Farrell: One month. Okay. Awesome.
Chris’s iphone : And then if I want to get started sooner, I could just email you, right?
Colton O'Farrell: Absolutely. So what we'll do is we're going to schedule that time now if that works for you. So we'll schedule one call within this month here. And then following that, we'll schedule a call for three months in the future, just as a kind of touch base, understand what you've done thus far with Nickel. But for this month, how does, let's see, the week of the 15th or the week of this 22nd work for you?
Chris’s iphone : Let's do week of the 15th.
Colton O'Farrell: 15Th. And do you prefer mornings, evenings? What works best for you?
Chris’s iphone : Let's do a evening call.
Colton O'Farrell: Evening. How does Tuesday the 16th at, let's see, we could either do 3 PM your time, 4 PM your time.
Chris’s iphone : We could do 3 PM.
Colton O'Farrell: 3 PM.
Chris’s iphone : Yep.
Colton O'Farrell: Awesome. Well, I'll go ahead and send that once we get off the call here. I'll also send a second invite for three months in the future just so we have that locked in because my calendar can fill up pretty quickly. I'm also going to send some additional resources to you via email, so in case you need anything to reference again. But on that call that we have on September 16th, is there anybody else from the team that you would want to kind of be on the call to just have questions answered or kind of walk through similar of what we.
Chris’s iphone : I'll send you their information if they're going to be able to jump in.
Colton O'Farrell: Perfect. I also have a pre-recorded demo that I can share as well, so happy to do that too, if they kind of prefer like an asynchronous learning there. Yeah, perfect.
Chris’s iphone : Wonderful.
Colton O'Farrell: Well, Chris, it's been a pleasure. You'll get that those meeting invites as well as that follow-up email for me in just a moment. If you have any other questions that come up in the meantime, though, you can always reach out to me. We also have built-in chat support. If you reply within the app, we're generally having somebody respond within eight minutes there. But if you're not getting the answers that you need, you can always contact me as well.
Chris’s iphone : All right. Thank you very much.
Colton O'Farrell: And thank you for your time. Yeah, it was a pleasure meeting you. Hope you have a great rest of.
Chris’s iphone : Your day and really looking forward to supporting your business.
Colton O'Farrell: Absolutely.
Chris’s iphone : Thank you very much. Take care. Bye bye.
