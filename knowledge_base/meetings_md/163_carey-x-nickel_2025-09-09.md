Jacob Greenberg: Hey, Chris, how's it going?
Chris' phonr (2): Hey, I'm good. How you doing?
Jacob Greenberg: All good.
Chris' phonr (2): Sorry about that, man.
Jacob Greenberg: Hey, no problem. Happy we can make some time.
Chris' phonr (2): Yeah, ma'am.
Jacob Greenberg: So, yeah, I know that you responded to Zach's email a little bit over a week ago now about QuickBooks fees and how we could help alleviate them. So I have, I still have 30 minutes on my calendar here. Does that still work for you?
Chris' phonr (2): Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: So yeah, typically we start these calls with just the point of them is to get to know your business a little more, have you learn a little bit more about Nickel, and then from that information, what I can do is I can show you a demonstration of the tool just built for exactly what you guys would want to focus on. And by the end of the call, we should have a good understanding of what we do and if it might be a good fit for you.
Chris' phonr (2): Okay, cool.
Jacob Greenberg: That's a little bit of background on your business.
Chris' phonr (2): Yes. So. The business that I'm wanting to discuss this stuff with for is a custom home building company in Nantucket. And, you know, we're fairly busy construction operation and For many years now, I've been doing the QuickBooks thing and the QuickBooks is good. A lot of my customers are using the QuickBooks payments now, which is great, but there's so many fees associated with it. I have a hard time keeping track of it. All the bookkeepers do a pretty good job, but I know it's adding up to a lot of money, especially especially when they use a credit card. And that's taken 3% out of my profit. And I'm billing sometimes $70,000. So do the math. It's like ridiculous. And. If I can avoid these fees, that'd be great. We're moving into the next cycle of business right now and things are looking to double here and I'm just looking for a way to save money for the company and us. And it sounds like you guys have a plan to do that, but we're just a custom home building company. We focus mostly on that and we just want to see what we can do to save some money.
Jacob Greenberg: Awesome. Yeah, this is a very, very common use case that we see and we work mainly with contractors, construction, building businesses. So I know you said you're looking to double right now. Can you give me a little bit more clarity on, you know, so you said sometimes you're building seventy thousand dollars and you're paying the three percent of that. So what is like, how many transactions are you looking at doing throughout the year? What are the average size of these transactions?
Chris' phonr (2): You know, I try to bill weekly to our project for our projects. And, you know, we did about, we did over four million dollars worth of business last year, and I would say. Probably half of those bills were paid by ACH.
Jacob Greenberg: And the other half were- and the.
Chris' phonr (2): Other half they send a check or something. Yeah. But it's probably even more than that. Probably more like three quarters of them are paying via the- I'm not getting a lot of checks. More and more it's happening through the internet and that's great. Yeah, yeah, I would say, and this year, you know, we're looking to do $8 million with the business and I bill weekly and most of those invoices, you know, weekly invoices at a, you know, probably $30,000 a week that are happening. We have like probably 3-4 jobs going on, so we're billing out, you know, $100,000 a week at least when we're busy. And that's like four or five invoices a week that I'll get paid average, I would say $30,000 in invoice.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. Okay, got it. And so right now you're generating that invoice that you're sending out from within QuickBooks and it's coming out via QuickBooks Pay. The customers are sending this to have the option to pay via credit card or via ACH, but both incur a fee for you.
Chris' phonr (2): Yeah, yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: Got it. Yeah.
Chris' phonr (2): And like, I don't try, I try to not do the credit card thing. One client, he requested it and then I was like, okay, but I gotta charge you this 3% and whatever. It's just a mess to keep track of it.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah. All right. I'll show you how we do this. This is gonna be a really easy fix for you actually. So currently, roughly 30K a week, four to five invoices a week, or 30K per invoice, roughly four or five of them a week. You're doing QuickBooks, you're sending it out. When somebody pays that, two questions here. So one, QuickBooks will typically batch payments into your bank account. Is that something, are you guys using QuickBooks online or QuickBooks desktop?
Chris' phonr (2): We're doing QuickBooks online.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. So when you go in for reconciliation, is there other people on your team, like counting people that are mostly managing QuickBooks, or is it mostly you?
Chris' phonr (2): No, it's. I have a guys team. Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: So we can give access to nickel to all the people that you need. I could also do a separate training for them, if it makes sense.
Chris' phonr (2): Okay. Got it.
Jacob Greenberg: Do you know the rates that you're on with QuickBooks? I know that QuickBooks recently up. Either like increase the rates in the last quarter or they're looking to do so by the end of the year. But it depends on like they grandfather some people in on certain rates.
Chris' phonr (2): Right. I mean, and I've been using QuickBooks for 30 or 20 years, but I don't think I got grandfathered in. If I log into QuickBooks, can we look at that rate?
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, I think you should be able to see it on maybe if you go to an example of a past transaction. What I'm looking to see is if it's Percentage based or if it's cost per transaction.
Chris' phonr (2): So I'm going to go to customers and then let me see here. Might have to log back in here in a second. Good. So let me just go to one of our main customers here that we've been working with. And look at 4 Gay Street, open and wide. And look at like a invoice that we built out. So here's an invoice from July. It was $77,910.25. And if I view that invoice, I don't know, I wonder, let's see if I can, Find out because they pay it online. They send me a payment. It's paid usually the next day.
Jacob Greenberg: So if you could see it there, that'd be great. Otherwise, I am sending you a little three-step instruction on how you can find your fees in QuickBooks. You can follow that if it's easier too.
Chris' phonr (2): This is coming to my email.
Jacob Greenberg: I put it in the Zoom chat, but I could also throw it in an email if it's easier.
Chris' phonr (2): Let me see in the Zoom chat here.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, you're on your laptop on Zoom or.
Chris' phonr (2): I'm on my laptop on QuickBooks.
Jacob Greenberg: I got you and my phone on.
Chris' phonr (2): Okay, how about I shoot you an email with it? Then it might be easier for you. No, it's fine. I got it here. Sign into the Merchant Services Center. And then let's go back then. Merchant Services. Hang on. Merchant Services Center. Sign into the merchants. I sign into the Merchant Services Center. How the hell do I do that?
Jacob Greenberg: Here, I'll send you. I'm going to send it to you in an email because this is a link that might be able to help. But we could also, if it is frustrating to do now, we could do this later. My goal in doing this is just to see exactly the costs you are incurring, what plan you're currently on. But either way we'll reduce the costs for you. I just want to make sure that we have an accurate understanding of what's going on within your business.
Chris' phonr (2): Yeah, I wish I could tell you right now. I just don't know.
Jacob Greenberg: They don't make it easy.
Chris' phonr (2): It's like, okay, so I'm logged into QuickBooks right now, but what I need to log into, I believe, is Intuit, my Intuit account, to go to the Merchant Services Center, which is different, right? Well, it says, Intuit. Intuit.
Jacob Greenberg: Caught you an email with the link for merchant services in there.
Chris' phonr (2): You sent me an email? Yep. Okay. And let's go to my mail. Link to Merchant Services there. Okay. See when I click that it just takes me to my QuickBooks account.
Jacob Greenberg: Let's see.
Chris' phonr (2): Yeah, I believe so. And then Merchant Services Center. Okay. I think it's working actually. Let's get you logged in. Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: Unless you're grandfathered in, which is kind of what we're looking for. The current rate is 1.75% of ACH transactions.
Chris' phonr (2): Okay. So yeah, it's a lot of money.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah.
Chris' phonr (2): No matter. It used to be like a flat fee. It was like $25 for them to like, Pay via QuickBooks. This is just taking me in a loop. Every time I click it, it says, enter your Intuit password. I'm doing that.
Jacob Greenberg: All right. Well, it will be good to figure out at some point, and maybe you can ask your accounting team, but for my estimates on just the information you gave me about what you're currently transacting, say 100% of that was ACH. You're looking at roughly $10,500 a month in fees.
Chris' phonr (2): Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: So that's roughly 126, 126, 000 annually. Let me show you, Nickel, it might give you some reprieve from the complexity of QuickBooks real quick.
Chris' phonr (2): Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: Let me get my demo environment going. One second here. Chris, are you in Nantucket year round or is that just where the business is located?
Chris' phonr (2): That's where the business is located. But. My, I'm back and forth between Vermont and Nantucket every week.
Jacob Greenberg: Oh, nice.
Chris' phonr (2): Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: Awesome. Where about in Vermont are you?
Chris' phonr (2): I'm in Woodstock, Vermont.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, cool.
Chris' phonr (2): Yeah, just outside of Killington.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. One of my best friends grew up in Burlington and my sister went to school over in Bennington.
Chris' phonr (2): Oh, nice. Yeah, that's where I'm hoping my kids will go.
Jacob Greenberg: Oh, yeah. Yeah, it's a great area. All right, I'll give you a quick walk. Can you see my screen here, Chris?
Chris' phonr (2): Yes, yes. I'm still trying to log in here to this QuickBooks and I tried something different. I want to see if it's working. Use passkey. I just really want to know what it is.
Jacob Greenberg: You know what? If it doesn't make sense to do it right now, if we can't figure it out. What I will do is we'll set up a follow-up call here. After I walk you through what this platform looks like, we're going to want it to offer another demonstration for your team that currently manages QuickBooks anyway, so they can get familiar with Nickel. On that call, we could work with them to find this information too.
Chris' phonr (2): Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: Make it an agenda item for our next call. Does that sound okay? Yeah. Okay, great. Here is essentially going to be the summary page. This is a demo environment, so we only have a few pieces of information in here, transactions. But once you have some of your own transit actions, you'll quickly be able to see an overview of receivables, payables, and your latest transactions. And from here, you'll be able to see all of your transaction history as well. So accounts receivable, payable, etc. The first thing you'll do with setting up your account is popping into the integrations tab and linking your QuickBooks account. This can take between 30 seconds and 3 minutes, depending on the amount of information you have, but it's a one-time thing. Once you sync your QuickBooks, all that information is going to be auto synced. So hold on one second. We're going to open a different demo environment here. Just one that has a little bit more information. Here you go. So you'll be able to see all of your previous transactions. The cool thing with the sync from Nickel and QuickBooks is that all the information in the process that you currently take within QuickBooks to generate your invoices It'll automatically populate with a nickel. So you'll just pop in a nickel to see all of your invoices that were created active, completed and paid, scheduled and outgoing, etc, etc. I'll show you how to create an invoice if you want to create one in nickel because it will push back into QuickBooks as well and what it looks like for your customer once they receive them. So creating an invoice here, I'll do Chris as a test, add you as a new customer. I'm going to put my email address here so I show you what it looks like when you receive the invoice. Now, when you're sending these invoices from QuickBooks, are you typically using invoice numbers or do you use like an invoice purpose or a memo?
Chris' phonr (2): Invoice numbers.
Jacob Greenberg: Invoice numbers. Okay, great. So I'll put an example number here. Put 30,000 as a transaction. One important thing to note that's different between Nickel and QuickBooks is when the money gets settled in your account from a QuickBooks pay for larger transactions, and you might have noticed this already, they batch settle it. So if you have like a $25,000 transaction, it might get settled in your bank account as $5,000 transactions. With Nickel, it's one to one. So we can handle larger transactions. So single Transaction of 100,000 will be deposited in your account as one single transaction.
Chris' phonr (2): I haven't noticed if that's happening or not.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. Yeah, it's just a little tidbit. Do you guys ever do recurring payments or they mostly one time?
Chris' phonr (2): We just do, we bill weekly mostly on a time material basis.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. And I guess they're going to be different transactions each week.
Chris' phonr (2): Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: That's gotcha. So we'll do the one time here. You'll have the invoice date for when the invoice was created and the due date. So if you're setting net terms, say, hey, they need to pay this in 30 days or in 60 days, you can put that due date here. Payment for services in Nantucket. So you can put a little note for the customer. And you can also upload any documents that you want. So if you have photos of the job site or a PDF agreement contract that was signed with the customer, anything about net terms, you could upload that document right here as well. Now, from the advanced side, you can enable or disable credit card payments. Essentially, every customer using Nickel keeps credit card payment option enabled because you're going to be able to pass that fee to the customer and you're just giving them the option to choose to pay completely free via ACH or for them to incur the 3% fee via credit card. So you're just giving them the option.
Chris' phonr (2): Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: Go ahead and click Create. And I'll show you what it looks like to receive this as an email. So you can send it as an email or as a text message to your customer. DeGrood distribution is our demo environment name. So this will be your company name with your logo as well. And it will read however you would want, but typically it's going to be company name with invoice number next to it. You'll have the bill number and the memo, and you go ahead and click pay now, and this is what your customer will be receiving. So any documents you've attached will be here. Any previous transaction history will show below this right here, and they get elected to pay by card or by bank. They'll see this if it's the first time that they're making a transaction with you. Otherwise, you can save their card method on file and auto charge it if you want to. But essentially, the one thing to show here is that they have the option to pay by bank or by card. It's completely free with no fees to pay ACH, or there's a 2.99% fee to pay by card. That fee is automatically applied on your customer's end so they could see what the end price is going to be. And there's no extra steps for you to adjust your invoices. We find that roughly 17 to 20% of the time, Nickel users customers opt to pay by card because they have a cash flow advantage there. They get points. A lot of people already have 3% cash back cards to begin with. Now, if your customer wants to customize the payment amount, they can as well. So they can type in 15,000 and decide to pay half by card and half by bank. If they want to. And then once they click pay, they go back into this, you could come back here and it'll be updated as paid. It'll also automatically reflect in your QuickBooks as well. So you can keep track of any customers, how much of the total that they've paid, which ones have been completed, which ones are scheduled, and so on. Now I have a couple other cool hidden gems inside here that I'd love to show you little Easter eggs. But as far as I know, the biggest thing for you to focus on right now is just reducing the cost and being able to have a seamless experience with QuickBooks. Does this look like it's going to be able to solve that for you? What are your thoughts on?
Chris' phonr (2): I mean, it looks like the problem with the 3% thing when people pay with a credit card is pretty much covered there. And then I guess the only thing All this matters to me is, although there's two things. One is more software, more training, more layers of technology. That's what we're talking about here. And I just hate that. But secondly, it's all just like, all right, what am I spending? What I spent last year on all my QuickBooks fees, and what am I going to spend with you guys, right? How much am I going to save if I use you guys? If I'm gonna save $15,000, I'll do it.
Jacob Greenberg: Right, so my estimate, I'm not even calculating credit card, and I can do that for you as well, but I don't have the percentage of times that people pay by card. So I'm just gonna focus on ACH. From the math that I did before, if 100% of your transactions are ACH, you'd be paying $126,000 annually in fees. You said roughly 75% is, so that's 94,500.
Chris' phonr (2): And we could see that on my profit and loss report, right?
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, you probably should be able to. It depends on how your accounts are keeping the books. Yeah. But regardless, it's going to be more than that 10,000, 15,000 that you said. With Nickel, there's two platforms. There's Nickel Core, which is free to use, free to sign up for, but it caps the transaction limit at 25,000 per transaction. So for you, I would recommend Nickel Plus, which costs $35 a month.
Chris' phonr (2): Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: So if you take $96,000 minus the fee for using us for a year, you would still be saving $95,580.
Chris' phonr (2): Yeah, I just really want to see what I paid in fees for accepting payments last year. And then for you guys, it's a $35 a month fee. And then you earn.
Jacob Greenberg: Whenever a customer of yours elects to pay by credit card, we get a percentage of that credit card, but it doesn't come from you. It comes from the customer.
Chris' phonr (2): Yeah. And then do you make money when they don't you make money when they do ACH at all? Nope. There's no fee there.
Jacob Greenberg: No fee.
Chris' phonr (2): Oh, you guys make money on that $35 fee for per the month? Yep.
Jacob Greenberg: We have a monthly software fee, the occasional revenue generated from credit card. But most importantly here, I'll give you a little bit of background about Nickel because I said I would in the beginning and I hadn't. But our founder comes from Stanley Black & Decker's innovation team. And so we're initially backed by Stanley Black and Decker and DeWalt. And it was originally designed for contracting and construction businesses that are very check heavy, that have poor cash flow because checks are sitting in a truck for seven days. It takes a while to get it from the customer. And cash flow is really important in these businesses. We quickly learned that the solution could be built for other customer types as well, businesses that have come into us to request to use our service. But the reason I bring this up is because we really see ourselves as a cash flow company. So right now we've built technology that is able to process ACH at incredibly low cost for us so we can offer it for free to the customer. And in the future, what we hope to do is to provide more optional products that improve cash flow, like trade credit or more advanced net terms products for businesses. And we hope that they'll be able to use it. So we're looking at the free AE as that $1.50 Costco hot dog to get you in the door. And obviously it has a huge impact in and of itself already.
Chris' phonr (2): So. Well, because QuickBooks is seriously expensive.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah.
Chris' phonr (2): Right. Okay. All right.
Jacob Greenberg: Well, I think I just wanted to address the one thing you said with software real quick. Yeah. So I know that you're. Can you walk me through a little bit about your concerns regarding.
Chris' phonr (2): Well, it's just, in my experience is like anything that's implemented that's new. There's always some sort of growing pains when you implement new technologies. With the QuickBooks company I'm using, we just implemented this thing called Adaptive that's going to be like an AI thing that takes the script. It's just supposed to help. It was wonky at first. It's still wonky and things aren't working like they're supposed to. It causes trouble. There's other software programs I've looked at, you know, to help us organize things for the company. I go and sign up for these things and then we get going and then it's just like, you know, it's hard. Technology's not my forte. I'm a builder. And then when you throw another layer of bookkeeping technology on top of the QuickBooks already, I just know it's there's always some sort of thing that doesn't work. We got to call and schedule some sort of time to figure that out. We got to coordinate with the bookkeeper. We got to coordinate with the accountant, whatever it is, coordinate with the office, get us on the same page so we can figure out this problem. And, you know, it just jams things up. The good news is right now is a perfect time to do it because we're not busy.
Jacob Greenberg: Awesome.
Chris' phonr (2): So we have a little bit of, this is a perfect time to implement some new software. And it sounds like this software layer is not that challenging. But one question, this invoices that I said to my clients from QuickBooks, when the customer sees those, they still see the same invoice, right?
Jacob Greenberg: If you're using Nickel.
Chris' phonr (2): Well, so help me understand this. I have QuickBooks at the moment. I invoice through QuickBooks. So you're saying that all my invoices will come from Nickel, not QuickBooks?
Jacob Greenberg: So there are two ways that our customers do this. The preferred method and most common one is you sync your QuickBooks. You do the work on creating the invoice within QuickBooks. It'll auto populate in Nickel. And you just come right here and click this button, Request Payment. It will send out that email information with that link to pay, and when that payment is settled and completed, you could track it here, but it's also going to automatically update within QuickBooks. So this kind of goes back to one of the reasons I was asking, like, what is top of mind for you when it comes with software implementation? Nickel is not going to be like a whole ERP system or a whole accounting system. It's not going to be like a three-month implementation with several different meetings. It's really going to take one meeting with your accounting team to walk through what I walked through with you in five or 10 minutes. Click the link to QuickBooks, wait two to three minutes, make sure it syncs correctly, and then based on your use case, show them some best practices. From there, you'll be able to operate the same day. Everything will automatically update in both Nickel and in QuickBooks, so you don't have to go through big integration headaches or extra steps in a procedure. It's really just the only extra step is coming and requesting the payment from Nickel and that's going to be saving you 1.75% to 3% per transaction.
Chris' phonr (2): Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: One other little Easter egg we have here, I'm not sure if this would fit for you guys if you wanted to use it. We have these payment portals and these are really customizable. So beyond like you can put your branding and your name in a photo. But you can also put whatever fields you want here. We'll have different customers that use Nickel. You have like three or four different payment portals and they'll just plug it in on their website. Chicago Brass is one of our earliest customers who have been doing this. They'll have this pay invoice button here. You put it wherever you want to. You could ask for the customer name, the project, have them upload a document, whatever you want, and they'll be able to just make the payment automatically from the website.
Chris' phonr (2): This works for some businesses and not others. Wait, you're saying I could put that widget or whatever on my website and.
Jacob Greenberg: They could go to my website and pay?
Chris' phonr (2): Exactly, yep. If they have the invoice number or whatever. Yep.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, that's cool. And they can just, when you click return, they'll just go back to your website.
Chris' phonr (2): So it looks like a seamless experience within your website. Okay, cool. Yeah, that's cool.
Jacob Greenberg: It's a cool tool.
Chris' phonr (2): Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: It's also nice when you're, if you're like in the field trying to get a payment, you can pull it up on your phone.
Chris' phonr (2): Right. Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: Right.
Chris' phonr (2): Okay. Yeah. All right. I think this is kind of a no brainer minus the technology thing that I hate. Well, I'm going to tell you this.
Jacob Greenberg: Right now, Chris, at the end of this experience with this technology thing, you're gonna be like, this was the easiest piece of technology I've ever implemented for my company.
Chris' phonr (2): It definitely seems like, a lot less intimidating than some of the other stuff I'm talking about. But, you know, I just have a lot of bad experiences with it, so.
Jacob Greenberg: That'S why I also added it too.
Chris' phonr (2): So yeah, that's good. Let's set up the next steps.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, cool. So the next steps here would be we can set up a meeting with, and you said, so I know you said you guys have, it's a good time to do this. Do you have a timeline on when you would want this implemented?
Chris' phonr (2): I mean, can we, what's up tomorrow?
Jacob Greenberg: I have availability at 11:00 AM tomorrow or at anytime between 2:00 and 4:00 PM tomorrow.
Chris' phonr (2): 11:00 would be pretty good because I have a meeting with the bookkeeper and everybody every Wednesday at 10:00. So then I could talk to them and hopefully arrange it so that we can all talk. Should we all be on this next call?
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, that would probably be ideal. This way we can get a full demo for everybody. We could get the integration set up and we could begin with some test transactions or we could set you guys up. You could do some test transactions for that week period and we'll have a follow up call the next week just to check in, make sure everything's going well.
Chris' phonr (2): That'd be great. Let's try to do that. And then I'll so what we'll do is I'll go through my weekly call with the bookkeeping team and my office administration, let them know that we're going to try to connect with you afterwards and try to get everybody on board with that. If you could send me a Zoom that I could, how do I do that to get everybody in on this Zoom with you?
Jacob Greenberg: So I could send you the Zoom invite. You can go into it and add emails on your own, or if you would like, if you have trouble with that, Just shoot me an email with the other details you want me to include and I'll add them for you.
Chris' phonr (2): So during my meeting tomorrow, I'll just send you an email with the other addresses to add to the Zoom while we're in the meeting at between 10:00 and 11:00 and you'll add them and then we'll jump on the call at 11:00.
Jacob Greenberg: Yep, exactly.
Chris' phonr (2): Okay, hopefully that'll work. Are you busy between 10:00 and 11:00?
Jacob Greenberg: For what reason? Like if you need to ask us.
Chris' phonr (2): I'm saying because if we could jump on a call at 10:45, it might be better. How long do you think this call will take?
Jacob Greenberg: It takes 30 to 45 minutes. And that's being generous. Like I don't think we'll need the entire time, but it's nice.
Chris' phonr (2): Because I know the bookkeeping team's going to need to jump too, but if we could jump, if we can get on a call at 10:45 after I talk to them and do our thing, that might be better.
Jacob Greenberg: Let's just set it for 10:45 then. Okay. That's fine.
Chris' phonr (2): Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay. I just sent you the calendar invite. It should have a Zoom link in there so that you're ready to hop on tomorrow. And you can send me any of the emails you want to join our call before tomorrow and I'll add them to the event as well.
Chris' phonr (2): Okay. Awesome.
Jacob Greenberg: All right, Chris.
Chris' phonr (2): And that's, you just emailed that to me.
Jacob Greenberg: Was that?
Chris' phonr (2): Yep.
Jacob Greenberg: I just sent it in an email.
Chris' phonr (2): Gotcha.
Jacob Greenberg: It might take a second to come in.
Chris' phonr (2): Gotcha. I got it here. And we're signed up. Yes. All right. All right. All right. So sweet. I'll talk to you tomorrow. Sounds good.
Jacob Greenberg: All right. Talk to you tomorrow, Chris.
