Christian Sheerer: I did, but we can go through them now. I didn't. That's weird that I didn't though. Let me just.
Matt Fischer: Weird. Adobe did a share thing, so.
Christian Sheerer: Oh yeah, I don't even. Oh, okay.
Matt Fischer: Who knows?
Christian Sheerer: Actually, I do see it. I do see it. Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool. Yeah, I don't usually use it Acrobat on this computer, but I'm familiar with it, so that makes sense. Okay, cool.
Matt Fischer: Just a little easier to throw notes in. Yep.
Christian Sheerer: Cool. Awesome. Okay. I mean, yeah, we can review. I think it would be too kind of like laborious to go through it on the call. And I can. We can. I can follow up asynchronously about these. I think it's just more so on our side to kind of validate that kind of workflow. And were there glaring sort of misconceptions that I had about the flowchart there or that we should clear up now or is it generally in the right spot?
Matt Fischer: The only thing that is so Pilot Games. Yeah, not a huge difference. They are actually kind of above us. Okay. They send us all the reports. My job is pretty easy. Once I put the customers up, I take my cut. They do all the reporting. They do all the real work. So money comes from the non profits to us. We send uphill their portion to Pilot Games. Yeah, nice. But all reports come from them. And so like the report, how much does a bar. Oh. Comes from them. Okay, then down below, where was it? Non profit distribution accounts payable. You have that from Alaska Wholesale. Money from Alaska Wholesale. We really want to try to avoid that coming into our bank account. We really want to try to make it.
Christian Sheerer: Yes, yes. But yeah, that is.
Matt Fischer: Well, as that's.
Christian Sheerer: How are you interpreting that? That is coming from. So in basically that's coming from the bar account.
Matt Fischer: Right. So straight from. You'd put the bar. But I guess it is coming from the bar just down below in your color coding says money from Alaska Wholesale should be money from bars.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Matt Fischer: Yes.
Christian Sheerer: Sorry.
Matt Fischer: Sorry, sorry.
Christian Sheerer: Good note. Got it. Yeah, that's my bad. That is money from. That's me not double checking what the Legend had in relation to the actual flow. Because in the flow it's like, okay, this is sort of the account structure operation center and then bar account and then the 40 to cool. Yeah, I'll just make a. I'll make a clear note of that for us. But yeah, that, that, that's how it. It would function. And that's possible. We would just have to have those. Those bar accounts.
Matt Fischer: Right.
Christian Sheerer: As as we talked about last time.
Matt Fischer: From us going uphill to pilot. So we'll, we'll, we'll be using you guys to send our ACH2 pilot. So that's okay.
Christian Sheerer: And do they have to, do they have a desire or is it necessary for them to have a nickel accounts receivable kind of connection?
Matt Fischer: I don't think so. I, I can. Here's where I see this going. And I don't want to commit them to this. Okay. Yeah. Working. Well, I can see them trying to get legislation in Minnesota that they do the same thing. Because right now the, the nonprofits literally have to walk bar to bar and pick up receipts on a weekly basis. It's crazy. And so I think if we can model this. Well now in Minnesota you're talking. Their revenue is over 280 million per year. Yeah. And so it's like if we can get a decent model, I can see this going to other states like that because this just makes it so much easier for a nonprofit and that's kind of what it's about. So. Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, that's okay.
Matt Fischer: That makes sense.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah.
Matt Fischer: I just wanted to.
Christian Sheerer: Double tap on that.
Matt Fischer: Yeah. And there's, and there's. So there is another one too. So there are some non profits that run their own stores, their own full tap stores, their own bingo balls. They would be paying us directly. So there's no bar.
Christian Sheerer: So let me share this real quick so I can just move my mouse in the way that you're describing. So I remember.
Matt Fischer: So.
Christian Sheerer: So this one. So you're saying there is. There will. There will basically be a similar branching like this one from here.
Matt Fischer: Yes. So instead of that bar account, it would just be a non profit would be on that level or.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, cool.
Matt Fischer: Last. Also non profit. They would skip the bar and 33%.
Christian Sheerer: Comes to us and then they keep 70.
Matt Fischer: They keep 70, right.
Christian Sheerer: Or 67.
Matt Fischer: Whatever. Yeah, whatever.
Christian Sheerer: The.
Matt Fischer: Okay, cool, cool.
Christian Sheerer: So pilot games doesn't necessarily. I mean we would love to, you know, have them, but for the purpose of this like initial.
Matt Fischer: Evaluation. Right. Just being able to send money out, that's all we need.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, yeah. And you can. I mean people pay vendors that have no idea what nickel is until they get a bill from their customer via nickel all the time. And we would like to have them too on the platform, but you know, not necessary. So. Cool. That narrows the focus down. Okay. And so with those kind of changes, I think that would be suitable where. And then I'll just double check on all these things and make sure there's no, like, glaring, based on your responses, glaring things that we have to smooth over. I think we just wanted this as documentation for guidance on how we would go about it, rather than like, you know, method of trying to disqualify or anything.
Matt Fischer: Yep.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, so then from there, where, where. What do you need from us? Basically, from. From this point on, outside of the. An updated version of this that is a little bit cleaner and more accurate.
Matt Fischer: The only, the only things that I saw on here, I didn't know what you meant by partial payments.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. So if an invoice is paid out. So like, if an invoice is paid out is not completed and paid out, meaning if there's a $10,000 invoice and only $8,000 is paid out against it.
Matt Fischer: They'D be off.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, so there won't be any partial payments.
Matt Fischer: Yeah, there's.
Christian Sheerer: There's no scenario in which a partial payment would happen.
Matt Fischer: No.
Christian Sheerer: Okay. And.
Matt Fischer: And the other one was, you know, audit control or disputes, they'd have to take that up with the state because the numbers that we report are state numbers. So it's again, with a dispute, there's literally no disputes. So I don't know if that's the answer you guys are looking for, but.
Christian Sheerer: No, that's just.
Matt Fischer: There's not really a method because it just doesn't happen. Okay.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. I mean, because all of these are mainly that, that, that is sort of in the off chance that somebody pays.
Matt Fischer: On.
Christian Sheerer: Credit or something or the. So they're, they're. Or, or they, you know, they dispute that they didn't get maybe software or pull tabs, etc. They didn't get it delivered, and so they paid for it up front and they didn't get it delivered. And so then there would be a return or an insufficient funds sort of charge back almost.
Matt Fischer: Can you. I'm going to sound stupid here with ach, can there be insufficient funds?
Christian Sheerer: I mean, we will. It's basically like we'll pull the funds and then we'll have to send it back.
Matt Fischer: So there's essentially, there's like a. So what? So here's what I'm asked. So I have a report. Joe's Bar paid Sue's nonprofit. So I see that that payment's been made. But if there was insufficient funds.
Christian Sheerer: Then Sue's nonprofit will. Will send back whatever was paid because it, it would be a failed transaction.
Matt Fischer: Okay. But that's usually very few and far between.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, very few and far between. And we do have a backstop way in which we can Require them to log in to their bank when they initiate an ach so that they have to see, oh, I do have sufficient funds for this.
Matt Fischer: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: And so we can add that in on it. And again, that is turned on maybe 1% of customers. That's an inaccurate number, but very, very few and far between. People turn that on because they'd rather just, they'd rather just get their money on time.
Matt Fischer: Right. I just want to make sure if I'm telling the state this nonprofit's been paid that that information is accurate. And could it be an insufficient funds case?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, I mean it would be the, the turnaround time on that would be within like one or two business days between when it. Yeah. So you would, you would have ample time to be able to have a report that we could make sure is reconciled that is like actually was paid. Right? Yeah.
Matt Fischer: Yeah. So I guess, you know, as we go forward, again, just knowing from you guys this is possible, I'll probably, I just set up a nickel account here. Just we'll pay our vendors just so we can get familiar with it, see what it looks like. Yeah. Just that way we have hands on knowledge of what a customer would see when they're trying to pay.
Christian Sheerer: I think that is exactly right. And do you have bills ready to go? Basically? Do you have a timeline on when you would send out a bill? So that we could set up a, you know, sort of a. We do it like you guys as the nucleus. Right. And all right. We're going to make sure it's operational and then as we start to spread the octopus which is represented in the flowchart form, we're doing that accurately. Which is a unique scenario.
Matt Fischer: Right.
Christian Sheerer: Like we talked about, where you're having one account for Alaska Wholesale. So the, the flow chart is like a payments flow, but also sort of like an account structure thing. Right. Where you have these operations bar. Operation center bar basically, or nonprofit underneath as those sub accounts where they will have their ability to log in individually as your. We call them clients for today.
Matt Fischer: So that, that brings me. One of the questions I did have is going through your thing. So the QuickBooks structure, how are individual bars tracked? Would I need to have the bars in mine, my books? If so, in my brain we're sending a CSV file or whatever API that sends. Somehow we're sending to you guys this or into the, to the nickel world. Out of that comes a message to the bar saying you need to pay bar X, Y and Z. Hopefully coming from that report that we're not having to input into QuickBooks. Each account for the bars and who the bar has to pay is that.
Christian Sheerer: No. Yeah, they would have their own books.
Matt Fischer: Okay. So that. That's the question was, how are individual bars tracked? Class locations and projects. As my customer, I have the non profits because they're directly paying me. They would show.
Christian Sheerer: So you would have customers. And. And so when you're paying the.
Matt Fischer: The.
Christian Sheerer: The bars would technically be customers if they're paying you in accounts receivable.
Matt Fischer: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: The non profits are your client.
Matt Fischer: Right. Okay.
Christian Sheerer: They're. You're paying. Sorry. The nonprofits are your vendor because you're paying them out to them.
Matt Fischer: Well, I'm not even paying them. The bars are paying me on behalf.
Christian Sheerer: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So, exactly. They're individual.
Matt Fischer: So, okay.
Christian Sheerer: Each client would have its own chart of accounts. And ultimately that's like if they want to capture it with us because. Meaning if they want to sync it up with us, they could have all their transactions live in the CSV in nickel, exported, and do whatever they want with it, really. But for Alaska Wholesale, your individual chart of accounts would be linked up to it with both customers that you have in desktop that are paying you on an accounts receivable side, and then vendors that you are paying out on an accounts payable that would be linked up. And then the bars would have their own individual ones, different charts of accounts. Right. Because they don't share the Alaska Wholesale chart of accounts. And then the nonprofits would have their own individual ones that have their own chart of accounts.
Matt Fischer: Okay, so could you guys create just a fictitious screenshot type of. If this is going, what would it look like? You know, the bar gets this message at the end of the month to pay these nonprofits. What I'd like to be able to show the senator is like, okay, this is what the bar is going to see. This is the actions that they would have to take. And this is how we can prove that payment has been received by the nonprofits.
Christian Sheerer: Yep. Yeah, I can do that.
Matt Fischer: That's what I need to give them that. Like you said, the eye trail. How can the state prove. How can I give the state that confidence that the non profits have actually been paid and I'm not some shady guy taking all the money.
Christian Sheerer: Yep, absolutely. I mean, and that.
Matt Fischer: That'll.
Christian Sheerer: That'll live in nickel. The only way that QuickBooks comes into it is if people. You're using that as their ERP and they want to settle it in QuickBooks.
Matt Fischer: Right.
Christian Sheerer: Because that's just a better ERP system.
Matt Fischer: We're not investing convenience.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. You know, they might have, they might be doing it on a spreadsheet. They might just have like, you know, bar accountant, somebody's wife or cousin or whatever. And then they would just pull the transaction history from nickel. The syncing with QuickBooks is like if something is completed, paid, done, dusted in nickel, then it's also going to be done dusted in their ERP. QuickBooks.
Matt Fischer: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: And so.
Matt Fischer: So QuickBooks Online does essentially free for nonprofits.
Christian Sheerer: We have a. Yeah. Native API integration of QuickBooks Online.
Matt Fischer: Okay, good deal. Yeah, I think you know that. And then kind of, you know, obviously we're a long ways away, but, you know, just as you guys are looking at price structure a little bit more, kind of keep me in the. What your thoughts are on that.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, I think this is helpful for, for scoping that out. And I can give just a general range based on the answers that you gave to technical validation on the second page and the updated stuff that we just discussed basically today as well as the new just edits to that flowchart. And so I can give a general range plus a. I can go into like a nickel account and show a fictitious kind of like transaction set that will. So Most people have QuickBooks in their chart of accounts as the source of truth for all payments. Right. And their payment portal, which is nickel, they link up to it so that anything that's transacted and completed within nickel is back and updated in their source of truth, which is QuickBooks. All that is to say for Senator, for whoever needs to know, hey, Matt Fisher is making sure that everything is kind of paid out to the bars and the non profits who are vendors and we're receiving money from the, from the bars as customers that all lives in nickel as well, like in, in the transactions. And you can toggle between paid out and received. So suffice to say that stuff will live in historical record in nickel as well.
Matt Fischer: Okay. Yeah, yeah. And then we'll see when what's your guys, you'd said you're looking at desktop integration. Do you guys have a kind of a timeline your goal for that?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, I mean just in general.
Matt Fischer: Not for this.
Christian Sheerer: No, I would, I would put us on a hard goal in general by the end of, by the turn of the year. And it's possible we get. It's become. We're actually on a trip together, so we're all in close quarters and it's become constant kind of talking point, so likely that it could get accelerated. But I think the general consensus is like by the turn of the year, it needs to be something that we have.
Matt Fischer: Okay. And then I guess the other one too. This will be big for Pilot. If you guys young company, do you have like a general this is who we are type of thing?
Christian Sheerer: I absolutely.
Matt Fischer: I don't know a bunch about you guys, but I think you're kind of like John's private Pilot, John Weaver's privately owned company. They're a no debt company. Just pretty incredible.
Christian Sheerer: Nice. Yeah.
Matt Fischer: And I just want to give them that comfort level of hey, we're matching up with somebody who's not going to give us a bad reputation.
Christian Sheerer: Absolutely. Yeah. We can cover all the bases there. I think that covers like founding story, what we're set up to do, why we're set up to handle things like this as well as like security in a sentence. It's like what our main goal was was to be able to make heavy duty payments. Right. It was targeted around industrial businesses because those were the payments that were mostly paper based. And no tech platform that process payments was built to do those cheaply. Because all the tech platforms that process payments are like, hey, we just want to be card processors and skim as much money off the top of a transaction as we can. And we figured, hey, we could build a lot of trust by making like large ACH payments go through rather quickly and cheaply and then build things on top of that infrastructure which we're doing. And so because of that, because of the investment in the technology to be able to move a large payment across cheaply and quickly, we had to invest in way higher security than like a company that would just be. And create all these fraud risk models and what have you than a company that would just be moving $500 invoices at a high volume. Right. In companies like those like payments platforms like those like a stripe, like a bill.com, stuff like that, they will like delay a large payment because it's out of the ordinary for them. Right. It's like not built into the model or it's not compatible with the model that they have of building around small transactions. And so I think that type of summary would be probably useful for Pilot games, also useful for us to get dialed in on. And so I can, I can create kind of like a one pager forum.
Matt Fischer: Yeah, just kind of our industry on the manufacturer side, every major paper manufacturer for pull tabs has now been cyber hacked, taken hostage. Our biggest supplier is currently there right now. So it's like the industry is ripe with people looking.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, I mean, we deal with it all the time.
Matt Fischer: There's money there. Not realizing we don't hold the cash. We're not on that side of it. But anyway, so you got us definitely big and.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, yeah, we deal with that all the time. I mean, that's, that's, that's something that's top of mind for us all the time is fraud risk, especially because we have to earn the trust of people who are in industries where they've been comfortable taking checks for a long time, but, like, comfortable only on the security side and because it's been typical for them, but uncomfortable because of just like the arduousness of, you know, basically the source of what we've been talking about. Right. Like, it's like, hey, we're now in the 21st century. I have to fly across Alaska to don't, like drop off a check, you know, to a particular place, like drive, you know, across Minnesota to do it.
Matt Fischer: Yeah, yeah. So I think, you know, if you can get me. Top, top priority would be getting me what this would look like to the non profits and the bars so I can show the senator that, hey, here it is. This is secured. Yeah, it's a change. It's not the normal path that money takes currently, but it will, It'll keep everybody honest and there's documentation to show that everybody's honest in this whole thing. That way we can get legal department writing that into the statutes and get it approved. Brilliant. Okay, cool. At some point, you know, once we get. If I got him on board, I'll probably get with John and that just to make sure we're all, like I said, it's. It's their reputation ultimately on the line. So I want to make sure he's comfortable and I, I think he will be. They. They've got a good team. One of your questions was about integration. They've got programmers that are out of this world. They'll match whatever you guys need for integration side of it.
Christian Sheerer: Cool. Yeah, I think, I think that would be. So what you just said, in the short term and then that bit of a programmer to programmer speak. And we can have either our CTO or somebody on the compliance side who also is close to the actual building of the tech side. Everybody's close to everything here, but more on the technical ins and outs. We can set that up for when their team wants to get involved.
Matt Fischer: Okay, cool. Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: All right.
Matt Fischer: Well, I appreciate it. And you, anything else you need from us or.
Christian Sheerer: No, I will let you know as it comes up though, I'll just go through, do a deeper dive on the answers that you gave and formulate them up for us and then we can handle that like on email asynchronously. Did you. We want to put a target of when we'd get back together after. I can get you that stuff and kind of take the next step towards the legal compliance if you want.
Matt Fischer: Just kind of saying we get November again.
Christian Sheerer: Okay.
Matt Fischer: And then December is just a shit show around here. So.
Christian Sheerer: Physically and. And in work you think?
Matt Fischer: Yeah, it just. The legislators are getting ready to go and they don't want to do any business because they're going to be going the next four months. So.
Christian Sheerer: Cool.
Matt Fischer: They kind of shut down.
Christian Sheerer: So should we try for I guess a month from now?
Matt Fischer: Yeah, yeah, whatever works for you. November ish.
Christian Sheerer: There and yeah, I'll send one for the same time on. On the 7th of November which is a Friday.
Matt Fischer: Let's go back it back half a couple days. I've got a sixth, seventh, eighth. I've got some stuff going on. Okay, cool.
Christian Sheerer: Let's do the. The. You want to do the 10th on a Monday?
Matt Fischer: Yeah, that'll work. Okay, cool.
Christian Sheerer: I'll send it for the same time and I'll get that stuff over to you hopefully by the end of the week, if not early next week.
Matt Fischer: Okay, thank you.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, no problem.
Matt Fischer: Appreciate your time.
Christian Sheerer: Just chatting with you again. Yeah, you too.
Matt Fischer: We'll see it too.
Christian Sheerer: Sa.
