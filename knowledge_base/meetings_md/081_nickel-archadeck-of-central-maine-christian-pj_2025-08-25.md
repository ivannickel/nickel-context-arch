Christian Sheerer: And that's why I wrote that on the invite.
T.J. Langerak: Oh, gotcha.
Christian Sheerer: Sorry about that.
T.J. Langerak: No problem.
Christian Sheerer: I saw you hop in. I'm like, oh, no, not PJ.
T.J. Langerak: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: Nice to meet you. I'm glad to connect.
T.J. Langerak: How are you going? Nice to meet you as well. Cool.
Christian Sheerer: So I know you did speak with Jacob. He reached out because we had.
T.J. Langerak: A.
Christian Sheerer: Couple of different franchisees kind of sign up in the wake of the retreat that was going on. I don't think you weren't there, were you?
T.J. Langerak: I didn't make it.
Christian Sheerer: No.
T.J. Langerak: Okay, cool.
Christian Sheerer: And so the gist of it was, I think, Ryan.
T.J. Langerak: Ryan Pope. Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: In Virginia, I think, is where he's at. Or Northern Indianapolis.
T.J. Langerak: Yeah. Northern Indianapolis.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, yeah. One of the first ones that came in after him was from Virginia, so I'm getting those mixed up.
T.J. Langerak: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: Northern Indianapolis. and gave a presentation on us, and we think it might be a good fit for kind of people who are doing business in the way that you guys are typically. And so, like, the goal of this call is to get a little bit deeper on the platform, learn more about your business and how we might help you make the most of it, and tighten up some screws on, like, the payments operation side. And then maybe we play around with, like, sending a transaction. in the hopes of, you know, down the line, we can help figure out after this, right, how you'd help make the most of it. So I'm curious, I guess, like, give me the spread of one, I guess, your knowledge of Nickel, and then two, how you guys currently handle payments, both on the AR and AP side.
T.J. Langerak: So. We use QuickBooks Online for, for, AR. And yeah, we just send the invoice out from QuickBooks and they have the option to either do a transfer or send a check. I typically don't take a credit card just because they take too much margin away from me. And then as far as AP goes, you know, we just we typically, you know, a lot of our vendors, we can just pay online like my, my where I, you know, my biggest material supplier, I just pay with a credit card every month for the rewards points mostly. Yeah. And other, we have other vendors that we just mail checked. And.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, so we'll split up those. to conversations into separate buckets, but I think the overall thesis is we can put them together in one spot. That's sort of what we've did without having to replace like an ERP, like QuickBooks Online. We actually just link up to it rather than replacing the ERP. That's what they do. They sort of added payments as like a, and you recognized it, right? Sort of like a thing that they could earn a little bit of a QuickBooks on if people are just wanting to run payments and not think about it. And so you're sending out an invoice through there. And do you disable the credit card or?
T.J. Langerak: Yep. Okay.
Christian Sheerer: And that's because what are those fees look like when you didn't disable them?
T.J. Langerak: So 3%.
Christian Sheerer: 3%.
T.J. Langerak: Yep.
Christian Sheerer: And you weren't able to push that. to the, to the sending of money end.
T.J. Langerak: Right.
Christian Sheerer: To your customers.
T.J. Langerak: I'm sorry.
Christian Sheerer: You weren't able to push that to the sending them.
T.J. Langerak: Oh. I have before. You know, I basically just said, look, if it's really important to you to use your credit card, you know, maybe we'll split the, split the fee, you know, or stuff, something like that, because some people, they really need to use their credit card and. so we, I've done that. I'll work with people if it's really important to them. Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: And what was the reason you'd split it is because they were like, oh, I need to use my credit card, but I'm not going to pay three percent.
T.J. Langerak: I think I was just trying to, this hasn't been that often. I'm thinking of one instance.
Christian Sheerer: Oh, okay.
T.J. Langerak: And I think what we did, I said, look, I'm willing to absorb it on the first payment you covered on the next. Three. So I think that's the deal that we, we worked out this particular customer. And the funny thing is, it was important to her because she was, she trying to get rewards points. But I felt like saying, look, you know, three percent, you're not getting three percent rewards. You know what I mean? That's more than what you're gonna get in rewards, you know? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Christian Sheerer: I mean, I don't know, sometimes people have good deals with their cards. And sort of our philosophy on it, and you'll see pretty quickly when I get into the platform of how we let your customers interface with Nickel is give them the options in a way that's advantageous for you. So we have a way that because we're handling as a service the transaction between y'all, one that does a lot of benefits for security, right? Ryan was telling us stories about him driving around with checks in his car. And then there's a lot of added like PCI compliance stuff that we're handling on your behalf. So, and we're also making each invoice direct to one transaction. So we're not batching them as sometimes QuickBooks payments does. So there's like a risk of co-mingling funds. So that's one aspect of it. But then in a way that's advantageous for you by passing on because we're handling the service without tripping the wires on any surcharging laws by state. I'm not familiar. I should get the 50 states, you know, breaking down, broken down in my head about it. I'm not familiar with how Maine handles it, but because we're handling the service, we can just put that 3% on them without you having to have that extra negotiation. And then if you need to have a negotiation where you do split it, we have that option in the tech where you can like split it for the first one, maybe the second, third, fourth. And I know all the Archadeck, at least the ones that I've spoken to, you guys have like four payment. process per project. It's like upfront walk through construction and then post.
T.J. Langerak: Yeah, very close. It's the upfront project start, substantial completion, which basically means the carpenters are done, and then the final 10% after everything's cleaned up and the project is completely closed. Cool.
Christian Sheerer: And so you, you, okay, so that's a little bit different on the percentages than I've heard before. And that's cool because we can customize it particular to TJ and Maine.
T.J. Langerak: Right.
Christian Sheerer: That's going to be a nice thing. And, and so if you want to split up the card or you just want to push them to ACH on the, and sort of to round out that thought is like, people will pick the one that's most advantageous for the customer. We sort of want to make it foolproof for your customers to pay you.
T.J. Langerak: Right.
Christian Sheerer: So that you just have cash coming in on the ACH stuff when you get a wire or or an ACH transfer via QuickBooks, are they taking a cut on that? I know they've like you bumped it up to like 1% recently.
T.J. Langerak: Yeah, they take a percentage up to $10. I believe is what it is right now.
Christian Sheerer: Is it $10?
T.J. Langerak: Jericho, did it go up? Oh, it's 20 now, she said. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So it's a percentage. But it stops at 20 bucks.
Christian Sheerer: Per each one.
T.J. Langerak: Per each one.
Christian Sheerer: Split across the four.
T.J. Langerak: Okay, cool.
Christian Sheerer: And are you guys sending out one invoice for those four and they're just paying it at different intervals? Are you sending an invoice for upfront and then substantial completion separate each time?
T.J. Langerak: Yes. Cool.
Christian Sheerer: How many projects are you guys running roughly every month?
T.J. Langerak: In a month, we would typically start four projects probably. Cool. Yep.
Christian Sheerer: And so it's like, are you, and then does that stack up at any interval throughout the year? Meaning like you might get more payments in and payments out to vendors one month to the next, or is it like four or four for, for, for at throughout the 12 month?
T.J. Langerak: Yeah, no, I think it kind of stacks up, especially, you know, this time of year, we're getting a lot of production in, and then it'll slow down in the wintertime, everything will get caught up. Cool. Yep. Cool.
Christian Sheerer: Awesome. I think, I mean, that's good context on, on the business. I think I feel like I have enough to kind of like, show you, which is a very light solution. So it's like not replacing anything except for the QuickBooks payments piece, right? You're not going to have to rip out QuickBooks online. What they do well is building ERPs, and that's like how they grew their business and got, I think it was like Intuit acquired them or something. And then that's what they focus on. And so we want you to continue to focus on that and we'll just link up with the QuickBooks online so that the invoice creation and the payments handling is done in our system, which just has like a deeper architecture to handle large payments. Do you ever have payments like above 25,000? I know that might be typical.
T.J. Langerak: Not commonly, but like we do. I mean, I think Jerica just sent an invoice out for corn, substantial completion for corn, that must be close to 50,000, right? Yeah, 48-6. 48-6.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, and I think the reason I get into that is just because of the philosophy of how we started.
T.J. Langerak: Where.
Christian Sheerer: We found most softwares that are handling payments are built for these really small types of quick transactions. And so if I use a stripe or something or whatever to send 200 bucks or a monthly subscription of 20 bucks or a yearly subscription of 300, cool, I don't really need to go into to approve it. I just have my bank account information there. But we actually ran into a funny thing where we were paying one of our vendors, I think it was Zoom or something, we had to pay them substantial amount of money. And then our founder had to go in, log into his bank account, had to multi-factor identification and Stripe, multi-factor and Zoom. And so like a payment of $20,000, not really crazy in your industry. took like five days to settle, even though it was all electronic payment. It wasn't like a check that takes, you know, 10 days just to go through the normal processing time. And so we saw that opportunity and we were like, okay, if we could just build a deep payments infrastructure with a pretty simple sleek, like getting on to the platform, which should take around a day or a couple hours really, then we could solve a lot of problems, right? We'd save a lot of people's time and then also not have to, kind of if you're dealing with somebody who's a little bit lower as like a vendor or they don't have to go through the whole multi-factor authentication on their end. And we can handle like a, you know, we handle payments upwards of hundreds of thousands of dollars up to a million. And so that's sort of why we think through it that way, is to have like a secure way to get these large transactions done without eating up too much time. And so when I get paid, which is like on the receivable end, all this stuff is going to be real time and that's meaning like within a couple minutes on QuickBooks. So if I'm making an invoice on QuickBooks and I've already linked it in my account settings, that's just gonna pull into Nickel right away and vice versa. So the information that's relevant to your ERP, which we'll map over, gets paid out in nickel, invoice gets cleared and then pushed into QuickBooks. So when I go and do get paid, I can send one here and I'll go to like Chris eight. And you guys are, you have some like standard operating procedure of setting these up in QuickBooks for each of the four ones that you're tracking against some project management software?
T.J. Langerak: Yeah, it's basically, not really, it's just we're a pretty small office. It's basically Jeriker and I talk and she does all the invoicing. And, you know, she knows she's aware of what, what the point of all the projects is that, you know, where they're at. And she'll just ask them, can I, you know, time to send one for substantial completion here or whatever. It's just us talking to each other and yeah, Cool.
Christian Sheerer: And most of them are just one time, right? One time invoices are not recurring. Awesome. And so yeah, then this will be a super light lift for y'all because it's usually the most time I have to spend explaining how to use Nickel is like just meeting people where they're at in their own process. And so because of like the lightweight nature of yalls, you can probably just like spin up around the next couple of transactions super simply because it's like, okay, cool. We're at this point in project for Chris eight and I'm my fake customer in my fake environment. I'll send that one-time invoice. I can track it against a future due date or on the exact same day if you want to find it and you can track when things are overdue. If they pay half of it, you'll see a balance owed against that invoice. They'll see it as well. And then you can upload, do you guys have like one agreement for the four different payments for the project?
T.J. Langerak: Yes. Okay, cool.
Christian Sheerer: I might, if I were you, upload that in there because then when they see, when I show you here, the secure payment link notification to get paid in their email or in their phone, they'll see exactly for that document, like what it's for and what it's tied to. That's also just good for you guys on the back end. So I'll send it out to myself, and then in another tab.
T.J. Langerak: I'll pull.
Christian Sheerer: Up hopefully that sent already.
T.J. Langerak: Cool.
Christian Sheerer: And then this is what they'll see on their end. So in the background of my logic in my demo environment as De Graa distribution sending a bill to Christian, I've said, okay, all the credit card fees, if they want to pay by credit card, great, like, you know, whatever their reason for achieving the benefits of paying via credit card are, Not really my business, but I'll give them those options. And you can pop in here, put their details, or pay by bank, put routing account number. And because we're able to handle it, it should go after they verified that we can pull funds from them. Every time after that, it'll go quickly. Two-day turnaround on ACH, one-day turnaround on credit card.
T.J. Langerak: No? Okay. Just a side note, I don't believe that we are allowed to upcharge for credit cards technically for a law in Maine. Cool.
Christian Sheerer: And so yeah, this is a good way to do that with or, you know, pass the fee on, right, without up charging. So the way the law, like surcharging works is, oh, if I have to upcharge on the 10,000, so now they have to pay like 10,300 for the project, which was agreed upon to be 10,000.
T.J. Langerak: Right?
Christian Sheerer: Now I'm tripping over the wire of that surcharging. And so we have a good blog about the surcharging laws in every state. And because we're handling that transaction, that 3% can get applied, and you still receive the full amount without having to go in and Make an extra line item on the invoice. And yeah.
T.J. Langerak: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: And if you wanted to too.
T.J. Langerak: And.
Christian Sheerer: I would probably, based on what I'm hearing from you, my suggestion would probably be like set and forget it, right? Like have it just be 2.99% on their end. But if you wanted to per customer or globally, meaning for everybody, you could always come in and you can't do 150, but you could always come in and split it 50/50 or do it, you know? Per invoice or per customer, whatever you want.
T.J. Langerak: Mm-. Yep. Gotcha. Okay. Looks good.
Christian Sheerer: Awesome. And so it's like four months. So you guys have, and then when those customers are done, they're with their four, they're pretty much done unless they're setting up a new project with y'all. Do you ever have like returning customers? I know that seems, oh cool. Okay, awesome. And so you'll be able to store them all here. Right, so I can see if Chris 2 didn't pay, you know, I'll see the balance that's overdue on his, how much he's paid out, what active invoices there are. So if, you know, I have that one active invoice for substantial completion, then I can go in and see all the payments that he's made. So if I had like the one for upfront, the two for substantial completion, the three four, what was the third one again?
T.J. Langerak: The third one's actually substantial completion. You get down payment and project start. Okay, cool, cool.
Christian Sheerer: All right, so down payment, project start, substantial completion, and then, okay, we have this like final one, the fourth one, final walk through outstanding. And so I can always manipulate. So you have the two different views are doing the same thing. Right, like one thing is like I'm sending an invoice and I'm just tracking on my invoice. I don't know if Jerika does it that way or if she does it by customer. And so I can still see all of these by customer and say, okay, let's check in where Chris 3 is at. Let's check in where Adina is at. Let's check in where ANR Wholesale is at.
T.J. Langerak: Yeah, I like that. Across the projects that they owe to me. You do it on a spreadsheet, don't you, Jerika? It's in Smartsheet. Either in Smartsheet I don't or in. Know if you can hear her. Probably not.
Christian Sheerer: I did, I did, I did. So Smartsheet, is that just a, that's just like a Excel type?
T.J. Langerak: Yeah, it's like Excel, but it's more geared toward project management. It's pretty much what the whole architect system uses. Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: I know there, and so that would be, so again, like project management softwares too, I think there's a world five years down the line where we, you know, 'cause we're really going in for industrial small businesses, builders, material suppliers, all this stuff. And so we know that world well. So there might be a lot, a place six, whatever, five years down the line where we start to run all that stuff because our thesis is like payments are the lifeblood of any business, right? And if we do the industrial business as well, we can think about how those other things are. But for the time being, we're not replacing those. We would probably just replace that manual process of having to then look at Smartsheet and then create another invoice in QuickBooks and then try to do it in another way to avoid those fees. We would just be taking in that QuickBooks payments bit and taking it out so that she doesn't have to manually track, okay, I created an invoice for here, or if she's manually tracking it, that time goes down from like 30 minutes to manage all three of those softwares to like five to be like, oh, I just pop into Nickel to get the visibility on what the customers are doing per their invoices and then push that into Smartsheet pretty quickly. Yeah, that's what this is here.
T.J. Langerak: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: And also, yeah, happy to split this up into, like, conversations where if, if somebody needs to get familiarized with it, it's super intuitive to the point where.
T.J. Langerak: It looks pretty easy.
Christian Sheerer: As you can imagine, we do with a lot of people who are like, oh, I only do checks and my customers only do checks. They're stuck in 1994 or whatever, and they turn around. And I'm always surprised at how this is. This is a silly thing for, like, a young person to say, right? It's like, oh, I'm always surprised at how the old people figure out the tech super quickly, but it's. It's not that much to figure out.
T.J. Langerak: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: I've sold software where it's like, I tell people at a previous job, hey, you guys need four weeks to implement this with nickel. It's like, probably four weeks to get the most out of it and get everything wrapped around it, but you set it up and. two hours. And so that's like a nice thing and being here.
T.J. Langerak: That's probably about what it took us to implement SmartSheet.
Christian Sheerer: Nice. Oh, four weeks. Yeah.
T.J. Langerak: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: No, some of these like really high built out ones, you know, you need like somebody walking you through it. So we're happy to do that as well too.
T.J. Langerak: Right.
Christian Sheerer: And split it up and like, I talked to a lot of people who are like, okay, owner like yourself will come in, they get an understanding of it. They're like, great, that looks good. Let me pass you on to the controller who's actually going to be manipulating the system. And so that's sort of how we take it piece by piece. I don't even think of myself as somebody trying to get people to use a platform. It's just like, how do we make the most of it? How do I implement it?
T.J. Langerak: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: And so that's the AR side. On the vendors, the vendors, I assume, are less than the number of customers that you guys have.
T.J. Langerak: Yeah. Overall. Yeah. They. Because they kind of build up over time. Right. But, you know, any, any one job that would have, we would typically have, like, a material supplier, and then we got our dumpster, Portageon, and. Some. Subcontractors. And you might have another probably materials are going to be split up to just two different sources a lot of times. So we got five or six people that we're paying on every job, but they're the same ones.
Christian Sheerer: Same ones.
T.J. Langerak: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: Nice. Portageon. And then the last one was subcontractors.
T.J. Langerak: Yep. Cool.
Christian Sheerer: And it sounds like now the method of paying them is up to them.
T.J. Langerak: Kind of. Yeah, yeah, I would say this.
Christian Sheerer: Kind of. What's the other side of the kind of?
T.J. Langerak: Well, this. I would say definitely the subs. You know, I got certain guys that don't like to use, like, a payment app or. Or whatever. They prefer to come and get a check. Whatever works for them, I'm fine with. But, like, my biggest material supplier, which is Hammond Lumber. they don't really care how I pay. I just pay with a credit card.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, it's interesting. Sometimes it's like the opposite. Sometimes, like, the big, the big people are like, you, you tell you how to pay us, and then sometimes they're like, oh, we don't care because we know our business is going to be fine and, you know, they trust their customers and stuff, and then the smaller people are like, hey, you got to pay me in this exact way. I think the conversation that people typically have with their vendors when they're making this sort of transition is payment is.
T.J. Langerak: Now.
Christian Sheerer: We don't have to store meaning as a customer of our vendor. If I'm TJ, it's like I'm telling them, oh, I don't even have to store your payment information. really, like I have Nickel to externalize that and make it super simple for me to like track when against I'm overdue on a balance or under underperforming on the balance. And so I can like just create new bills also gonna sync to QuickBooks automatically and then pull in for what invoice that is right. however much it's supposed to be.
T.J. Langerak: On.
Christian Sheerer: Whatever due date it is. And then this information will get populated if they're sending invoices that you're routing through QuickBooks Online. So if that is that the process they give you an invoice and then you put it through QuickBooks Online and then you pick which way you're paying them out?
T.J. Langerak: Yep. Okay, cool.
Christian Sheerer: And so yeah, No. And so yeah, you'll have your payment method. This makes it pretty simple so that you store it once. If there's a change, we'll obviously notify you. There'll be like, you know, an alert that's like, hey, we couldn't send it to here. It's going into the ether. But we store it once and then you just minimize the you were not again, not replacing that QuickBooks Online step, but you're just like, okay, that invoice is pulled in from QuickBooks Online for Porta John for Project 36 of the year. And now I'm going to go in and just like pay out against that invoice with the routing and account number that they gave me. And so we're flowing on both sides, AP and AR.
T.J. Langerak: Okay. Yep.
Christian Sheerer: And then also same thing. And then are you guys tracking this stuff in Smartsheet also?
T.J. Langerak: No, just in QuickBooks, right? Yeah. Okay, cool.
Christian Sheerer: So I was going to say the same type of thing where you now have that visibility against bills or visibility against vendors. still exists here, but you're doing that in QuickBooks. It's just now in Nickel, you'll be able to also see like prepayment getting reconciled in QuickBooks automatically. Okay, you know, what's my open balance on each of these? What's my spend for all of these vendors on the year? Which will allow you some just like quick visibility, right? Rather than having to like go in and maneuver the ERP and try to pull all that stuff per each one.
T.J. Langerak: Okay. And that'll, all that payment information will auto populate from QuickBooks, you said, right? Because all that information is going into, all the invoices are going to go into QuickBooks regardless. For our accounting.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, that's what this little green yeah. Thing is, is recognizing.
T.J. Langerak: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: And you could, I know this has only come up in one Archideck conversation that I had. It comes up in, in, in various other customers have, like, one-off invoices that they might need to charge and then post reconcile into QuickBooks. But she was, they have outside of the normal standard. four type invoices that you described, they have like a historical she's in Savannah, so she does like, you know, has to have a check in with the historical landmark sites to make sure that they can build where they need to build and do all that stuff. So she has a fifth step in the middle of like one and two or two and three that sometimes she'll just create like a new invoice for which would just be created in nickel because it's more rare, right? It's just not part of the standard operating procedure of the four steps. So that's an option too. So either way, so yeah, to answer your question is yes, right? It'll populate automatically with the integration. But if you do need an extra level of customization where it's like, oh, this one particular invoice, Hey, we have a separate one. Cool, you can run it through, create it through Nickel, and then it'll get post hoc added into QuickBooks Online.
T.J. Langerak: Okay. Yep. Cool.
Christian Sheerer: Awesome. I guess that's for the most part, pretty much it in terms of like how to maneuver the system. you want to pulse check on just like your familiarity just in taking that cursor review and like confidence in it being a useful solution for y'all.
T.J. Langerak: What's the cost?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, it's only 35 a month for the whole business. So you can have as many users as you'd like. And yeah, it's 35 for the company basically. not for customer, not for vendor. It's 35 for Archadeck of Maine.
T.J. Langerak: Yeah, I think that's about what Ryan told me he was paying. So this is the biggest thing I guess I'm looking at. I'm looking at my P and L for the year. In QuickBooks payments fees, I currently have $1,853. payment fees. So, yeah.
Christian Sheerer: And so if those are on ACH, well, in both instances, that's, those will go away.
T.J. Langerak: Yeah. Right. So, yeah, that's, I guess that's one of the biggest things that interests me is just because you guys are doing it quite a bit more competitively than they are. Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: And I think the, the reason is twofold. One is they focus on ERP, right? That's their business. They're really good at it. You know, QuickBooks Online, we're not going to build an ERP, right? And so they're the best in class and so people link up to them. So that's why we integrate with them. And so their payments are sort of like, oh, if we could get an $1,800 cash grab on people like TJ who don't want to have to like think about it because really you shouldn't have to think about it extending payments, right? Then we'll do it. And so they don't focus on it. And so that's why it's like a lower I guess they'd have to charge for it because their margins are made elsewhere. And so when we focus on payments, that's why we're allowed, it's sort of because we work with a lot of larger businesses moving a lot of money so we can focus on making the ACH free. And then if that 1800 is also made up of, what is it? Some credit card, if you're passing them on, right, then that also goes away.
T.J. Langerak: Too. Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: And, and so that's like the nice part of these conversations. I can always be like, yeah, that's, you know, the uninteresting. It's interesting for the business owner, right? It's like, oh, I get to save this, but that's like the uninteresting.
T.J. Langerak: Cool.
Christian Sheerer: Automatically that goes away. And then it's like, okay, what is also the benefit of all the time that I save now having to not manually go through and like track against customers and Smartsheet, I can see it in nickel, and then I update Smartsheet a lot quicker than I would. And as it, well, I to wait for like checks to come in the mail and we have to drive them to the bank and deposit them in person and all that stuff. And so that's like the added, I flip it. I think the 1800 is sort of like the added cherry on top of what we save, on top of all the time saved. And if you think about like how much is my time worth, right? That's probably even more than the 1800.
T.J. Langerak: Yep. Okay. Cool.
Christian Sheerer: And so the real, like the way that, like I described at the beginning in terms of like getting people able to use, make the most of it, we sort of separated into a couple parts. One is I can send you a full breakdown of what we chatted today in a recap and point out sort of where in the platform you guys benefit the most from and based on how you guys currently do things with Jerica. And then in between and then we typically set up a check in in between now and then you log in, maybe run some transactions. I say tests sometimes because, you know, you want to, you know, remove the mental barrier of like maybe somebody you just send like a $1 transaction just to get the workflow understood. But I also don't like saying tests sometimes because, you know, we can move hundreds of thousand dollars in one transaction. It's not like you need to really test it, right? But whatever you're comfortable with, and then we can check in at that time and troubleshoot any issues that you came up with. And then also if there's any questions about like, okay, I have this AR side figured out, but the AP side, I don't know, we didn't go too deep on it today. Let's go deeper on that side. in that check-in and then over time, we sort of transform that into like a monthly cadence of a check-in that's like, hey, we're here if you need us, if you want to, you know, pick our brains on how your guys' process is moving. And then if not, you're like, hey, you know, everything's working smoothly. Let's, you know, postpone this.
T.J. Langerak: Cool. Yep. Okay.
Christian Sheerer: Awesome.
T.J. Langerak: Sounds good.
Christian Sheerer: Do you have any invoices or transactions you'd think top of mind in the next couple weeks that we can plan around those?
T.J. Langerak: Oh, yeah. Yeah. We'll be sending out final payment on a job very shortly, either possibly this afternoon, maybe tomorrow, probably more likely tomorrow. Okay, cool.
Christian Sheerer: Well, if you think we've earned enough trust to run that through nickel, I would say that might be a good next step for us, is if you want to test that one out and then we can get back together on Friday, I think by then it will have cleared whatever process it is, whether it's ACH. I mean, if it's card, it will for sure. And then we can check in there and see how. And then it'll also give enough time to reconcile that back into QuickBooks. And, we can check in there and see how everything went and then also plan out if we need to any more conversations we need to have with Jerika, the rest of the team, get them familiar and up to speed.
T.J. Langerak: Okay, sounds good. Cool.
Christian Sheerer: Um, awesome. So then I'll, I'll get to work and being a little bit faster and getting my recap. I usually do those at the end of the day, but I'll get it so that you have ammo. You followed it. Everything, everything is pretty clear, but just for my peace of mind of like, okay, cool. I, addressed TJ as TJ and I gave him all the stuff that he needed to do, and then we'll get back together on Friday. Does earlier in the day work for you on Friday?
T.J. Langerak: Let me look at my calendar. I'm pretty open on Friday.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, the most free I am is 11 Eastern.
T.J. Langerak: That works. Cool.
Christian Sheerer: I'll make it TJ this time. I'm still gonna, I'm sorry for keep bringing that up. That's just so funny to me.
T.J. Langerak: Yeah, no worries. No worries. It happens a lot. I bet.
Christian Sheerer: Especially over the phone and stuff, you.
T.J. Langerak: Know what I mean? Yep. Cool.
Christian Sheerer: And you guys are central Maine. Are there other ones in Maine?
T.J. Langerak: Nope. How cool.
Christian Sheerer: Take the Maine name then.
T.J. Langerak: Yeah, they'd like to have one down around Portland. That's the one that's available, but nobody's. Got it right now.
Christian Sheerer: We used to go to Maine. My uncle lives out there. I have like six uncles and my mom has six brothers, which is crazy. But he's in Brunswick.
T.J. Langerak: Oh, yeah.
Christian Sheerer: Is that in your area? Yeah.
T.J. Langerak: Yeah. We build in Brunswick.
Christian Sheerer: Awesome. Awesome.
T.J. Langerak: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: No, I haven't been out there in a while, but we used to love going up in the summer and then diving in the lake when they could go in the lake. And it's like 40 degrees.
T.J. Langerak: It's like, what are we doing? Yeah. Yeah. It's not too bad a place in the summertime, that's for sure.
Christian Sheerer: Neither in the winter, too. It's good in the winter.
T.J. Langerak: You just got to be yeah, built. You'Re gonna dress for it. for it, that's for sure.
Christian Sheerer: A lot of LL Bean catalogs.
T.J. Langerak: Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. We like our LL Bean up here, that's for sure. Yeah. Cool.
Christian Sheerer: Well, awesome. I. Yeah, I'll get that over to you in the next couple of 30 minute time periods and next couple hours and.
T.J. Langerak: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: Let me know how it goes. I'll also send my number. In the case that, what is it? In case you just need to get me quicker than an email, something comes up, you want to call me, that's cool.
T.J. Langerak: All right. Sounds good. Cool.
Christian Sheerer: All right, T.J. It was wonderful to meet you and we'll chat later this week.
T.J. Langerak: All right. Thanks. Cool. See you.
