Tiffany Smith: Are you in the office today?
Christian Sheerer: I. Me? Yeah, I am. I am.
Belle Swartz: Oh, okay.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, yeah, in the office. Removing offices soon, which is nice. So.
Tiffany Smith: Oh, you're moving from Brooklyn?
Christian Sheerer: Well, we're going to stay in Brooklyn. We're moving from. We're in Prospect Heights sort of right now. Like. Yeah. We're on Dean street. And the cross is like. I forget the cross, but a little bit past the Barclays center. And we're gonna move to Dumbo.
Tiffany Smith: Oh, nice. Dumbo is nice.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, I know. I think so, too. But I like it over here because it's like a neighborhood, you know, like there's.
Belle Swartz: Yeah.
Tiffany Smith: I was gonna say, isn't. That's, like, the downtown area?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. And Dumbo is going to be like. Dumbo, right? Like, it's nice.
Tiffany Smith: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: Gonna be like, you know, the only lunch.
Tiffany Smith: There's no. It's more, like, commercial. They have, like, a lot of restaurants and stuff over there.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah.
Tiffany Smith: Bigger office.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. Yeah, exactly. That's what I was gonna say. I'm excited about that. It's going to be more. It's like, going to be to ourselves as well. Like, we're in a. We're in a shared space.
Tiffany Smith: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. And so we'll have like a, you know, a big office, which will be eerie for the time being, but we're gonna start to kind of grow a lot.
Tiffany Smith: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: And so that'll be fun while they hop on you. How's it been going just on. On your end?
Tiffany Smith: Well, I haven't used the system since, you know, because I don't really do billing like that. I manage the billing team, so I wanted to add them to the call because they're using it every day. Compared to me, that'll probably do, like, one or two transactions every once in a while.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, cool, cool, cool. I guess I'm just seeing your name on it because you. Yeah. Yeah. Awesome.
Tiffany Smith: Yeah. So yesterday, I know. They used it for the first time with a credit card.
Christian Sheerer: Cool. Yeah. Yeah. Somebody.
Tiffany Smith: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: Bell is hopping in.
Belle Swartz: Hi.
Christian Sheerer: Hey, Belle.
Belle Swartz: How are you?
Christian Sheerer: Good. How are you? It's nice to meet you.
Belle Swartz: You, too. Thank you.
Tiffany Smith: We're waiting for Carol.
Belle Swartz: Yeah, I had to go in through my personal Google Gmail account, so.
Tiffany Smith: Yeah, it made me do that, too. So it's weird because this time it's Google. Meet Kristen. We did Skype last week.
Christian Sheerer: Did we do Zoom last week? Oh, my God.
Tiffany Smith: Zoom.
Christian Sheerer: Right.
Tiffany Smith: We did zoom. Right, sorry. Zoom last week.
Christian Sheerer: I think when I. When I quickly send the invitations, it, like, defaults to Google for some reason.
Belle Swartz: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: I'm used to. Yeah, I'm used to zoom, and I default to zoom and other places. Yeah. Okay, that's my bad. I'm, I'll, I'll just, I'll just be more mindful when I'm sending out.
Tiffany Smith: Yeah.
Belle Swartz: Hopefully she can get on, because I don't. I think you need a Gmail account to get on.
Tiffany Smith: I think you could bypass it. Let me ask her if she's having.
Christian Sheerer: And, and I can send a zoom link as well pretty quickly. So if, if, if you guys are flexible.
Tiffany Smith: I can send one if that's easier first. Belle, in the meantime, did any of your clients complain about the fee being on the receipt?
Belle Swartz: No, not as of that. No.
Tiffany Smith: I think you did realize it's a little bit lower, right? Did you catch that?
Belle Swartz: Oh, I did not. It said 3% in, in the system, so now I just. Yeah, but it's still like 2.91 or something.
Tiffany Smith: Yeah, it's still doing the 2.9. I caught it with free, but it's, it's like, sense. It's like 20. Like, like the most that I saw was like 20 cents. I was like, I think we'll just leave it and catch it. But I don't think, I think they should be more happy. Yeah, it's a few cents list, but we'll see.
Belle Swartz: Oh, God. Okay.
Tiffany Smith: I think I asked to join. She said she asked to join. Christian, do you see her request?
Christian Sheerer: Yes, yes, yes.
Tiffany Smith: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: Hey, Carol.
Tiffany Smith: We can't hear you. Carol, if you can hear us.
Christian Sheerer: Okay.
Tiffany Smith: Hello?
Carol: Hey, sorry about that.
Christian Sheerer: No, no, no worries. I, I, I must have thrown y' all in for a loop because I sent a Google Meet by accident instead of a zoom. So we're all, we're all good. We're all on schedule. I'm glad we could make the time. So, yeah, Tiffany is filling me in as you guys were hopping on to introduce myself. I'm like an account executive here. I kind of help people get set up with nickel. In the beginning, we have a customer success team that kind of deals with existing business. But as you guys are getting used to it, you know, I can field those questions. And then we can, you know, build like, a nice little document for, for them to take on when on a more kind of, you know, irregular cadence, I guess. Regular, but like a more spread out cadence because you guys have, you know, figured out the system and back and forth they can take over for me. So I, so I transition back into helping people who haven't, you know, used it at all for the first time. But Tiffany was filling me, you guys, this first interactions with it and that she said that you might have either a couple questions or we like to field feedback and all of those things.
Belle Swartz: Okay, who wants to start?
Tiffany Smith: Yeah, let me jump in real quick. So I was telling him that I don't use it as much as you guys do. I only do, like, one off transactions. So I feel like you guys will have a lot more to say than I will because I'm not in there 24 7. So if there's any feedback, anything that didn't work. I know you had an issue yesterday with one of the credit cards. And then he said something happened with you, Carol, that I wasn't aware of. But just like, things like that, like, just to provide feedback so, you know, we can make this as smooth as possible going forward.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. And. And also just to, you know, it's like, pretty foolproof. Like, you guys have clearly figured it out very quickly and, and. And done quite a bit of transactions. And so it's also like, if there are things that in the first instance, when we kind of field, you know, when I was, you know, talking with Tiffany, things that maybe I shared with her that didn't make it all the way down to you, and you have some particular kind of workflow that you guys have on your end that you want me to help think through. That's, like, the most exciting part of my job is, like, to be able to critically think through different scenarios with y'. All. And so that's what this time is for, too.
Belle Swartz: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: Also, totally valid answer. If everything's like, oh, it's cool. And, you know, like, totally valid answer, too. If it's. If you're grasping at straws to find things, that's. That's. We don't need to do that.
Belle Swartz: Sounds good.
Carol: Yeah. I think the biggest issue I just had yesterday, like, I randomly ran into my browser not letting me save any credit cards. I could put everything in. I just couldn't save it. And I could save ach. But then it was quite literally a simple fix of just like, close my browser, open it back up, and everything was working again. The only other, I think, issue I kind of ran into while processing credit cards, I have one client who has a MasterCard. And the number is accurate. Everything about the numbers is correct. But even when we used Intuit, Intuit would let us store. Store it because they viewed it as off. But as long as I didn't store it, I could still charge her card. But here in nickel, it let Us save it. But I'm not able to process due to an error that's coming up saying something about policy. So I even tried deleting it out and trying it again and it still won't let me charge. But I know it's like an existing issue. Her card kind of seems to have. And MasterCards seem to have that sometimes too.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, yeah, that must be on the MasterCard. So I think the, yeah, the browser thing was like a cache situation. Cache not with an sh, but with like a che. Like it's storing some memory of something and you just kind of have to like get out and then come back in and it'll, it'll, it'll reset. So I was following along in the, in the support conversation just so I had a download before we got onto the call today. And so I think that is mostly resolved. And if it happens again, it's like, you know, a Chrome or whatever browser storing information in a goofy way situation. And so then the MasterCard thing, I'll make a note of that and see if we've run into that in the past. But yeah, you know, the credit card companies, like ultimately we got to play by their rules. You know, they kind of run the world. It's crazy. I don't, I don't know if I was, I wasn't around in the world when those exploded. But the, my, my, my older friends who tell me about it, they're like when credit cards came out, people just, you, it felt like money was falling out of the sky. And then now, you know, we're kind of beholden to what they do. So the MasterCard like storing issue. Okay, I got you.
Belle Swartz: Thank you.
Tiffany Smith: Question. Is there a way for her to just run a transaction without storing the card or it has to be stored with the authorization?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, let me see. Actually, yeah, this came up yesterday and somebody else. And there is technically a way. Yeah. And if I have to pull that out and send it in a screenshot, I will. But let me see if I can pull it out quickly.
Tiffany Smith: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: Oh, that's on. So technically they have to. Yeah, there has to be some level of authorization. The way that they can do it without is if you're sending them the link. But I know that's not your guys's typical workflow.
Tiffany Smith: Right?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah.
Tiffany Smith: Maybe that's something that you guys could probably add to like the list of stuff to look into. Because we do have that option with the, with intuit that we're using right now. Like we can go in to the merchant center and Just process a card in the background. Or we can also do it in QuickBooks without saving the card. Right, Carol?
Carol: Yeah, it gives you 10 minute limit before it'll say you can't charge it. You have to like type it back in.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, okay, let me look into that. And then anything.
Belle Swartz: Well, we have the downloading the receipt issue. So after we do a charge, there's an option to download the receipt. A box comes up that says download receipt, which happens, I'd say like 60% of the time. But then the other 40%, it either doesn't show up at all or it flashes for like a split second and then disappears. So then you just have to go into transaction list and click on there and then go down to the three dots and download each receipt that way.
Christian Sheerer: Okay.
Belle Swartz: But it's easier if we can just be done at the time of the charge, which it's happening. You know, like I said, for. I'd say the majority, but there's still a bunch that it's not. Did you hear that before?
Christian Sheerer: No. Oh, Carol, did you. Did you have something on that?
Carol: Yeah, I did definitely run into that too, here and there. And I've only been printing out or downloading the receipts for people who are paying a credit card so they could see the fee. But when that's happened to me, I know there's like a link at the top of that box that takes you to the specific transaction and you could download it from there. But it definitely was happening, I would say like 25% of the time for me.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, so you guys download every receipt?
Belle Swartz: I do. I've been printing them out just right through there because I always send a copy of the receipt to the client. So my client, our clients have gotten a variety of different types of receipts, but this is the newest and greatest. So yeah, that's what I'm using.
Tiffany Smith: Yeah. So basically Belle and Carol, they do the same billing. Bell is more on the long term care insurance side, so her clients are spoiled. And Carol clients are not so spoiled. So Bell likes to send the transaction receipt, Carol sends the QuickBooks receipt. But for since we removed the credit card fee from the invoice, like I told you I was doing last week, where she's going to use the nickel receipt for the credit card clients only, she's still going to continue sending the QuickBooks receipt for the ACH clients because they don't really care. But Bell likes to use a transaction receipt because it has like the transaction number and stuff. And I get it. There's some clients that are very particular. So I get it. But yeah, Bell clients.
Belle Swartz: This is easy to print them that way than the other way. So.
Tiffany Smith: Yeah. So I think she prefers that when she runs the transaction and it. The download like for every single transaction comes up, so she can download it right there. Then to have to go to the transaction history and. And do that. Bell question. Did you see any pattern? Like, is there like a specific payment type that it's happening for or is just like random?
Christian Sheerer: That was my next question. So.
Belle Swartz: Right. I have to look for that. Almost all of my clients are ACHs, so I'd say that that's not the distinguishing factor. But maybe it has to do with their bank or I don't. I'm not sure like which routing number. You know, could be something like that or I'm really not sure what the pattern is.
Christian Sheerer: No, we can look into it. And so all of them. Do you actually. No, we can look into it. I would. Maybe it's silly question, but you didn't take a screenshot of any of them, did you?
Belle Swartz: There's really nothing to take a screenshot of. It's almost. Right.
Christian Sheerer: Because it goes away. Yeah.
Belle Swartz: Yeah. I mean, I could take a screenshot of when it leaves the option of downloading.
Christian Sheerer: No, we can. We. I mean, we can go into. Not even. We can go into a fake environment of ours and that. So we can. I honestly just hadn't heard of it. So that's. That's like just me. I'm. I'm sure when I walk over to the engineering team, they're going to be like, okay, let's look into it and show me. But yeah. For my personal curiosity. So they're almost all ach. So that makes sense that that might not be the distinguishing factor.
Belle Swartz: Right.
Christian Sheerer: And they're all going through the same flow. Right. Like those invoices are getting created. And then you're saying.
Belle Swartz: Right.
Christian Sheerer: And it's just on the nickel receipt.
Belle Swartz: Yeah, it's just when you hit. I hit request payment and then I click off everything I need to. To charge the client.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah.
Belle Swartz: And then. And then it charges it and then it either pops up or doesn't pop up the box.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. And all of them are getting charged at that time. They're not. They're not scheduled to get charged.
Belle Swartz: No, they're all getting charged like in. In real time.
Christian Sheerer: Okay. That was my other brainstorming there. Okay, so I'll take that. Yeah, I'll take that away to see and. Yeah. Because. So your process is just. So I'm clear, is you make that click through like you said, and then you download it right away there so that you can be like, hey, for, you know, client 147, I'm done. I have a receipt and I'm going to store it in whatever files I have locally on my computer so I can send it to them later on.
Belle Swartz: Yeah, either that or I just hit download and then I go back into my whole download list at the end, which is in my downloads, and then I can just rename them and print them out from there. But so it's just basically adding another step because I have to go. Instead of just going straight to my downloads to see the receipts, I have to go back to the transactions process and then go into each client and click on the three dots and download it from there.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, I got you. Okay. Yeah. So I. I want to look into why that's happening for some of them and not. Yeah, for. For to play not devil's advocate, because I don't think this is this. But yeah, I don't want to switch up your guys's process. And it should, if it's possible to them. It should. But I would say, I don't know, just because I'm annoying, I'll be like, hey, maybe just click through all them and then go to transactions after. And you download mass a number of the transactions, move them into downloads, and then. So then you save that extra step. But. Oh, but that would be. That would be.
Tiffany Smith: Is there a way to do that? Yeah, to download the receipts for multiple transactions at the same time.
Belle Swartz: So you don't have to click on the client and then download it. You can. Are you saying that I can go into transactions and download all of the transactions? Let me look.
Tiffany Smith: Yeah, I don't think. I don't see an option there that you can download the receipts for more than one transaction at a time. Like, you literally have to go into each person and download the receipt. Unless we're missing something.
Belle Swartz: You can export it to a CSV. I see that.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. Let me see how that CSV looks. Looks.
Belle Swartz: Let me say. Let me try to go over. No, it doesn't. Let me go over.
Christian Sheerer: If you. Yeah, I mean, yeah, I mean, that was just me brainstorming again, like a prescription of. Of what you should do. I want to. I want to look into that issue regardless. I'm just thinking of like a. Maybe a. Like a quick fix off the top.
Tiffany Smith: Yeah, I mean, if that's possible. That would be great too.
Christian Sheerer: It does show the fees charged, but it's in a CSV format, which is a different format than like the actual receipt, right?
Tiffany Smith: Yeah. She needs a PDF copy of the receipt.
Christian Sheerer: I got you. I got you. Okay. Okay, cool. Yeah. So let me, let me, let me look into that.
Belle Swartz: Okay.
Carol: Did you want to ask about the void thing, though?
Belle Swartz: Yeah. Well, I have one other quick question. One of my clients, now, I did email them to make sure that they don't need to call on their credit card because this is a client whose credit card declines quite often, but it didn't say it declined. It said failed to create customer. Do you know what that means?
Christian Sheerer: Well, that's, that's just because what our verification process is doing on the back end when we have their card, it's basically the same. It's like preventing you from charging a decline.
Belle Swartz: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: A dead card, basically.
Belle Swartz: Okay. Okay. So it's just a regular decline then.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah.
Belle Swartz: Okay, that's fine. Yeah. All right. Well, the other one's. What were we. We were going to ask Carol if we could. Oh, if we void. If. See. Well, we weren't sure how a void showed up in QuickBooks today because we, we didn't. Neither of us thought we voided anything. But if you hit. If you hit refund and it tells you it's going to take a couple days for an ACH, does it do anything in QuickBooks, do you know, at that point?
Christian Sheerer: To my knowledge, it should. It should appear in QuickBooks when those. A couple of days for the ACH clearing to happen elapse.
Belle Swartz: So it wouldn't say void and QuickBooks automatically when you hit refund. Even though. Let me ask you this. If I hit refund and it tells me to wait two days, do I go back in and hit refund again in two days or do I. Will it automatically do it in two days?
Christian Sheerer: No, it'll automatically do it. Basically, what's happening is like it's two day processing time for ach, so it.
Belle Swartz: Is going to refund it then. Yeah.
Carol: And that's why it says voided on her profile.
Belle Swartz: We didn't, we didn't see. Okay, so I have. So it's going to go back into the. The account that it was charged to.
Carol: Then in two days, but it'll still say processing. Like, even though it's like, actually, I guess, like, how do we know that a refund will be a refund? Because in the system it still said processing.
Belle Swartz: Yeah. How do we know when it gets refunded?
Tiffany Smith: Who's a client that you guys are referring to?
Belle Swartz: Well, it was a complicated situation.
Tiffany Smith: Oh, no, Because I'm looking at if it's Charlotte.
Carol: Yeah, it's Charlotte. Schleifer. Schleifer.
Tiffany Smith: Yeah. It was refunded. If you go to refunds, like on the transaction, it's there. Does that help or no?
Carol: Oh, oh, because it wasn't that.
Belle Swartz: That was the 705. That was some last week.
Tiffany Smith: Oh, so it's different. Oh, yeah.
Belle Swartz: This is a different one. We had the wrong account number under the wrong client. So that happened last week. So that's why the 705 is there. But then I thought that I went in and deleted the card, and.
Tiffany Smith: It.
Belle Swartz: Was still in there. So when Carol charged it this week, she charged it automatically went to the wrong client. So I tried to refund it, but it said that it was going to refund in a couple of days. So now I told the client that we would keep it as a credit on the account and use it towards next week's invoice. But if it's going to get refunded, I'm going to have to let them know that we're not doing that and that it's getting refunded.
Tiffany Smith: Yeah, I think it was. Is there a way for you to check Christian on the back end?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, let me look.
Tiffany Smith: I can give you 60. Yeah.
Belle Swartz: Yeah. It would have been charged yesterday, but. So it showed up as void in the. In the wrong client. It's. This is a complicated situation. Hopefully we'll never run into this again, but.
Christian Sheerer: No, you're good.
Tiffany Smith: It's for. I don't know if you can find it, but it's for invoice 57842.
Christian Sheerer: One sec. I'm getting in right now. So I'm going into transactions and for. Sorry, you said client 17482.
Tiffany Smith: No. Oh, I'm giving you the invoice number. Okay. The client is Charlotte. Her first name is Charlotte. Her last name is. How do you say that?
Christian Sheerer: Bell?
Belle Swartz: Like Schleifer. Schleifer. Schleifer. That one's Carol's client.
Tiffany Smith: Okay.
Belle Swartz: Just went in under my client's account number.
Christian Sheerer: Unfortunately, I spelled it right when I took the first.
Tiffany Smith: Oh, that's great.
Christian Sheerer: Let's go. Okay, so I'm seeing 705 and then I'm seeing 1260.
Belle Swartz: Yeah, the 705 is fine. That. That we took care of last time, but I think because it. I think because we voided it on the same day, but I think because this time it's a day later, it wouldn't let us do it.
Tiffany Smith: So you try to avoid the one from the 20. The one that you charge on the 1260.
Belle Swartz: Yeah. Okay.
Christian Sheerer: Okay.
Belle Swartz: So you tried to refund it, but it wouldn't. It said it would take. It said it would take two days. Two business days.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. Can I, can I without scaring you? Because I'm logged into your account. Can I show you that?
Belle Swartz: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, cool. Cool. Probably better that I can get into it than not. Right. But it's this one and you clicked refund payment here.
Belle Swartz: Wait, let me go back.
Carol: Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's where you went, Bel.
Belle Swartz: Yeah. Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: Okay.
Belle Swartz: Then a red box showed up and it looked like nothing really went through. Like it was. I thought it was telling me I have to try again in two days.
Tiffany Smith: But it's voided in QuickBooks. So.
Belle Swartz: Voided in QuickBooks? Yeah.
Tiffany Smith: There's avoided in QuickBooks.
Christian Sheerer: Okay. Yeah. And so this is. And I will get triple confirmation. But to my knowledge of how the like ACH processing works, just writ large, like outside of. Of nickel. Right. Is like. So we send that information to the banking Rails, which, you know, again like, you know, we're tied up to that every other bank is tied up to. That's the Federal Reserve. Right. Is I think the reason that the delay caused it to be a little bit ambiguous of what's happening is because when you send that out, then it's like it's the money, it's all electronic, so it's weird. But it's like technically moving in the system. Right. And then it's going to get processed and then after that it's going to come back. And that's why it's saying that there's two days. That's when the refund will happen. It's because it's already been sent out to be cleared. And I think that's the reason that, you know, the one you caught a little bit earlier didn't. Is because it hadn't been sent out yet. It hadn't been processed at the end of the day of our day. Right. And so I think it's that little hitch that is. Is causing that. And so I will triple check this. But yes, I think it will be like credited.
Belle Swartz: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah.
Belle Swartz: So I, So I should let the client know that they're probably going to see a refund in their checking account.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. And I, I mean just so as to not alarm them or, you know, cause any issues. Let me triple check with my QuickBooks, with my engineers who manage the QuickBooks, just so I, you. I have a confident kind of like, you know, sentence Written out in writing that you can use to communicate.
Belle Swartz: Okay, thank you. Great.
Christian Sheerer: Okay. And just so I'm clear on what initially it was just a. I guess what was initially the reason why you needed to refund it.
Belle Swartz: It went to the wrong account. So when I was entering in all my account numbers.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah.
Belle Swartz: Until I actually hit. Hit save. I. Until I actually charged the card, I didn't realize it was under the wrong client because the name didn't pop up until the very end. And then I was like, why is it showing that name? And then I realized that I entered it all because it was the one below. And I guess it, like, kind of the line moved up and I accidentally clicked on.
Christian Sheerer: I got you that one.
Belle Swartz: So I realized I had done the whole transaction, including any. Including entering the wrong. The bank information from the other client, all under this slaver lady. So then we had to reverse that. And that's what happened last week. But then I was pretty. Well, I thought I deleted the account from her name, but then it was still in there this week. So when Carol charged her, I guess, you know, we just assumed it was the correct account number. And then it went under. It went to the wrong client.
Christian Sheerer: Okay. Okay.
Belle Swartz: So then we. I tried to refund it right away, but was too late. So I told that client that they would have a credit on their account. And Carol charged to the correct account number for the correct client after that.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, I got you. Alrighty.
Belle Swartz: Yeah. So the question is basically just will the refund go the client, who it was charged to, where there's no record of the name matching that account under Schleifer, but it's really. It was really Nord.
Christian Sheerer: Oh, so that. Yeah. Will the 1260 go to Nord?
Tiffany Smith: Yeah.
Belle Swartz: Yeah. And it was the original account number that it was charged under.
Christian Sheerer: Okay.
Belle Swartz: I think it was. Was it 1 9? I think it might have been 19 or something.
Christian Sheerer: Like the last two digits or something.
Belle Swartz: Yeah. I have to look and see what their account number is.
Christian Sheerer: I can check it as well.
Belle Swartz: Okay, let me see.
Christian Sheerer: Nord, I'm seeing Schleifer has. Ends in 95 north. Yeah, Nord is 1 9, 1 9.
Belle Swartz: Rita, Nord and Nord did have a correct charge as well yesterday for 684. But that one is fine. That one needs to be.
Christian Sheerer: I see that.
Belle Swartz: Left alone that one. That one's correct.
Christian Sheerer: Okay. 1 9. And then Schleifer, 9 5. Okay, cool.
Tiffany Smith: Carol, did you charge the correct. Or is still open?
Carol: No, it's still like that. I want to just make sure everything was above board before I did anything.
Tiffany Smith: Okay. Yeah, because. And that's another question too, Kristen. Now. So it's showing that. That it's voided in QuickBooks, but it's not showing up in Nicholas Void. Like, it's. The invoice is not showing back as open. So how will she process that? The correct payment? I guess you have to wait until the other one comes back because it's showing an open balance in QuickBooks, but it's not showing open invoice in nickel.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, I mean, I, I would wait, but if there's a way that we can expedite it because we can also. Like, that's what I want to speak to our Quick. The. The one of the engineers who set up the QuickBooks integration. I just want to confirm that both for that for us as a team and also for Bell, Carol, who's going to communicate to both of those clients.
Tiffany Smith: Right?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah.
Tiffany Smith: Okay. All right. Yeah. So just keep us posted on that. Anything else? Well, and Carol.
Belle Swartz: Is there a way to do a refund? A chart? Like, let's. So we refund. I don't know if you guys know the answer to this or not yet, but we refund security deposits when the client is no longer our client. So we hold a security deposit and then we refund it. And we usually deposit into their checking account or credit, their charge card. Is there a way we could be doing that through nickel?
Christian Sheerer: It set them up as, I mean, we call anything that you are paying outwards to a vendor. So the language there would just be like, you know, the way they would see it is like, hey, Alliance Home Care wants to send you a bill.
Belle Swartz: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: And then in our language, internal. In your nickel account, it'd be called vendor. That's like accounting.
Belle Swartz: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: Would that fall under your guys's like, accounts payable? I'm sure.
Belle Swartz: Receivable? I think it would.
Christian Sheerer: It would be like refunds on receivable.
Tiffany Smith: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: Okay.
Belle Swartz: Accounts receivable. Yeah.
Tiffany Smith: Because that's how we enter credits to show up on nickel or no. Like if they create a credit memo that needs to be refunded or no.
Christian Sheerer: So basically like a refund without a transaction, essentially.
Tiffany Smith: I mean, it's attached to a transaction. So basically the way we do it in QuickBooks is so we, we try, we take an invoice for the security deposit, we charge it, and then when the client is no longer with us, we refund that. Like we created. We create the credit memo from that invoice. So there's a credit on the account.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah.
Tiffany Smith: Have you guys tried it or no.
Christian Sheerer: Credit memo, you, you are, you are tapping into a really big project for us, which we're. I've been on ongoing for a while because we deal with a lot of industrial businesses, right. Like people who, you know, will say, hey, here's a bunch of materials to go. Build a building, pay us. Right. And so like trade credit is the tag of it. That's like a big thing that, that we want to tackle. And so the short of it is like, there's going to be, you know, a situation in which we do that on even these smaller types of transactions. The way that I would work around that today would just be sort of sending them out of bill to a vendor, but on an ad hoc basis. I'm sure there's a way that we can attach credits to those transactions that's just as it currently stands, an atypical type of use case for us. So I would say the easiest way to get money to people is via a bill that you're sending out to them. You're paying a vendor. I know it's your customer in this case, but there might be a kind of, you know, a, you know, ad hoc changing of the transaction for an actual customer using the same customer language. So it doesn't like mess up in QuickBooks. Credit attached to it I'll have to get. Basically that's another thing I'm going to have to take away. I think my, my role here today has been like a fielding of all the good questions that I can like type up in writing for you guys.
Belle Swartz: Yeah.
Tiffany Smith: Because that will be very helpful.
Belle Swartz: Now.
Carol: That we're kind of talking about credits and whatnot. So, like, I have one customer who I did a prepayment for. So sometimes if we know they're not going to be around long, we don't do a security deposit. We just try to use the schedule and make an invoice for the amount of what we think they'll spend. Then when the actual invoice is imported into QuickBooks, we delete the prepayment invoice and then apply it. And so what I've noticed is if there's any payment that hasn't been requested through nickel for an invoice, even if it's been applied later in QuickBooks, it's not reflecting in nickel. So the customer specifically, I think in this case is gunned where they took a $6,000 prepayment and I was able to charge 6,000 yesterday and then charge the remaining balance. But you still see that like $6,000 is like open. So, like, I've noticed.
Tiffany Smith: Okay. Yeah, I think that's a QuickBooks thing. Let me. I'll play with it some more.
Belle Swartz: Okay.
Carol: Or it might just be taking a while to reflect, but that was just like a thing I noticed. But that was it.
Christian Sheerer: And that was yesterday.
Carol: Yeah, it happened yesterday, so I think it might have cleared up by today. But like, I just noticed sometimes you have to make sure if there was a credit or something that you're applying to the invoice to make sure you're taking the amount that's left over based on QuickBooks and type it into Nicole so that you don't over bill the person's invoice.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, I got you. Okay. Yeah, I think that might be another timing of clearing situation.
Belle Swartz: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: Cool. All right. Well, I mean, seems like these few. These things are like few and far between and so that's. That's good to hear. And there's like these really like extraneous scenarios where we have to tighten up, whether it just be like helping communicate where the clearing situations happen and how that Syncs over to QuickBooks because it's real time, but also ultimately. Right. Like passing through ACH happens over the course of one or two days. Right. And. And so it'll sync in real time once it's passed through the ACH Rails. But you know, you know, as we get faster and the world develops, maybe those things will become real time payments as well. And so to summarize, I will look into three main things and then a fourth one on the prepayment on the credit side. So the first being receipt downloading happening right away and not having to force you to go back into the transaction history. And that's not happening because it's ACH or card, because it's pretty much battle. Like you said, all the ACHs in Carol, you said or not, they have all been ach. It's about 30, 40% of them. And Carol, you mentioned it about like 25%. The credit card decline and the failure to create a customer connected to sort of like the MasterCard storing issue and the refund timing with the void that shows up in QuickBooks and with the specific example of Nord and Schleifer as well as that credit prepayment situation.
Belle Swartz: I do have one other question for you. So the issue I had when I charged that client, the name didn't pop up until the very end, like after I had completed the transaction. Like while you're processing, I think there's an invoice number there, but that you don't see the name of the client. Is that. Could that be added in there in that section at all? Or no.
Christian Sheerer: Say that one more time for me.
Belle Swartz: So let me, let me go through this and kind of pretend I'm doing it and then I'll explain it to you. So get paid. I'm not really going to go through with it, but I'm just going to pick one and kind of go through the motions here. Okay. All right, we'll try this one. Invoices. Sorry. All right, let's just. So I'm going to hit. So for David Howell, for example, he doesn't owe that money because that comes from the insurance. But that doesn't matter. So I'm going to hit request payment, and then I'm going to hit. And so now I don't see a name. Oh, yeah, I do see a name there. Okay. Then I'm going to hit charge payment method on file. Charge on the 25th. Okay. So this step that I'm on now.
Christian Sheerer: You mind sharing your screen?
Belle Swartz: I'm not. I'm on my phone, but.
Christian Sheerer: Oh, oh, okay. No worries.
Belle Swartz: I can take a picture of it.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, yeah, that'd be good. I can follow along with you. So you went to customers, and then you went to a customer and you hit charge payment method on file.
Belle Swartz: Yeah, and then I hit the date charge on today. Okay. And then I'm about to hit charge customer.
Christian Sheerer: Okay.
Belle Swartz: But it doesn't have the customer's name there. So it just kind of make me feel better to double check that I'm charging the right customer. But it has the invoice number, I think the 57948. I don't know if there's. I get, you know, I could actually. You can click on. I can click on edit invoice and it shows me the name, actually.
Christian Sheerer: Okay.
Belle Swartz: So that's fine. I can just do that. That's fine.
Christian Sheerer: Okay.
Belle Swartz: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: But I mean, I, I'm. Let me give you a little bit of inside baseball. So I'm gonna take that down too as like a, A well heard and like received suggestion. And they're gonna be like, that's really cool. And if it could take a couple of minutes to fix, they'll fix it if it takes longer. And you know, Belle's like, oh, I can actually see it. It's cool. It'll go on this. But like, you know.
Belle Swartz: Yeah, it's on the radar.
Tiffany Smith: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: So that's. But this is why we have these conversations like this too, is like to figure out those extraneous situations and then learn from the people who use us. And. And. And, like, take a lot of value out of nickel, how to kind of tweak and make it better over and over again.
Belle Swartz: Yeah, I know you guys added the name to the receipt, which was huge. So thank you for doing that.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. I mean, this is. This is what. This is what we want our customers to be like, you know, design partners. And we won't be shy about being like, hey, let's try to figure out a way that we can figure it out if it. You know, if we can. And we also won't shy about. Don't be shy about being like, oh, yeah, that's a really good suggestion. Like, let's make that switch pretty quickly.
Belle Swartz: Yeah, that worked out really well, actually.
Christian Sheerer: Cool.
Belle Swartz: Okay. I'm good.
Tiffany Smith: Yeah, I think that's it. The only thing. Just keep us posted on the. That Charlotte Leisler situation.
Christian Sheerer: And then.
Tiffany Smith: I did had, like, a billing issue that I spoke. I think I spoke to someone yesterday. Who did I switch to? Yeah. So I think he's. He's working on that for me, so I won't bring that up. But.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, no, no, no, that's. And I'll be tracking that as well. Everybody's important to me, but you guys are as well. Um, and so I'll be tracking all that stuff. So I'll corral all of the stuff that we just chatted about today, put that in writing for you. And I have a couple of meetings I gotta get to right now, but I have some free time between, like, 1 and 2. So I'll corral all that stuff so that, you know, you're not on the hook waiting for. How do I communicate to either Nord or Charlotte or, you know, people that we talked about? And. And so you have some. Go ahead there. And then I would suggest maybe we get together another time after the end of the month, once you kind of, like, this month is wrapped up, and then we can plan out, you know, and I can introduce you to the customer success team, who will sort of take the role that I've taken on today of being kind of like the dedicated contact for these types of feedback sessions and any new things, like trade credit, for example, that we start to roll out and being able to help kind of field those questions and also communicate to y' all what's. What's new and improved about nickel.
Belle Swartz: Okay, sounds great. Thank you.
Carol: Thank you so much.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, no problem. Yeah. And thank you all for you know, being so detailed and coming so prepared. So I really do appreciate that. Like, actually. And. And does that. Should we set that up, Tiffany, for like a week from now or a week and a half from now?
Tiffany Smith: I know. Belle, you're out next week, right? Let me see.
Belle Swartz: I'm only out on Thursday. Okay.
Christian Sheerer: Friday might be good.
Tiffany Smith: And Terrell, you're out all week next week. Okay. Next week is not going to be good. Yeah. So next week is not going to be a good week. So could we do the following week?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, yeah. I'll be in. I'll be calling you guys from Mexico, so that'll be fun.
Tiffany Smith: Oh, right.
Belle Swartz: We can wait till.
Christian Sheerer: The work trip. It's a work trip, so. Yeah.
Belle Swartz: Nice.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, no, it's gonna be fun, but I'm just thinking about the. I don't even know what. What time zone it is. I'll be on Mexico.
Belle Swartz: I think it's Cancun or.
Carol: Are you in Cabo?
Christian Sheerer: We're going in. We're going to Mexico City. So two hours behind, so. Okay, that's cool.
Belle Swartz: Oh, okay.
Christian Sheerer: You guys want to do, like, Wednesday? I know we typically do one.
Tiffany Smith: No, Thursday. We could do like, since you're gonna be two hours, we could do like 1:00pm or 1:30pm what's the day? The. The ninth. Is it a ninth? Yeah. October 9th.
Belle Swartz: Okay. Yeah, I'm good. That time.
Christian Sheerer: 1:30 Eastern?
Tiffany Smith: Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: All right, let's do 1:30 Eastern. I'll send you a zoom and. And then I will get all this stuff answered for you and send it over in writing.
Tiffany Smith: All right. Thank you so much.
Belle Swartz: Great. Thank you so much. Thanks for your time.
Carol: Thank you.
Christian Sheerer: No problem. Thank you all. Yeah. Glad we made the time.
Belle Swartz: Okay. All right. Bye.
Christian Sheerer: Bye. It.
