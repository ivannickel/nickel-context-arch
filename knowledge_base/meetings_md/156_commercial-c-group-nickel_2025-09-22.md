Jacob Greenberg: Hey, can you guys hear me?
Andres f Cifuentes Arcila: Yeah, I can hear you.
Jacob Greenberg: Hey, is this Michael?
Andres f Cifuentes Arcila: Yep.
Jacob Greenberg: Hey, Michael. How's it going?
Andres f Cifuentes Arcila: It's going good, man. How about you?
Jacob Greenberg: All well over here. I'm happy we can make some time to connect today. I have half an hour on the calendar. Does that still work for you?
Andres f Cifuentes Arcila: Yep, that's fine.
Jacob Greenberg: All right, cool. So, yeah, the purpose of our call is just to align. I know that you guys create an account on nickel at the end of August, so I just wanted to touch base on kind of what brought you guys to nickel, what you're looking to accomplish, and since I can't help you guys get set up and move forward.
Andres f Cifuentes Arcila: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: So I think for an agenda, if you give me a little bit of background about your company, how you're currently operating, and how you found nickel, then I could show you a little bit of demo, and the outcome of this call could be getting you guys set up and making sure that you're built for processing and have a good timeline in place so that we can better support you guys. Does that sound fair?
Andres f Cifuentes Arcila: Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: Cool. Yeah, go ahead and give me some background on the company. Can you guys hear me still?
Andres f Cifuentes Arcila: Yeah, I can hear you.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, cool. Yeah, go ahead and give me some background on the company.
Andres f Cifuentes Arcila: So we're a contractor, basically. We do renovations, demolition, you know, everything that has to do with construction, flooring, roofing, and things of that nature. I've been doing that for a year now. And we basically want to find a way to pay our vendors and pay our other contractors that's, you know, fast and secure and. Yeah, that's basically. We're currently taking payments with our bank itself, like with our traffic. True. The online banking and all that, but it's taking a while, so we'll just. We're just trying to find a way to. To, you know, have that process a little bit more smooth.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, cool. And then what is. What are the typical transactions you guys are doing and how frequently are you doing? Size wise.
Andres f Cifuentes Arcila: Between 5,000 and up to 20,000.
Jacob Greenberg: And that's on a daily basis. Weekly basis. How many you guys are getting.
Andres f Cifuentes Arcila: A month would be between 10,000 and I would say 30.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, so like one or three transactions a month?
Andres f Cifuentes Arcila: No, it would be a couple, depending on the amount of projects. But let's say like maximum, like, five transactions and. Yeah, up to 30,000.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, cool. And then right now you guys are just doing bank transfers for ach. Correct.
Andres f Cifuentes Arcila: Right.
Jacob Greenberg: And how did you find out about nickel online? Just Google?
Andres f Cifuentes Arcila: Yep.
Jacob Greenberg: All right, sweet. So it looks like you guys already created your account and you link your bank. Do you guys use any accounting systems like QuickBooks? We do you guys use QuickBooks? You use online or desktop?
Andres f Cifuentes Arcila: I think it's desktop.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. Okay, cool. If you're using QuickBooks Enterprise, we don't have a two way sync built out yet, but our customers that do have QuickBooks Desktop will do a CSV download just to update their books whenever it's time to update the books. If you do have QuickBooks online, which I know that QuickBooks is pushing everybody to go online by the end of this year, we'll be able to do an automatic two way sync between your books. So whenever you create an Invoice from within QuickBooks or receive a payment from nickel, it'll automatically populate on both Nickel and QuickBooks.
Andres f Cifuentes Arcila: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: Do you have a timeline for beginning this project?
Andres f Cifuentes Arcila: What was that again?
Jacob Greenberg: Do you have a timeline for when you want to begin processing on nickel?
Andres f Cifuentes Arcila: I mean, not really. I would say asap, because we're already, you know, taking payments.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. Okay, cool. So if you can, can you. Do you have the ability to share your screen with me? There is a share button on the bottom of the zoom meeting. And if you go ahead and share your screen and go to getnickel.com and log in, I could walk you through what you're going to step. That's going to be.
Andres f Cifuentes Arcila: I'm on my phone though.
Jacob Greenberg: Oh, okay, no problem. Let me pull up a demo environment for you. Okay. All right. So can you see my screen here?
Andres f Cifuentes Arcila: Yep.
Jacob Greenberg: So once you guys log in and start doing some transactions, this is what your transaction page would look like. So it's going to be pretty easy to manage all of your sending and receiving of money for what you're trying to do. You're going to be living mostly out of the get paid section here on the left hand side. So you just go ahead and create an invoice here and you can choose a customer to send it to. And you'd enter the invoice information, the amount and any notes for the customer. So I'm going to create a test one for you guys. And what's the name of your company? One more time. Excuse me.
Andres f Cifuentes Arcila: Commercial.
Jacob Greenberg: How do you spell that?
Andres f Cifuentes Arcila: Just commercial. Co letter C.
Jacob Greenberg: I'll put my email in here so I can show you what it looks like to receive a transaction. You put the invoice amount and the purpose number. So if you use, if you do sync quickbooks, this will automatically populate with the invoice number there. Put the amount here you can pick whether it's one time or recurring invoice, the date that you create the invoice and the due date of the invoice. If you want it to be paid immediately, just put the same day you put any notes for the customers and you can upload any documents. So you'll be able to upload, you know, PDFs line item invoices. If you do sync with QuickBooks, all of your invoice PDFs will automatically sync over to the invoice here in N. But you can also upload photos of the job site, Net terms, agreements, whatever you want and live directly here within invoice. And then you just go ahead and click create and then you send that payment link and it will look like, it'll look like this. So this will be commercial group. Your company name, invoice number, your logo will be right here. Your company name will be right here. I'll say you have a payment request. I'll say your name requested as payment. You'll have the amount and any notes for the customer. Go ahead and click Pay now and this is what that portal will look like. So your customer has the ability to see any PDFs that you attach to the invoice for your transaction. They'll be able to select pay by bank to pay via ACH with no fee, similar to how you're doing it now. And they'll also have the ability to pay by card if they want to. And the processing rate for credit cards will automatically be applied so that your customer can have the option to pay for free or to get the cash flow advantage of paying by card with the additional fee already built into it.
Andres f Cifuentes Arcila: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: Once they pay, that invoice will move into the completed section here and you'll be able to see historic transactions that have been fully paid. So you'll see that the amount is here and that the paid amount is here. Now, if someone hasn't fully paid yet or, or if it's overdue, you go ahead and click send a reminder or request payment and it will send the payment reminder. Very straightforward and easy. You guys have already set up your bank account. You just need to start to process your transactions by going and creating your first invoice, adding that customer and sending additionally. Do you guys have a website right now?
Andres f Cifuentes Arcila: We do.
Jacob Greenberg: What is the website?
Andres f Cifuentes Arcila: It's commercial letter C group dot net. It's still, you know, being built, so. But yeah, that's cool.
Jacob Greenberg: So from here we have some customers that will put a payment portal as a link on their website. So there will just be a button that says pay now and your customers can come in here. This will have your name and your logo and whatever other photo you want to have. You'll be able to just make a payment directly. And this will be automatic free ach or the credit card up to them. So, for example, this is what the checkout page would be. And they can open this on their phone or on their laptop. This makes it easy as well. So that feature comes for free. Can you access it by going to your homepage here, clicking this payment portal link, and then your link will be here. It'll say commercialcbroup.nickelpayments.com you can copy and paste that into a button on your website. For now, though, you've already linked your bank account. And all you need to do to get going is to create an invoice by going here and clicking Create new invoice and then you can start to process payments. Okay, go for it.
Andres f Cifuentes Arcila: Yeah, I was just gonna ask if you guys needed, like, you know, the EIN number, you know, the old business paperwork just. Or how does that work? Should I send that to you?
Jacob Greenberg: When you. When you create the account, you're requested to input the EIN number to begin with. So that should already be there. Additional documents are occasionally required for processing your transactions. So if you. I can't see access to your nickel page, but you'll be able to see that once you go in. So when you go in and log in and nickel to create your first invoice, you might see that you've completed onboarding and you're done and ready to go. I'm not sure because I don't have access to it, but you might have to finish onboarding. And onboarding is just going through a couple like, exactly like what you said, just uploading some basic business information, but it should only take a couple seconds.
Andres f Cifuentes Arcila: Okay. All right, awesome.
Jacob Greenberg: And you said you're looking to do this asap. Are you planning on doing some transactions this week?
Andres f Cifuentes Arcila: Probably the first two weeks of October, which we're finishing some projects and I might send the invoice this week, but it's going to be due for before the 15th of October.
Jacob Greenberg: Most likely it'll be due before the 15th. Okay, gotcha.
Andres f Cifuentes Arcila: Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: So what I'm going to do then is I'm just going to set a reminder meeting for us. Michael Robinson 0927@gmail. Correct?
Andres f Cifuentes Arcila: Yep.
Jacob Greenberg: I'll send an invite for us to reconnect on the second full week of October. So on the 9th and this way if you have done some transactions, we can check in and make sure everything's going smoothly. If not, and you're still about to send your first transaction, I can support you in any way you need.
Andres f Cifuentes Arcila: Okay. All right, sounds good to me. And if one of, of the, of the, of the transactions, what's the, you know, the normal payout time, turnaround time and all that?
Jacob Greenberg: Yep. So if you're on the three, I'll show you a moment off screen here. So if you're on our free solution, Nickel, four times are three day turnarounds and credit card is two day. If you upgrade to Nickel plus, it's a two day credit, two day turnaround for ACH and next day turnaround for credit card.
Andres f Cifuentes Arcila: Okay, and what, what's the, that's the only difference between those two.
Jacob Greenberg: The other difference is that there is a limit of $25,000 per transaction on Nickel Core and there's no limit on Nickel plus. You can also have a couple other features like you can schedule payments in advance. If you wanted to do recurring payments, you would be using Nickel Plus. We also offer customer success managers as an onboarding assistant. You do sign up for plus.
Andres f Cifuentes Arcila: Okay. All right, that's, I mean 35 bucks is not too bad, honestly.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah. Is that something you'd want to do? Just have the faster turnaround time?
Andres f Cifuentes Arcila: Yeah, but yeah, I'll, maybe I'll do the trial and see, you know, how everything comes out and then yeah, I might be continuing, you know, paying that amount.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah. If you wanted to. We do have a 14 day pre trial, so you can go ahead and sign up and you can always upgrade whenever you want to.
Andres f Cifuentes Arcila: Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: By going into your settings here.
Andres f Cifuentes Arcila: Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: Working on plans and then you can decide which plan you would like to use. So you can upgrade on your own.
Andres f Cifuentes Arcila: What was that again?
Jacob Greenberg: You can upgrade on your own at any time. If you would like to, you just go into settings and then click on the plans button here.
Andres f Cifuentes Arcila: All right.
Jacob Greenberg: All right, cool. So I'm going to send out that invite right now. One second here. And I just sent it out for Thursday the night.
Andres f Cifuentes Arcila: Okay. Yeah, just got it.
Jacob Greenberg: All right, sounds good.
Andres f Cifuentes Arcila: All right, thank you, Jacob.
Jacob Greenberg: You got it. I'll talk to you soon.
Andres f Cifuentes Arcila: Thanks, man.
