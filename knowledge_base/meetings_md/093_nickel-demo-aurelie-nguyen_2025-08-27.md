Christian Sheerer: Hello?
ANguyen: Hello, able to join?
Christian Sheerer: I can hear you now.
ANguyen: Yes, all right. Yeah, I needed to call my phone because My computer audio is not great.
Christian Sheerer: No worries. Glad to connect. And so, I saw that you had sent some questions into support. What were the nature of those? I'm here to help as an accounting executive. I kind of help companies like yours get set up, whether they be as accounting firms or direct individual companies. I know you were thinking about the QuickBooks integration, so let me know, I guess, where you'd like to start and what would be most useful for you.
ANguyen: So first, just to give you some context, well, I work in a tax firm and I am the account manager of multiple clients that need some accounting. One of my client is looking into He is now just processing payments through Chase where he's receiving, he's just processing invoices there so he can receive the payments from his clients. We wanted to move everything to QuickBooks, but doing that would just realize there's just the fees are just too high. So I've been making some research on behalf of my client. So I don't know if this is something that we can set up, you know, with multiple users because I will be the person doing it, but it's not for my business. It's for a client. So that would be my first question. And then from there, I guess it's more a question of how it works. I do know pretty good how QuickBooks works, but I don't know. We have all of the ACH of his clients with, you know, assigned paper from all of his clients for their ACH. So I don't know, do we need to send another request to them or can we just enter that manually? Because we're trying to not send too many emails to them and then wait for them for other answers when we already have that and have that for months. So that's my other question.
Christian Sheerer: Awesome. Yeah, we can do both of those pretty easily. We can link up to QuickBooks if you guys are using it as the ERP, as the accounting software. and create invoices back and forth in between Nickel and there. You can also make those payments specific, send out specific invoices, or collect an authorization form from them so that you can pull them directly, automatically with their consent. And yeah, we deal with accountants all the time who are managing other businesses, and they have one accountant portal where they log in, and then their clients are also able to log in and you can manage it concurrently where you're both setting up approvals for either one of you to manage that individual clients where you have this one big account as K&R or yourself with the individual clients underneath it. What are the types of businesses that you're dealing with as your clients and what are their payment volumes look like?
ANguyen: All varies from a lot, and they're doing all kinds of different things. So that's what I'm calling for, for that specific client that wants to change his payment method. But he's a business coach. That's what he does. So he has people that pay him monthly fees, always usually the same amount for coaching every month. So that would be what I'm looking for. But like I say, it's usually around each of his client will pay around 5k a month and then it's becoming an issue with the situation he has right now with Chase because he has a limit every day that he can do. So he has to scatter it throughout the month, which is not ideal.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, what is the monthly volume?
ANguyen: I mean, it's not always the same. I would say maybe between 300 to 400K that he will need to process on a monthly basis.
Christian Sheerer: Awesome. Okay, 300 to 400. Okay. And then for those other, for those other clients?
ANguyen: Oh, I mean, I don't know. I don't do all the clients either. Um, I mean, I have dentists, I have CRNA, so they just are paid. They don't have to collect money. Um, I have all kind of different professionals. So.
Christian Sheerer: Cool, awesome. And so the main thing that you're looking for is just to be able to run those ACHs, give customers of his the option to pay maybe in a variety of different ways in credit card as well, and then have one place that you can help him assist in connecting that to an accounting software, track those transactions, make approvals, etc.
ANguyen: Yes, yes.
Christian Sheerer: Cool.
ANguyen: Yes.
Christian Sheerer: Awesome. And so let me show you here what that sort of looks like. And so when you come in and go into a particular person's client, profile, this is what it'll look like. So you can come in and get paid and go to a particular customer. So if he has that usual customer, he can actually send out a link to send them authorization so that he can just pull it, you know, from their accounts when they put their, their information on file, their payment method, and so that he doesn't have to go back and forth and notify them on payments that are due. If they give this consent, which they'll work through these questions, which we sort of break down for them how Nickel works and where they're storing their information so that, you know, he doesn't even have to store their information himself. We will keep it in between himself and you guys and his customers. They'll review the terms and then get authorized. And you can set up transaction limits, you can make it unlimited, you can set up a particular expiration date for this level of authorization, and then they'll agree to it and you can just pull when they've made that authorization, that fund for those invoices.
ANguyen: Okay, so for the initial payment on Nickel, the client still needs to put that information first.
Christian Sheerer: Well, yeah, they need to be able to authorize that they're, you know, that they're willing to give their money to you.
ANguyen: Yeah, I cannot use the forms I already have and sign from client. we'll have to do, like I say, for everyone the first time.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, I think that's probably the best because now we're in the loop, right? Whereas their previous authorization wasn't recognized by Nipal, right?
ANguyen: Okay, that makes sense.
Christian Sheerer: And then for those invoices where there's a new one coming, I will send them whatever the amount is. On a due date, you can upload a contract that you guys have, whatever type of document, and I can send this link to myself or to my customer, and then I'll go in and this is what the customer will see. and they get to pick which way that they'll pay. And so you can push those card fees onto them, or they can just choose that ACH, which will be no fees.
ANguyen: So is there a way once they have put their banking information that it's just recurring and they don't have to go and manually do, okay, I'm gonna pay this way.
Christian Sheerer: Yep. And that's, yeah, that's the first way I showed you where I'll set up a recurring invoice for Kenneth, for example, and then I'll see all the ones for that recurring that have already been made. Or I can make a new one and I'll say, okay, for Chris, I will do retainer or whatever you guys call it. 1000, you said 5000 every month. whatever date you can set an end date. I'll create it and then I'll once I have that authorization form, I'll charge the payment method on file.
ANguyen: Okay, sounds good. What about so my so you have to create an invoice here. Is there is there a way for me to create invoice on QuickBooks or would those invoice will be linked?
Christian Sheerer: If they're created on QuickBooks, QuickBooks online? Yes. If they're created on QuickBooks, they'll automatically be created on Nickel and vice versa. If you create one on Nickel and you have it linked to QuickBooks, it'll be created in QuickBooks. Once it gets paid out, I'll see these ones get paid. That status will update in
ANguyen: QuickBooks
Christian Sheerer: as well. Okay. So it's back and forth. So.
ANguyen: I'm just thinking, so I create my invoice directly on QuickBooks. Let's say I have a recurring invoice that goes out every month. Will it know on Nickel that to take that payment from the payments on file?
Christian Sheerer: If they have that authorization, yep.
ANguyen: Okay. I don't have to go back in there and then change the modify the invoice there. Okay.
Christian Sheerer: No, you shouldn't have to.
ANguyen: And is it connected as an app in QuickBooks?
Christian Sheerer: It's connected via API. if that's okay. Yeah, you have a you'll go into your account settings and set up an integration to link your QuickBooks account and you'll log into that specific QuickBooks account.
ANguyen: Okay. As far as fees, I know you have this like different tiers and then they each have I guess different limits. I don't have it here in front of me. but I think the one in the middle was the one probably we would be fine with.
Christian Sheerer: Yep. So would you say just 35 a month?
ANguyen: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: What. What was your question?
ANguyen: No, I'm just. I'm just looking at. Okay. And there's no limit on the amount we can pull. No, there.
Christian Sheerer: No.
ANguyen: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: Up to a million. Do you ever pull transactions above a million?
ANguyen: Per transaction or per month?
Christian Sheerer: Per transaction.
ANguyen: No. I mean, it would be great, but no.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, yeah. So that is where we have to enter into a conversation about it.
ANguyen: Okay. And I'm just trying to figure out if I have it. So what would be the best way for me to help my client doing that, does he needs to create his own login and then he invites me as an accountant?
Christian Sheerer: I think the opposite. So you'll set up an accountant account and then you can invite him as a sub-account or use his information that you might have on file to create that sub-account for him. When you go through the flow on getnickel.com, it'll ask you if you're an individual business or an accountant. and so hit accountant. And so that will allow you to also bring on new clients onto the platform should they have a similar need.
ANguyen: So that that 35 per month will be charged to me and I can have as many clients as I want under that same.
Christian Sheerer: Correct.
ANguyen: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: Okay.
ANguyen: So because. this client I'm talking about has two separate QuickBooks accounts with two different business and he does the same thing for both. So I could have both within the same and it's not going to be more.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, exactly. Yeah, they're going to be separate sub accounts.
ANguyen: Okay, so it's going to be sub accounts. But eventually if I have other clients that are interested in that, I can just add them as like QuickBooks.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, subaccount three, subaccount four.
ANguyen: I have hundreds of clients on my login in QuickBooks, but they have access to their QuickBooks, but I hold the subscription.
Christian Sheerer: And you can still give them access to the nickel one as well so that they can approve if they want to be the ones in approving the funds going through.
ANguyen: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: Or you can approve the funds on your own, up to you.
ANguyen: Okay, sounds good. I don't think I have more questions. Do you have things you think I should know?
Christian Sheerer: I think it's pretty simple. I think it's pretty simple. I think what we typically do at this stage is we set up some time in between now and then. you go through, run your first couple of transactions, get signed up onto the platform, and then we can set up a check-in where we can troubleshoot anything. If anything got confusing, I can help fix it or just point you in the right direction. And then we can plan out like a longer term rollout if you have those next couple of clients outside of this one client who has two separate accounts, how you would go about adding those in and any error of the particular, you know, differences in details between them. So if you're comfortable with that, I would say you could get signed up. I'll send you a recap of our conversation that we just had. And I'd say you could get signed up within today if you wanted and start running those transactions. It's about two day turnaround for ACH, one day turnaround for credit card. You can offer both and push the fees onto the credit card payer, right? So that you're not, you know, incurring any of those fees or the client isn't incurring any of those fees. and link it up to QuickBooks. And then we get back together maybe next week, see how those transactions have gone, and then game plan out, okay, if you think that the next couple of clients that you think are the most relevant to get signed up, we can walk through those as like a step by step and just talk through their particular details. Obviously payments are pretty much the same across most businesses, right? But if there are any things that are relevant. And if you wanna talk about vendor payments, 'cause we do those as well. we can set up that time for then.
ANguyen: Okay, sounds good. Well, we've already decided to just go through the regular way they were doing invoices because the first of the month is already Monday and I'm going to be gone next week.
Christian Sheerer: So.
ANguyen: As soon as I get back, I'll probably set up an account and see how it works since we have kind of like a month from so.
Christian Sheerer: You guys process payments all at the end of the month?
ANguyen: Well, right now, this client specifically is doing it throughout the month because he's doing it through Chase and he has a limit per day. So that's why he's doing it throughout the month. He wants to do it all the first, like, earlier instead of having that. But he wanted me to wait and make sure he We also write an email to all his clients so they're aware that the date will change and they want to let them know in advance. So that's why we decided to keep going for next month for September so they don't have like 2 days notice that it's going to be charged $10,000 in their account the next week. So we're going to do that this month and do all the transfer during September for October to go the new way.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, awesome. So I think you can even run some test transactions that aren't maybe the real for clients ones.
ANguyen: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: And next week we can try a real client one. So you can run some test ones in between now and them. And next week we can try a real client one even on the call together if you wanted to just try out sending out an invoice together. And then we can do that. So I think in the meantime, get set up with the account, set up his two clients, client accounts sub. You won't have to pay that 35 a month yet. We always start with a 14 day free trial, so there's no sort of investment on your end yet. And then once we earn that trust based on those tests that we've run together and troubleshooted back and forth those questions, then you'll be able to get set up pretty quickly.
ANguyen: All right, sounds good. Let's do that.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. Yeah. What time works next week, do you think, to get together Thursday or.
ANguyen: Well, like I said, I am leaving tomorrow on vacation.
Christian Sheerer: Nice.
ANguyen: And I'm leaving for two weeks.
Christian Sheerer: Oh, you're gone for two weeks?
ANguyen: Yes.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, cool. Awesome.
ANguyen: It's going to be in the week of the 15th. We can do maybe Wednesday. That will give me time to work on it.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, cool. I'll give you some homework, which is very simple. It should take you like an hour to get set up in Nickel. It's very simple. I'll give you a recap of what we just chatted about in our game plan for running those first couple of transactions in between now and then. And then on the 17th, we'll troubleshoot those tests and then run some real ones.
ANguyen: Yes, sounds good.
Christian Sheerer: Cool. What time Wednesday? Where does the same time work for you? Is that good?
ANguyen: Wednesday 17th, I have a meeting at 9 hours. Yeah, I think same time.
Christian Sheerer: Does three work 3 Eastern rather than 315?
ANguyen: You're three hours, is it 330? Yeah. Where you are? Yeah, that's good. That's noon for me.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, awesome. Is that still okay?
ANguyen: Yes, that's perfect.
Christian Sheerer: Awesome. Okay, I'll send that over now. And I'll send over a recap shortly, and then we can get together in a couple weeks time and you enjoy your vacation. Okay. All right.
ANguyen: Sounds good. Thank you very much.
Christian Sheerer: Thank you. All right.
ANguyen: Have a good one. All right.
Christian Sheerer: You too. Bye.
