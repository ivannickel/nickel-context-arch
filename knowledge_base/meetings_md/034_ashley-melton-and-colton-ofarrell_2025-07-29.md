Colton O'Farrell: Hey, good morning, Ashley. Looks like you're on mute, by the way.
tov tea: Thanks. Stacy's here, too.
Colton O'Farrell: Hi, Stacy.
tov tea: We're moving because we're in a public space.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, you can always take your time. Let me know when you're in a more private area.
tov tea: You want to go over in that room? you want to go in that room right over here or do you want to go in that, like, sitting area right there? It doesn't matter. Let's go to the sitting area. Oh, look, two and a half times. Is 311 that we should be charging on it. It was 107 because we're not being charged the 15. Well, we don't know if I did charge the 15. We'll find out, but, yeah, it's 269 times. I think we leave it in the 285 range 290. If it's okay, we'll have to race again. Oh, there's somebody else on the phone. Thank you.
Colton O'Farrell: No worries.
tov tea: Agreed. I have to leave in like 15 minutes because Asha's gonna stay with you.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, nice to meet you. And it was Stacy.
tov tea: Yes, hi.
Colton O'Farrell: Nice to meet you, Stacey. Just introduction on my side. So Colton, Sales Partner here at Nickel. So I'll be understanding a little bit more about what's going on from an AR and AP standpoint in your business, kind of pain points that you have today. I'll go ahead and show you Nickel and walk you through that. I'll even set you up as a vendor or a customer on my end so you can see what it looked like for your customers. But if you want to just start explaining a little bit more about your business, how you found nickel, kind of what got you on this call today. I think that'd be a great place to start.
tov tea: We're a wholesale specialty tea company and we are being charged 1% each way from Lending Club and it's adding up. From QuickBooks, you're right, from QuickBooks.
Colton O'Farrell: I looked at QuickBooks online, by the way. Yes, got it.
tov tea: And I already linked it into a nickel account.
Colton O'Farrell: It's all that.
tov tea: It's showing my name as the display name. Can we change that?
Colton O'Farrell: Can Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Yep. So I'll show you that.
tov tea: Yeah, we're just trying to avoid the 1% and then another 1% fee.
Colton O'Farrell: Is the 1% that you're being charged via QuickBooks cap today at all, or?
tov tea: I don't know. We're really being charged 2%. Yeah.
Colton O'Farrell: Can you explain?
tov tea: The 1% QuickBooks charges 1% when somebody pays and then another 1% to transfer to our bank.
Colton O'Farrell: And your bank charges you another 1%.
tov tea: No, the bank doesn't charge it's all QuickBooks.
Colton O'Farrell: Okay, I got you. And you said that's not count.
tov tea: It's not what they advertise.
Colton O'Farrell: No.
tov tea: It's not what they advertise. We were surprised to figure that out.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, it was a change. How long have you guys been with QuickBooks?
tov tea: Sorry. A year and a half? Yeah, like two years.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah. Yeah, so about last- We were right.
tov tea: After the change to not cap it.
Colton O'Farrell: Right, so yeah, I think it was about last September-ish, they rolled out a new change. So a lot of these companies, it was like QuickBooks, Build.com, Melio, all these companies used to provide free ACH, and their customers love that. They were never charged for it pretty much overnight. QuickBooks switch, and after that, everybody else switched as well. So a lot of people went from paying nothing to paying hundreds or thousands of dollars in these fees made a lot of people really upset. And our company had been around already since 2022, but we realized the huge need there for ACH. So Nickel decided that we were just gonna offer 100% free ACH to all of our customers. We have a native integration with QuickBooks Online, so you've already activated that. You got everything to pull in there. We'll just go into account settings, adjust some of the information to better represent your company. But could you talk to me about to me a little bit about the workflow. So are you guys sending invoices from QuickBooks to your customer? They're paying and then you're being charged the fee.
tov tea: Are customers paying you any other ways?
Colton O'Farrell: Yes, check.
tov tea: Checks, how prevalent are checks in the business? Three are paying with credit card.
Colton O'Farrell: Sorry, go ahead with the checks.
tov tea: Yeah, how prevalent are they for you guys? Do you have at least five accounts? About five accounts paying check. There's only one paying with credit card almost. Right now, pistachio and Shakira are also paying credit card. Okay.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah. So on the credit card side, that's a kind of great segue. How are you guys handling, like, the credit card fees? Are you adding it as a line item?
tov tea: Yes.
Colton O'Farrell: And so are you handling the PCI compliance in for that? Or how is that working?
tov tea: That's a great question. I think I did. I did one, like, online thing, like, last year, and that was it.
Colton O'Farrell: Okay, gotcha. Nothing else since then. Well, then, I'm curious, so if they pay via credit card, what does that look like?
tov tea: What is the fee that's charged? It's 2.99% on top of the entire amount. Like, if they're getting shipping to that's included.
Colton O'Farrell: Okay, got it. Nice. And, God, we talked to you. So you guys don't currently have any kind of, like, payment portal for customers to access and make payments.
tov tea: It's just simply the QuickBooks. QuickBooks, okay. We could have that, but it's too much work. We don't want to do that.
Colton O'Farrell: That's on our Shopify, but we have it disabled. Because the only reason I mentioned that is we do set up all of our customers automatically with their own merchant kind of payment portal. Most of our customers will take that embedded in their website, completely customizable, but it will serve as either a one-stop shop for customers to make a payment or a backup method for a lot of our customers. If the primary methods are not working, But how we would work is all of your invoices would be pulled from QuickBooks into Nickel. We could turn on some automation to automatically send those to your customers if you want. So when you're generating that invoice, do you have to go through and make edits or revisions to it much or just? Yes. Okay, so in that case then we'd probably recommend turning the automation off. But I'm going to go ahead and just share my screen here quickly. I will walk you through kind of what it would look like. So you already did the integration, so you just went to Account settings, you click the integrations button here, you link to your QuickBooks account. So everything should have pulled in from an AP and AR standpoint with the AR being here. All of your invoices would be pulled in to quickly send these off via Nickel to your customers. You just come to payment requests here, click request payment. We will either send via email or via SMS. What your customer will get is this secured payment link right here. I'm just going to copy it and open it into a new tab here just so you could get a sample of what that will look like. But your customer will get, when they'll get an email, it will say, here's the invoice, you know, pay now. When they click the pay now button, they'll see your name, email, company branded logo, invoice name or number, invoice attached automatically from QuickBooks Online, and then the two options to pay. If they pay via card, there's a 2.99% fee. That's 100% paid for by the customer automatically. You can change that to be, you can change that percentage. of how much the customer owes to any rate. So you just go to into settings right here. So by default, 100% of that credit card surcharge is to be paid by the customer. But if you guys have a business model where you agree to eat that, you could change that. You want to see that.
tov tea: We don't need to add that 2.99 on our end because you're going to do it on your end.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep, we will handle that in the PCI compliance. You will just get the net amount.
tov tea: Yeah, we're good.
Colton O'Farrell: Cool. Yeah, so I just wanted to explain this is the global rule setting. You can actually override this. So if you have a particular account where you do have an agreement that they negotiated that you're going to cover some of that, you can just come into settings right here. There's on any of the invoices, you could disable credit cards altogether, could allow the customers to edit the payment amount, or you could override the global rules. So instead of having 100% of that charge, you could do 50/50 here just for this individual invoice and everything else then would be as the default 100% of what your customer is.
tov tea: We will never do that. If you want to use a credit card, you pay for it.
Colton O'Farrell: Right, exactly. That's kind of the philosophy for us as well and why the default is 100%. But we do have customers who want to have some control over that, so we do give that. But if your customer wants to pay via ACH via their bank, there's no fee for them or for you. It's 100% covered for all of our customers. They would simply have to enter their routing and account number, hit pay, and it would be complete. And it would, everything would pop into both Nickel here on a transactions tab on the receivable side, as well as everything would get into QuickBooks. It's like a one second delay between updates.
tov tea: Yeah, sorry, I'm putting you off, but when I integrated QuickBooks, it said that a link would automatically be generated when you create an invoice in QuickBooks. So do you also have to do this step or do you just set this up once and then from there on out?
Colton O'Farrell: Just create an invoice in QuickBooks. So you're in what you can continue to create the invoices in QuickBooks. You would just come into Nickel, where in this get paid tab and hit request payment to actually send them off via Nickel. And the reason you want to send them off from here is because if you send them through QuickBooks, they're going to charge you the 1% fee. We won't charge you anything. Okay. The payment portal.
tov tea: So you guys mentioned you had this, but it integrates and This automatically populates based on what we, the invoice that we hit send on. Exactly.
Colton O'Farrell: That's amazing.
tov tea: Okay, keep going. Yeah, of course.
Colton O'Farrell: So that payment portal that I mentioned before, not sure if it's something that you, you know, you'll find value in, but it is something that's just set up for all of our customers. You can simply find that right here, payment portal. You can copy this and embed it in your own website. This is all customizable. So you just go to account settings here, you can adjust the banner, your information there. But this would serve as like a one-stop shop or backup method for a customer to make any kind of payment. And a lot of our customers just have it on their website. So it's again, kind of the same options as before of what we saw in that email. What I'm also going to do is just create you as a customer on my end and send you Joe just what it would look like. So I'm going to go ahead and set you guys up as a new customer. Do you have access? What email would be best to send this to, by the way?
tov tea: Hello@tovtea.com. Hello@tovtea.com.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep. Cool.
tov tea: T-O-V-V or T-O-V-T.
Colton O'Farrell: Awesome. And then can you tell me a little bit more about your average invoice sizes? What's kind of the range that you guys are dealing with?
tov tea: A few hundred to maybe like a grand or two? Yeah.
Colton O'Farrell: A few hundred to like $1,000 or $2,000.
tov tea: Mm-.
Colton O'Farrell: Cool. So I'm gonna just go ahead. So we got you set up as a customer on my end. We're also automatically gonna pull all of your customers. from QuickBooks, so you won't have to worry about that. But I just added you manually in here. But I'm going to send you an invoice just so you could see what it would look like for your customer. So we'll call this 142-729-15 for $1,000. Do you do any kind of, I imagine it's all mostly one-time payments? Yeah. Okay, one time.
tov tea: I have to go in just a second. I want to ask you a few questions.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, please do.
tov tea: You said if there are no changes to the invoices, they can automatically go as long as we don't turn it on like the ACH and credit card toggles on QuickBooks.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, so what it would look like, my QuickBooks account is not connected because it's just a demo account. But when you connect your QuickBooks account, you would see this. So it'd say your name, your QuickBooks number, And right below here would be an automatic payments link. So if you toggle this on, what this is going to do is we'll automatically send- I already did that. Via Nickel, anytime an invoice is generated from QuickBooks, why it's not good to have this on if you are reviewing or editing the invoices a lot, it's you can toggle it on or off if you, the only thing is if you're going to change those invoices, they're going to get an email for each of the changes you made. That's the one.
tov tea: Yeah, I know. And I'm just laughing because I know you love it when they get the email.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah. But so that's something you can toggle on if you want to.
tov tea: Can you turn that off Ashley because I have to do invoices today? Yes. Okay.
Colton O'Farrell: Cool.
tov tea: So another thing that I'd question on, we have some customers set up with reoccurring payments.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep.
tov tea: Do those work in the same way? Because the invoices are automatically generated, same monthly.
Colton O'Farrell: So yeah, tell me a little bit more about the recurring. So it's monthly payments?
tov tea: Monthly, weekly, biweekly, it's usually biweekly.
Colton O'Farrell: It's not biweekly. It's like, yeah, so we can have it set up every month, every week, every quarter, every year. There's no like, you can have any kind of end date on there that you'd like. Are you guys doing any kind of payment authorization or like ACH debit polls.
tov tea: From your customers with prior approval? no, no, but we are doing. Well, kind of that credit card. That's a bank authorization. Credit cards different.
Colton O'Farrell: But do you have, do you have authorization to pull funds from some of your customers account that they get, like, maybe they said a transaction limit, but like you up into that limit, you can pull from their account based on invoices that they owe you.
tov tea: We, we have a recurring payment set up where we We believe that the client entered the credit card and details once and then it automatically is run once a month.
Colton O'Farrell: Got it.
tov tea: Through QuickBooks? Can we do that through you is my question.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, so we can set up. So I'm just going to pop open another tab here. So we can send your customer a payment authorization form. So when we're setting them up, this would allow, I'll show you an example of what it looks like. So I know you got to go.
tov tea: I think they're getting an invoice for it. So if they are getting an invoice, would it work automatically?
Colton O'Farrell: Yep, so it would just automatically pull from their account. So you can set up any of your customers. So when I was setting you guys up, you might have seen where there was a little box that said payment authorization requests. If I were to click that, you would have gotten it, you would get an email that looks like this. So it would say, you know, payment authorization requests from your company. If you want any kind of memo or note in there, you can add that. We have some frequently asked questions with answers right there, but if that was too long and they didn't read, We do have it again on the second page here, letting them know that this is an authorization for your company to pull funds from their account based on agreed upon criteria based on invoices that they owe. This tells them that, you know, Nickel is SOC 2 compliant, we have bank level security, built in fraud protection, everything's safe with us. All their money is in FDIC insured accounts. We're simply the processor. You always owe your funds, like you own them yourself. We are never taking ownership of that. other than to process them. But this authorization can be revoked at any time. You can set transaction limits. You can set when this is.
tov tea: It sounds to me like I do it through you, not through QuickBooks. Yes.
Colton O'Farrell: So we can honor, if you have payment authorization forms completed for other customers through QuickBooks, we can honor those. However, they might be slightly slower processing times just because our compliance and regulatory teams need to verify that. because with AI and generative AI, anyone can just create fraudulent payment authorization forms.
tov tea: My question though is, if we're doing it through you, then when we send them an invoice, is that going to mess things up because they're going to get another request?
Colton O'Farrell: No, so you're only going to send the invoices from Nickel. They're never going to get any kind of invoice from QuickBooks. And if you have some kind of authorization form completed with them through QuickBooks already, we are able to honor those. But what I was trying to explain is that they might be slower processing times to get that into your account because we have to make sure that-.
tov tea: I don't think we have access to those letters anyway, so we would just set it up through you.
Colton O'Farrell: Cool, yeah. Then this would allow you, your customer would come say, for example, you have a payment authorization for five grand with this guy. These guys, they would say that right there. They would simply click that. In this example, there's no limit. If there's an expiration date, you could add that, but all they would have to do is agree to those. They would click how they want to pay that. So if they want to set it up with ACH, with no fee, they could do that. And then up to that limit of.
tov tea: 5,000, you would automatically just be able.
Colton O'Farrell: To pull from their account.
tov tea: And another clarification.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah.
tov tea: I thought we were still creating invoices.
Colton O'Farrell: Through QuickBooks, but you just mentioned creating invoices through you guys. So you will create the invoices through QuickBooks. You just will not send them through QuickBooks. So you don't ever have to, you have the capacity to create invoices through Nickel, but you're not required to. You can continue to create them all in QuickBooks.
tov tea: You just need to send them via Nickel.
Colton O'Farrell: So how do you do that on QuickBooks Send? So in QuickBooks Send, you're just going.
tov tea: To create the invoice and it's automatically going to pull into Nickel right here.
Colton O'Farrell: Then we just create the invoice and.
tov tea: Hit Save instead of.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep,
tov tea: exactly. And then we get request payment from over here. And get it. Well, we don't have to if that's automatically toggled on.
Colton O'Farrell: That's fair.
tov tea: Exactly. If it's toggled on, you want to have it right now.
Colton O'Farrell: We have to finalize.
tov tea: Yeah, yeah, I know.
Colton O'Farrell: Okay, I gotta go.
tov tea: Yeah, no one.
Colton O'Farrell: If I have any questions, I'll email you. Sounds great, Stacie. Thanks so much. I'll have questions. What I'm gonna do actually is I'm gonna go ahead and just send that. Of course, yeah, my pleasure. I'm gonna go ahead and just send.
tov tea: That example so you can see what that looks like. So we'll just call this invoice 140.
Colton O'Farrell: Let's see. 143. And then do y'all have training modules somewhere online or like videos so she. Doesn'T have to ask you a lot of questions? So I do have a recorded demo video that's like six minutes of going through the like kind of the entire workflow with Nickel. So I'll share that so you'll be able to reference. But our product is, most people say it is extremely like intuitive and very simple. It only shows you what you need.
tov tea: None of the, it looks easy.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah. Yeah, so we designed it to try to be as easy as possible. So what I'm going to send you, this is just going to be a sample invoice just to demonstrate that you can, you know, attach that. If you're pulling them from QuickBooks, they're automatically pulling here, but I'm just going to put a quick note. Hi Ashley, please make the payment.
tov tea: Oh, it moved. Sorry, hold on. I have, wait, my do not disturb because I have people calling.
Colton O'Farrell: Oh yeah, no worries.
tov tea: Um, where are you? I lost you. Where'd you go?
Colton O'Farrell: No worries.
tov tea: Maybe here, yeah, no, that's just my picture.
Colton O'Farrell: Oh wait, I'm actually, this would actually be sent to Stacy, so maybe I want to put your email in here instead since she had to run.
tov tea: No, no, hello at the tov tea is me.
Colton O'Farrell: It's my picture. Oh, you'll get that. Okay, cool.
tov tea: Awesome, so I'm gonna hit those. We both have access to it, so you just have to send it once.
Colton O'Farrell: I just had to sign her up as Stacy, so there was a separate email. I gotcha, I gotcha, cool. Well, you should be getting that email any second now so you can see what your customer would see. And the nice thing is if they, in that email, if they hit reply all on that, you will actually be CC'd on any communication. So here's a previous example that I had.
tov tea: You'll see some of the distribution.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep, that's my demo account.
tov tea: Cool. Awesome.
Colton O'Farrell: And then it's very simple. They just hit the pay now, the credit card, there's a fee there, or they can pay for free via ACH. Wanted to quickly go over the pricing side of things with us. So I was curious, you guys had mentioned, so our pricing is not impacted by your company's revenue or how many accounts you're working with. Pretty much have two options, they're pretty straightforward. But I was curious from like a company revenue size and customers, what are you doing annually for revenue and how many customers are you working with?
tov tea: I think we're at, hold on, I don't remember. I just looked at this the other day. La la la la la because we've grown a lot. I can probably just do it. Hold on. Let me just calculator it, because I could go look it up in QuickBooks, but that'll take a while.
Colton O'Farrell: No worries.
tov tea: Let's see. If we are doing... Where's my phone? There it is. I'm so much faster on my calculator on the phone than on the computer.
Colton O'Farrell: I know it is.
tov tea: I'd say about 150 to possibly growing to 300,000 a year.
Colton O'Farrell: Cool. Awesome. So I think so we really have two plans available and I just want to kind of explain how these work. So you guys are currently on Nickel Core. This is the completely free plan that all of our customers get set up with. The only way that you would pay anything on this plan is if you agree to eat some of the credit card surcharge, like in this area here, or if you are using us to pay bills and you're using a credit card to do so, it's kind of the same rate. Sounds like you're mostly doing accounts receivable.
tov tea: Yep.
Colton O'Farrell: Cool. Yep. So some call outs to note on the free plan is you're allowed to have three active members on the account. You can do ACH processing up to $25,000 per ACH. So that's not cumulative, meaning you could do a hundred of those, you just cannot do one, 26,000.
tov tea: We're not that big, you're good.
Colton O'Farrell: And then the processing time, so as long as the ACH transfer is initiated before 4:00 PM Eastern Standard Time, it's generally a two to three day turnaround time to get that money into your account. There are some limitations on the free plan. So you cannot do scheduling payments, recurring payments, or the payment authorization requests that I mentioned. You do get access to the payment portal completely for free, but all of the restrictions I mentioned, those are removed on the Nickel Plus account. So it's either $45 monthly or it's $35 a month charged as a one-time $420.
tov tea: Let's do a core for now while we figure out If we, yeah.
Colton O'Farrell: So the only reason I would call out the Plus Plan for you guys in particular is if you're interested in the payment authorization like form and as well as doing like setting up customers with recurring payments or scheduling payments in advance. But basically we speed up the ACH processing. So it's same day to two day turnaround times.
tov tea: It's fine.
Colton O'Farrell: Cool. Yeah. So you'll be on the Nickel Core Plan. If at any time though you decide that you want to try out the Plus Plan, you can just come into your plans. Feature right here and upgrade. We give all customers a 14-day free trial of it. If you decide that, you know, it's more than what you need for your business, you can always revert back to the free plan.
tov tea: Otherwise, it's- Can we just stay on.
Colton O'Farrell: The core for now?
tov tea: Yeah, absolutely. Okay. Absolutely, 100%.
Colton O'Farrell: Because I will totally forget and then we'll have had the plus for like a year. No worries. But yeah, Ashley, let me ask you, what questions can I answer for you? Is there anything that's unclear? All you guys need to do in order to activate your account and start sending and receiving payments is you simply need to go to get paid and link your bank account. We do have Plaid verification, so that's something you'll likely need.
tov tea: I already did that, yeah.
Colton O'Farrell: Oh, you did? So you have your payment method linked as well?
tov tea: I believe so.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, if you want to pull or just double check for that, that's the only thing that we would be needing in order to start sending or receiving your invoice.
tov tea: Yeah, I have our QuickBooks. in our bank account attached.
Colton O'Farrell: Awesome. So you're ready to go. You can start sending any invoices from Nickel. We'll completely remove that 1% fee for you guys. But let me ask you, is there any other questions or clarification that I can?
tov tea: Right now, just the demo. I'm sure Stacey will have our own questions.
Colton O'Farrell: Cool.
tov tea: It looks straightforward to me.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, absolutely.
tov tea: And then we can continue to use QuickBooks for people who do want, like we have one person who's on a payment plan because they're behind. And so that's just an automatic they're paying $100 via link every week.
Colton O'Farrell: Keep that the same.
tov tea: Okay, because I'd rather not mess with it since they're making the payment.
Colton O'Farrell: Of course.
tov tea: Sounds great.
Colton O'Farrell: Awesome. Well, Ashley, what I'll do is I'll send that follow-up email with those resources. The last thing I didn't really cover is I kind of talked about this on a high level, but we do have our security and data protection information that I'll provide. This is just to restate of that all of your money is always yours. We're just moving it through FDIC insured accounts. We have built in fraud protection in the way that if anyone were to get so we make sure that we're not working with any kind of bad actors. Very efficient process for evaluating that. But how we work is we're really the ones on the front line. If there would be anybody that would try to hit your business from a nickel standpoint, All of the money that we're moving is in our own account with our own like processes as well as our sponsor. So you're liable for it.
tov tea: Exactly.
Colton O'Farrell: So you that's one of the biggest aspects of a lot of customers, especially if you deal with mail or check fraud. Nickel is the one who is on the hook.
tov tea: I used to work in financial crime.
Colton O'Farrell: So yeah, you I'm sure you are well aware. So that can people are awful. They really are.
tov tea: So that can hopefully give you hope in humanity. Like yeah, I had grandmothers who were drug mules or money mules. I was like, this is awful.
Colton O'Farrell: Oh my God, it's so horrible. It's really bad. And like, though, that's what I was talking about. Like, there's, you have no idea how many people will set up fake websites, fake companies, and try to look. Oh, but I do, I do. Well, you do know, yes, of course you would know, but most people do not know. Like, where do we deal with people who try to use us every day who are, who are clearly very, like.
tov tea: We have a investigations unit who handles all of that. And that's what I used to have to do. And then you have, like, human trafficking cases because everybody who's horrible uses a bank. Just, it's awful. Or they buy a whole bunch of.
Colton O'Farrell: Cash cards and yeah, so it's just, yeah, oh yeah, like gift cards or still people's credit card information running it. Yeah. So we protect everything though with that secured payment link that your customers receive. So we're protecting it with encryption, tokenization, Nickel's design.
