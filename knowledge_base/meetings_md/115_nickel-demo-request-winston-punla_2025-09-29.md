A: Hey. Hello? Christian, can you hear me?
B: I can now. How's it going, Winston?
A: Good, good, good. Yeah.
B: Awesome.
A: Can you see me?
B: I can't, but that's no worries.
A: Okay. Okay. I, I don't know what's, you know, wrong with. It says okay. No, that's okay.
B: I mean, okay. Unless you want, unless you want to turn it on. It's all good.
A: Anyway. Yeah. Yeah. Just to be quick, I'm really happy to stumble upon your site, you know, nickel, and I think it's what I've been looking for. I'm using AC8 for payroll, for employees, you know, to get paid direct deposit. So in May, I found Bill.com and probably, you know, who they are, you know, and we've been using them for I think 50, 15 weeks, something like that, without a problem until last Friday. So what happened is the employees didn't get their direct deposits. So I made the decision. I, you know, I'm looking at their thing and there's a lot of, you know, complaints. I didn't know this and I think it's time to move to a different direction. Okay.
B: And so that's just for payroll. How do you usually get.
A: So the net. The net, Christian. So what happens is, for example, you know, your, your paycheck is 3,000 and your net income is 2, 200. That's all. I, I go to build.com and put your net, you know, the employees net and make sure the totals are correct, meaning the, the grand total. And then I, you know, I schedule it. So.
B: No, no, of course, no.
A: Yeah. So there's nothing different type of question.
B: So my, so where I was getting at is basically our breakdown. I mean, sorry, our founding story as Nick was like around industrial kind of built world payments in general. We didn't set out to be a payroll company in the first instance. Some of our customers use us to pay their contractors. And, and there are like a host of different payroll tools we think that we could build. But what we're primarily doing is the transaction between businesses. And that's where we really sort of.
A: Oh, I, I understand.
B: So I'm wondering. No, and, and, and so I'm, I'm wondering how you guys typically handle those types of payments, like to your vendor or from your customers.
A: Yeah. Okay. So there's two sides, you know, in accounting as, you know, receivables and payables. Yeah. So just treat instead of getting paid through Square, of course, you know, square and you know, other platforms. That's one half of the story. No, I'm not We're not using it for that. We're using. We want to use nickel to payables. Don't say employees anymore or payroll. Let's just say we want to pay somebody, you know, Winston or Christian. That's it.
B: No, I understand, but what I'm. What I'm curious about is, is how you guys use what, what, what do you use square for your accounts receivable?
A: Yes. So we use square. I think that's one. That's for credit cards. And then we use. Of course, there are. There are customers who pay with checks, and then there's customers who pay with cash. Very minimal, you know, like 1 or 2%, but most of the transactions are paid with. With credit cards, you know, and right now we're using square. So.
B: And why. Why is it that you're using square? Is that just the first one that you found or.
A: Yeah, I. I think it's the first one that the. The one running the show is the owner and I'm the accountant. Okay. I'm an accountant here in, in San Mateo. And when I spoke to Bill, they want to put the. For example, I'm the main account holder, and all the companies that I handle, they want to put it under my account. So actually, my. I've got three quick questions for you. Is that how you want this setup or it's better to just set this up. As I said, this is for sss, trucking or transport. Okay. They do concrete pumping here in Hayward, California, you know. Yeah, so I'm on the other side of the bridge. I'm in San Mateo. I've been an Accountant here for 35 years, since 1990. Probably older than you.
B: Beautiful. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
A: So I'm stable, you know. Yeah. 850 fico score and everything. So when I tell people the same phone number, the same email, the same address, you know, I don't. I'm still here. I enjoy what I'm doing. So it's a quick. And also, I've got a software company, a payroll software company. So I understand a little about it. And the reason I'm talking to you this morning is, as I said, I'm excited to build.com, as its competitors are saying, on the Web. They're an old. They got an old software, you know, like. What do you call that software? Like the legacy software, like written in. In probably Windows something, you know, and. And now we use Python and, you know, so. So that's the reason their, Their application is very cumbersome, you know, So I just want to use the Achievement portion. I'm clear with that. Right. Christian, I just want to use the ACH portion of your thing because sometimes like QuickBooks, they got a hundred features and we accountants, we actually don't like QuickBooks, you know, because we, they got 99 features and we only use one or two. So that's all I want to use with nickel.
B: Totally fine. Yeah. The reason I was asking about the other ways that you guys accept payments is because what we can do. And I'll show you, I'll go into the, into the platform now let me connect up other monitor and I'm not.
A: An expert with zoom, so you can probably.
B: No, no, it's all good. You'll just be able to see my screen in a second. So just. I'll ask you if you can in a second. The reason I was asking about those other kind of functions is because we've set up the platform in a way where you can sort of handle everything in one spot, AR. ACH, credit cards so that you don't have to balance different platforms or different processes for all payments coming in. So if you wanted to get paid with credit card ach, you can send out invoices through nickel and you'll give all of the options to the customers there and then they'll be able to pick whichever is easiest for them. If you're getting money sent out to vendors, right. You would set up, I guess your vendors. I can see there as those people, right. You know, the people, the employees of SSS or what have you. And you could also go into different ones of your clients accounts and so that we will separate them out so that they don't have, you know, the risk of commingling funds across them. But you have one login to be.
A: Able to handle AP and Sure, that's, that's the idea. Put everything instead of using different software and apps, you know, different accounts payable, a different payroll software, a different billing software, you know, how, how a lot of businesses are set up. So that's wonderful.
B: Yeah. So our, the idea is that we, we find it's pretty time consuming to juggle between those different software. So if we have it in one place, it's a little bit easier. Do you guys use, you still use QuickBooks though, even though you're not.
A: Oh, no, no, I've never. You. I, I find it easier to do a spreadsheet. I'm a real accountant, so I use trial balance. I don't know if you had an accounting class, but that's where I, I put, you know, I summarize transactions. And, you know, transactions are either deposits or payments as they. You see them in the bank statement. They're either withdrawals or deposits, you know. So that's where I summarize it into accounts and put it in the balance sheet and the P. L. Okay. I think it's much better doing it than. Because I always. The bottom should always be zero. When it's zero, that means it's balance, you know, to the penny, you know. And the. The problem with QuickBooks, it's, you know, Intuit said it themselves, QuickBooks is for non accountants. So you input and you know. But you know that there's. They're talking about this AI Thing lately, and we're laughing. It's like when I started my tax preparations practice. Somebody came to me, Christian and I, and said, this was in the 90s, Winston, I don't need your services. I said, why? He said, I bought what you call that tax act or something like that, you know.
B: Yeah.
A: Oh, really? It's a good, you know, yours is a simple tax. So you do it in, you know, TurboTax. And then one week later, he came back with his tail between his legs. As a Winston, I can't figure out this capital gain. So. So in other words, you can have your tool, Christian, but if you don't know how to. You can have a fault. Gulf Stream, you know, you don't know how to fly it. You know, you.
B: Yeah, of course.
A: Okay. So I make fun of people saying in. In 10 years, this. Things will be, you know, will be obsolete and nobody will. These kinds of jobs. And I'm laughing, you know, probably with lower cases, but complicated accounting, you can. You can do it with AI I don't think so. But anyway, yeah, why don't we do this? I'll tell the owner. Okay. So is nickel a competitor of square or what?
B: I would say so. I think square is primarily built to handle small transactions.
A: Really? Yeah. The only thing. Let me tell you this, I don't mean to cut you. The only problem I have. Everything in our accounting system is excellent. The way I look at it and other people. The only thing that's not complete is the accounts receivable, which is the square. So because it's too. To me, the girls who use it see it as complicated. In other words, the reports should balance. Right. They just total it. And I don't think it balances. But since I'm not handling that one, you know, I don't really have much control. But I want to have control. Of course, with the billing and receivables. So is it possible to start with ach? That's my question. And eventually move our billing and receivables to nicim to.
B: Absolutely.
A: Yeah.
B: You can always start with whatever you want. You could use any kind of portion of.
A: No, because if you help me here, I, I lasted 35 years. The same clients who are loyal to me for 35 years because of how I do business. You know, so I'm telling you now, Christian, you know, if, if I think Nicholas, the, you know, I. I want the software. As they say, a software should be easy. Like my. My payroll software's name is quarter filer. You know, all you have to do is put your employees, their rates, address, whatever, once and you know, you do the payroll every week or every 15 days, whatever, without any problem. It doesn't have a sub. Sub menu. You. You know what I'm saying? It doesn't have. Others have menu. They got 30 menus. You know, mine is only. It's got like four. Four menus. You know, the company, the employee and the paycheck itself and the reports. That's it. So people find it very easy to. And you don't need a technical, I mean a sales support or whatever. Technical, whatever. Because to me, a good software. You don't need support. Right. Right now. If your software always has a problem or a kink, then, you know, then you do need. And Bill is so Bill.com is terrible. You know, when you need support, they don't even have a telephone number, you know.
B: And yeah, and we, and so we, we. We have support. I think it's. It's pretty foolproof for people who might, you might not need to ever use it because all you have to do is come in here, make a bill. You can create vendors, you can set up a new bill for that person. And so for example, for these people that you're paying ach, you just come in, you enter their information or you can ask them to enter it and then you'll be able to. To send checks.
A: Yeah, that's. That's so another thing. The reason sometimes I can get into like newer, newer companies like Ramp or Nickel or Melio, I'm sure you know them, is that they're asking, you know, for example, my email is Gmail. They're asking for a company thing. Of course I've got a company Gmail. I mean a company email. So will. If I start. Let's say I want to set up SSS with you after we talk or later this afternoon. Do I need a company email or I can use a Gmail at least. I know aol, AOL and Yahoo are anti. Right. I make fun. I even tell my clients to change their, you know, their email into Gmail or something. But will Nickel, you know, be okay with us using a Gmail or. Or what?
B: Yeah, you can sign up with the Gmail. You will still have to put in company bank account information.
A: Oh, yeah, yeah. I'm just talking about the. The email. Yeah, that's with the. With Melio and before. Actually, it's just yesterday or. Yeah, that. I mean, this week that I found Nickel, you know, which made me happy. The one when I type ach, of course, the one showing is build.com and then ramp and that Melio. The problem is I really want to go with Melio before, but they were asking for what you call that accompany email. And, you know, so that's the difficulty. That's how I ended up with Bill.com. but now that this thing happened, you know, the owner is very understanding. He said, don't you think we should give them one more chance? And I said, I don't think so because it's the second time they made a mistake. And, you know, Murphy's Law, whenever you're away, you know, I was out of the country last week, Christian, and I found a mistake, you know. Oh, yeah, it was in Europe. It's always it. And then last Friday, when the girl told me that the employees didn't get the direct deposits, I was just about to cross San Mateo Bridge, you know, and go to Hayward and. And give them checks. But then the owner is in Mexico, so it's Murphy's Law. Things like that happen when, you know, when the key people are out, you know, and we never had a problem, as I said, for 15 paydays, and then suddenly, you know, when we were out of the country. That's as if they have a radar, knowing that the accountant and the owner are not. Are not here, you know.
B: Yeah, of course it'll go wrong. Yeah, no, I hear you.
A: So what the. So I think it's better because, of course, SSS is a big company. You know, it started from 1 million, 5 million. It reached 8 million last year. So probably, though the economy slowed down this year, probably it will again reach 8 million to 10 million. So I think they should sign up by themselves. Right? You agree with me.
B: Well, why would they sign up by themselves?
A: No, no, no. Because with Bill, they want customers to sign under my name, under the accountants, under the.
B: Okay, yeah, yeah, it's up to you. I mean, it's, it's really up to you.
A: Yeah.
B: Like if they sign up. So like you're saying if they sign up on their own, then they'll have a separate account, but you can have an accountant's login where you still have a separate SSS and then maybe another client. It depends on how you want to interact with Nickel. If you know his name is Bob. If Bob wants to come in, you can set him up as, you know, having access to the particular sss. And then the other client individuals can have access to their specific client account that you have within your breakdown. So.
A: So signing up should be easy. So it's up to you.
B: Do you want to. Do you want them to have a separate account sss?
A: Yeah, I guess so. Yeah. Because I don't want them to mix with my other clients. Right. Or with.
B: Well, of course. But we've set it up in a way where you can have an accountant's account that you can log into all of the different clients accounts and it's still going to be separate. Right. One bank account for each one or however you know the specific bank accounts for that particular client.
A: How about starting since we're only talking about them now, I've got probably two that I will recommend to you. So for now it's sss. So why don't I set it up? You know, so if I set it up, of course I have to set up the company, their information, their bank account. Right. And the number two, I have to set up their vendor so their employees. So that. Let's not get.
B: Yeah, yeah, I got you.
A: I. I'll. The, the payees, I'll set them up. You need their addresses, Social Security, whatever. And, and they're of course, routing. And an account. Bank account. Right. Is that correct? So set that up. One, two, three, and then I'm ready. Number three, I'm ready to pay them. Right. Okay. So yeah, by the way, there's 80. Now let's go to the pricing. There is usually. I counted their, their weekly, Kristen. So some companies, of course, pay twice a month. They pay weekly and they got like 15 to 16 employees. Okay, so in one month, how much is that? About more than 30. More than 30. About 60, right? About 60 paychecks. 60 payments. So how much will that be? What's your pricing structure?
B: So ACH is free.
A: Really?
B: Yeah.
A: I can't believe it. When I was. It says, winston, transfer your payroll to do. I know, fees. And I said, but, you know, as a business, people of Course, I want you guys to make money. I don't want to take advantage of you, you know.
B: Of course it's $35 a month to use the software.
A: Okay, thank you.
B: We make money on the take rate for some credit card transactions. So we're interested in. Because we think it'll be easier for you as well, you know, if you're.
A: I recommend you already, you know.
B: No, of course, but. Because one.
A: But I'll. I'll recommend to the owner.
B: Yeah, no, absolutely. And so it's 35amonth for the platform. ACH is free. There's a 2.99 on accounts receivable fee that you can pass on to the customers or you can pay as the business itself. And there's 2.9% on AR. Sorry, AP. So if you're paying a vendor with a credit card, it's 2.9% if you're receiving card payments from.
A: How about if I'm paying the vendor from our bank account? I can do that, right?
B: Yeah, of course. It's ach. That's free.
A: Oh, that's free. Okay. Yeah. So we'll go from there. We'll. I'll sign up, definitely. I've got two other. But I'll just cancel them, you know, Christian, so. Absolutely.
B: Nice.
A: I'm here in San Mateo probably, you know, a lot of this startups even ramp. Also they're in New York now and, and they all started here. I can't believe it. You know, I was looking at their history, but. So are you located in New York or. If you don't mind. Yeah, yeah.
B: I mean, we're in Brooklyn.
A: You're in Brooklyn. Oh, okay. Good. Yeah. So all I need is I'll. I'll just ask the owners, you know, to, to help me set up the, the thing. And for the employees, probably I'll just have one of the girls set them up so that. Oh, how's the. Do you know the delay of the thing? For example, with Bill.com I started using. Of course, you'll understand the flow. I started using it 15 weeks ago and I put. I inputted on Tuesday and they said the employees will be paid on Thursday. So I adjusted it because of course, the payday is every Friday, as I told you.
B: Yeah.
A: So I inputted the input date, the input date on Wednesday. They called the following day the process date. So the process date is Thursday. And available. It's just available Friday. So we never had a problem until yesterday when they were trying of course, to lie or whatever, saying, well, with ach it takes three to four days. I said, nobody told me that. This is the first time you told me that. And then the owner last night came back and said they already debited him last Wednesday. Look at that, huh? They debited him last Wednesday. And the employees didn't get paid until now. So I, I don't think nickel works that way. Right.
B: So no, ours is a two business day turnaround on ACH and one business day turnaround on credit card.
A: On credit cards. Okay. So I do it on Wednesday. They get paid on Friday, right? Yeah. So if I can pay them on Friday with nickel, that would be wonderful. Christian.
B: Yeah. If you, if you got set so that, that's what we can talk about. Now I think I have to hop in two minutes, but I think it should be pretty simple to summarize. It's pretty easy to get set up. I've worked at places where I tell people, hey, you have to get, you know, four weeks ready to be able to set this software. But this is something that you could really start to send out a transaction within an hour, maybe an hour and a half, two hours, just putting all the information and getting all the verification done. That I would say would be my kind of.
A: And, and we're both easy. You know, I asked you all the questions probably that you wanted to tell me about the pricing, you know.
B: Yeah.
A: 100 turn around and you know, I.
B: Think that would be my, my prescription is, is get set up today. I can give you a recap email that we can, you know, kind of centralize our communication under and get signed on, link the bank account, be ready to send out the vendor payments. I would say, you know, maybe you can send them out today and then, yeah, we can get back and make sure you're.
A: You're contact stays with me. Your contact information, of course, since you're the first person who helped me with Nicolin. I appreciate you, Christian.
B: Oh, of course.
A: Yeah.
B: No, I appreciate you taking the time too. And. And then we should set up some time to get back together just to troubleshoot any things that may have come up in your initial run through on. Do you want to try to do that for Friday?
A: Yeah. And sure. And as I said, why, you know, pretty soon give me. Of course I don't want to promise. Other people will promise quick, but give me some time and pretty soon probably we'll be running all our stuff with you, you know, even the receipt.
B: I mean, that's what we can set up for that call. Like we can troubleshoot the initial transactions and then chat through what other kind of, you know, processes that might be useful to switch over to nickel. Do you want to set some. Do you want to do the same time on Friday?
A: Friday, I think it would be a little early, you know, if you can make it at 10 o', clock, that's fine.
B: What about, what about 12 year time?
A: Sure, sure. Cool.
B: I'll send that over and I'll send over. After I get off these next couple calls, I'll send over a. Yeah, an email kind of recapping what we chatted about with an agenda for what we should kind of review on Friday. Plus think forward about the future of like, okay, here's how we can do the relationship. More stuff for sss. And. And then we can chat through the specifics of the other clients as well.
A: Okay. Christian, you have a nice. Oh, Monday.
B: Yeah, you too.
A: It's a Monday, you know, so you have a nice week ahead and I'll chat with you on Friday.
B: Awesome. Alrighty. Well, yeah, and then I'll be very available to it in case anything comes up as you're going through your setup.
A: Yeah, I got your email. Thank you.
B: Wonderful. All right, Winston, thank you very much.
A: Thank you. Bye. Bye, bye, bye.
