Jacob Greenberg: Hey, Jimmy, can you hear us?
alexhoehe: Do it right.
Jacob Greenberg: Hello.
Jacob Greenberg: Hey, how's it going, guys?
Jacob Greenberg: What's up?
Jacob Greenberg: What's up?
Jacob Greenberg: Sorry, I'm having a little bit of volume issues. Give me one second here.
Jacob Greenberg: All good. Hello?
Jacob Greenberg: Can you guys hear us?
Jacob Greenberg: Hey. Yeah, can you guys hear us?
Jacob Greenberg: I do have John in the room with me here. Christian.
Christian Sheerer: What's up, John? How's it going?
alexhoehe: Apologies if you heard my rant.
Christian Sheerer: Nah, not at all. All good.
Jacob Greenberg: Closer now.
Christian Sheerer: So I. John, are you working with Surgeon X or are you primarily with the new venture?
Jacob Greenberg: Both. Oh, awesome. Okay, cool.
Christian Sheerer: And so I brought Jacob here. Jimmy and Alex and I have been working on kind of getting Nickel set up for Surgeon X. But per the kind of question Jimmy laid out yesterday around point of sale system stuff for Abel, Richard, that's why I brought Jacob on, because I was in the room with him and he's like, oh, I know a lot about light speed. So I'll have him introduce himself. I mean, he does the same thing that I do here at Nickel, but has a background in that realm. And then we can sort of let him kind of deep dive on that with you guys specifically about pos all things pose.
Jacob Greenberg: Good to meet you, Jimmy and John. So, yeah, like Christian said, I have some experience with lightspeed, but I definitely like to learn a little bit more about the venture that you guys would like to be using it for and understand like your ideal workflow. And, you know, we can work backwards from there. Would you give me some more background on it? Yeah.
alexhoehe: So April Shard is an ultra luxury brand. We also are partnering with Monte Grappa. Our CEO is partial owner of that. Both are very high luxury items. Products start at around $200,000. And I think the average product of Monte Grappa is probably around 3 to $5,000. It will. Richard is new, but Monte Grappa has been around since 1912. So they're going to be in both. Both brands are going to be in each of our boutiques. We have one opening up actually in a few days. And on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, we have one opening up in a few months in New York, Miami and then as well as London. So obviously. Right.
Jacob Greenberg: The.
alexhoehe: The biggest issue, not issue, but the biggest challenge is getting. Is getting a high limit on ach transfers now. So we use. Sorry, that's just the background of who we are. How it works is lightspeed communicates to Netsuite currently. And we use an integrator called Innate Sync. So once a transaction is completed. Right. Every 15 minutes, that syncs with NetSuite as a cash sale to do these. We've messed with Stripe before. Stripe is a pretty powerful platform. Now to generate those custom gateway links within lightspeed. You can create.
Jacob Greenberg: They're called.
alexhoehe: I'm not sure if you guys know a lot about NetSuite, but you can create these suitelets within NetSuite. It acts as a gateway. So we have an ACH payment. So you upload that URL or that suitelet URL into lightspeed. So when that payment method is selected, it goes to netsuite, opens up that suitelet, and then it then will. It will open up like a Stripe checkout, or I guess in Nickel's case, hopefully a checkout from Nickel. And then once that's completed it, then it communicates with Stripe or whatever platform that we go with that the payment is pending, it succeeded, and then that will then communicate back into NetSuite. So the integration is pretty, I don't want to say super complex. A little bit more complex than just kind of syncing transactions.
Jacob Greenberg: Right.
alexhoehe: And then I think maybe the more difficult side is like. Right. So I try not to delete anything because, you know, especially if you run a script to delete something, something is probably bound to go wrong. So when. Once you. Once the payment is completed within lightspeed, every 15 minutes, again, that gets synced into Netsuite once the status changes in Stripe, and I'll just keep using Stripe as an example. But if the status changes in Stripe, that communicates back into like a custom record within NetSuite, kind of letting the accounting department know that, hey, this is right. It's succeeded or the payment has gone through. The ADH has been cleared, but it doesn't add another transaction within NetSuite. So it's. It's like a sync, or I guess we're barring the capabilities of Stripe, but it's not a true sync. So then. Right. Obviously we don't want to double up those transactions.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, that makes sense. Okay, I have a couple questions and so just bear with me. I think I need some more clarity on a couple parts of this. Are you guys. Are you using Stripe as an example, or is this an integration you guys already have set up with LightSpeed and NetSuite?
alexhoehe: So we do have the integration currently there's just some pitfalls with Stripe. So that kind of led us back to you guys. I heard some pretty good things. They're not.
Jacob Greenberg: Well, Right.
alexhoehe: One, I heard your guys's customer service was fantastic. So obviously working with clientele that is ultra high Luxury. Like right. We're doing volumes of $200,000 in one transaction.
Jacob Greenberg: Right.
alexhoehe: So we're just kind of not so much shopping around because obviously we have. We're in time crunch at this point. But yeah, just trying to see what everyone offers and, and then go from there.
Jacob Greenberg: When you say time crunch, what is your timeline to have a solution like this?
alexhoehe: So right. We have about. I'm gonna say, I mean in reality we probably open up next week. Now that's just for the Beverly Hills location, but. Right. We're gonna open up phase one, four locations is Beverly Hills, Miami, New York and London. There's four phases in total, each with either four to six new stores. So whatever is easiest for the future and whatever we can guarantee less road bumps.
Jacob Greenberg: Right. Okay. And you started explaining some reasons why you don't like Stripe. I know that poor customer service was one that you mentioned. Are there any others that we need to be aware of?
alexhoehe: Not particularly. One is like right. To get an ACH limit increased you have to go through this pretty rigorous review. Obviously that's understandable. Certain point. But I don't want to have to do this for every single account especially. Right. Because it's the hard part of a new company is we don't have any data currently. But we are partnering with Monte that has had data since 1912.
Jacob Greenberg: Right.
alexhoehe: See some of that paper. But yeah. So I think that's probably the biggest downfall is I don't want to keep doing that over and over and over again.
Jacob Greenberg: That makes sense. Are a lot of these transactions at the point of sale going to be ACH transactions ultimately or are they going to be primarily credit card?
alexhoehe: I think there's going to be some credit card is like. Right. Some products are in the $5,000 range, so I'm assuming those will probably be handled by credit card. But some products will go up to probably $900,000. So I'm expecting either ACH or wire transfer with those much larger transactions.
Jacob Greenberg: Copy. Okay. As far as the use of Lightspeed, is this really just for tracking inventory since you're not going to be using lightspeed to process any of these payments, is what I'm understanding where you were.
alexhoehe: Currently using light speed payments just for credit and debit.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. So your idea here would be on those odd situations where there are five thousand dollar lower cost transactions, people have the opportunity to use credit card using the Lightspeed point of sale system. But when you guys want to generate like a higher value transaction, you want to get a custom link to be able to do ACH or wire transfer. And for that, you're going to want an alternative solution to Lightspeed.
alexhoehe: Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: Right.
alexhoehe: One source of truth is obviously the end goal.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, copy. And you guys have already signed a contract for Lightspeed Point of sale at all these locations?
alexhoehe: No, not all the locations. Yes, Stripe is nice in the way of there's really not a contract. You kind of just sign up and then you can close your account anytime.
Jacob Greenberg: For Lightspeed. Not for Stripe. Sorry.
alexhoehe: Yes, for Lightspeed. We have all of them open except London. I'm just waiting on some paperwork.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, gotcha. And walk me through the workflow that you're imagining. So essentially the idea is someone wants to purchase something, it's ACH or it's a $900,000 transaction. So you enter that product into the Lightspeed Point of Sale system. It's going to auto generate an invoice via Stripe that's synced with netsuite so that you could provide a Stripe link for them to pay that way. And then you're going to share that via text message or email or just on a screen that you guys have for them to enter that information. And then they'll enter in manually in the store.
alexhoehe: So in the. In the pos, you'll have. Right. You'll have different payment methods. So, like, right, you have credit card and then an ACH button. So once they click the ACH button that connects with Stripe and then it presents the client a QR code. So they scan the QR code and they're brought to the Stripe checkout page.
Jacob Greenberg: Interesting.
alexhoehe: Yeah, so we try to keep it as. Right. So because of the high transactions, we obviously want to be as PCI DSS compliant as possible and easy and sleek.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, got it. And are there any. So you're not using Stripe for credit card, you're going to be using Lightspeed for credit card. Are there any costs associated with using Stripe for credit card or for ACH transactions at the point of sale?
alexhoehe: For this integration for ACH, it's $5. For wire transfer, it's a cap, $8 for lightspeed payment credit card, we have. We have a 2.6 processing rate plus 10 cents.
Jacob Greenberg: Got it. So I understand the, you know, desire to avoid using credit card with Lightspeed because it's going to be incurring quite a significant cost over time. As far as Stripe goes, it's just $5 for the ACH. And then the rest of the integrations run seamlessly so that your big reason to avoid them is just the poor customer service or requirements to continue to seek ACH limit increases. There's nothing else that you guys are trying to solve for?
alexhoehe: Yeah, right. The biggest one is obviously just that ACH limit. I contacted customer support once and then all of a sudden I got six different people like reaching out to me asking all these different questions. And I think that it probably took an additional week answering the same questions just until somebody said, oh wait, someone else is already handling this.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay. Yeah, yeah. Stripe's a big, big operation and I think the larger we get, the harder it is. Yeah. So as far as our current capabilities, we won't have an immediate build out. Possible to be able to integrate directly into Lightspeed so that it shows up on the page when they click on the ACH button. We do build outs and it is something that might be worth our team evaluating, but it won't be within a one week timeline. I can just guarantee you that if it is something you guys would be considering for down the lot because I know that we're going to be working together on Surgeon X, potentially other venture ventures that you guys have and I know that this is something you guys are currently kicking off. It might be interesting to loop in our tech team to be able to put this on the project prospectus and see a roadmap of what it would mean to build out something more custom for your use case across these four or five different locations you're going to be launching in phase one. I don't know exactly what timeline that would look like or if it is feasible at this time, but it's definitely something I can guarantee would be interesting to our development team. We just have to see where it's going to land on our roadmap. In doing so, we obviously save you the $5 per ach, which is a pretty nominal fee. Hopefully we could create a way that makes it efficient for you guys to process credit cards more affordably as well, because I think that would have a bigger impact for your business. The one thing I do know personally from Lightspeed though is Lightspeed is probably the biggest stickler in the POS industry when it comes to contracts and it's just something to be wary about as you move forward. They very rarely enforce them, but they'll threaten to do so if you're using a third party provider for processing or if you decide to cancel the contract early. Typically in my experience is a 36 month term term agreement that they offer for the point of sale system and if you attempt to cancel or do anything by using third party, what they want to do. And I've never actually seen it enforced, but they do become pretty annoying about it is they attempt to charge you in advance for all of what they expect their revenue to be from your processing over the next 36 months. So it's just something I'd be aware of moving forward when using third party vendors for processing. I think that Stripe could get away with it if you're only going to be using achievement. But it is a pretty neat solution you guys have where it automatically generates a QR code for them to fill out. I can see that being something that we want to develop. It's not something we have out of the box at the moment though. Would you be more willing to like begin a conversation?
alexhoehe: Yeah, that's fine. So that's, that's just all custom code within NetSuite. So the only thing I really need is a payment link. So as long. But I didn't see any kind of public API on your guys's side unless. Unless you guys do have some public API access or documentation I can look at. But yeah, I mean, even Stripe doesn't integrate directly into Lightspeed. We just feed it the payment link into NetSuite, generate the QR code and then just from either webhooks. We don't even need web hooks. But just through API access we're able to kind of communicate everything back and forth honestly.
Jacob Greenberg: So we have a couple ways we can approach this. You've already seen into the nickel solution, right? You're a little familiar with the way it works?
alexhoehe: Very little, but yes.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, gotcha. And sorry guys, am I talking to John or Jimmy right now?
alexhoehe: Oh, this is John. Sorry.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, perfect. That makes sense because I know Jimmy had some demos in the past with Christian. I believe so. Okay, great. I'm thinking two things right now. If you wanted to get going with nickel at your first store location or even at multiple locations, it might not be an automatic process, but you can get going to solve for your solution and be able to use the Nickel solution pretty much instantaneously. It would be a slightly manual process. But I expect that at a luxury store where you're selling $500,000 products, it wouldn't be, you know, out of, out of the norm to do something like this. So I could walk you through what it would look like to generate the individual invoice for that individual transaction and why it might be a better branded experience for your customers once they decide to pay as well. But it does sound like that type of thing because I was misunderstanding the level of automation that you currently have with Stripe, we would probably be able to build that quicker using webhooks. I would just. Again, it'd be a conversation we bring up with our development team to see how long it would take to execute on does that, does that make sense? But I could show you what it looks like to generate the invoice manually because I think that might be your best solution if you do want to get going with nickel by the end of this week.
alexhoehe: Because you could do that and I guess. Well, and how long would it take to get that? I guess. What's your guys ACH limit cap?
Jacob Greenberg: I don't believe we have one. The thing is what we would also need to. So I want to not provide any final information here. I definitely want to connect with the team internally to see what we could build out for you guys. But the information you provided today is going to be helpful for that conversation. So I'm going to take it to them. I do think that it is helpful that you're in a partnership with another company that has historic transaction records. I also think that it will be helpful once you guys get going with Surgeon X and start processing with that front. And we know that these companies are related and under a similar umbrella. That could also provide some leverage here to be able to increase that ACH gap off the bat. But really it's just about getting you guys transacting in the beginning. It's a little bit harder when it's a net new company that doesn't have a transaction history. Right. So I think there's a couple of different ways we could approach this. One would be getting activated on certain genexa as quickly as possible, doing a couple of transactions at least. I'm not sure if you guys have already signed up and activ activated the account. At the very least that might actually be enough to be able to get our uncapped ACH also being able to. If we are partnering in one degree or another with this other luxury brand, if they're able to provide some background or transaction history or create a nickel account of their own, even if it's going to be just utilized through your new brand Abel Richard, then that could be another avenue we could take. But I think the best next step here is for me to take this to my internal development team into my CFO here and see what we can do to get you guys activated quickly with that ACH limit. But that's definitely a problem we're going to be able to solve for you. If we do partner for the long term.
alexhoehe: Yeah, that would be fantastic. We have like. Right. We have documentation with. With Monte Grappa. We have again, documentation kind of of the partnership between Monte Grappa and Abel Richard. They're operating out of the same boutique. They're all. Every store is going to have a Monte Grappa in the evil Richard boutique. And.
Jacob Greenberg: Right.
alexhoehe: It's not that we're splitting the profits. It's all. All profits go to April Richard. And then as well as in the future, I'm gonna say probably maybe mid-2026 to late 2026, we're going to be also doing E Commerce for Abel Richard and we're also going to be taking over Monte Grappa's United States E Commerce.
Jacob Greenberg: Got it. Okay. Got it. Yeah, I think that would be definitely something that would be interesting for our team to develop some solutions for as we move forward. Would you. Would you consider using nickel if there was an ability to support your E Commerce operation down the line?
alexhoehe: Yeah, I mean, right. I mean, thank you guys for jumping on fast. So I.
Jacob Greenberg: Right.
alexhoehe: I greatly appreciate that. Whatever is. Is seamless.
Jacob Greenberg: Right. I mean that's.
alexhoehe: That's the only thing I feel like any business really wants.
Jacob Greenberg: So.
alexhoehe: Yeah, absolutely.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. What is your timeline to be able to launch the e commerce component of all this? I just want to make sure that we're in lockstep with your projects moving.
alexhoehe: We have a pretty good amount of time before that. I would say budgeted is. Is mid-2026 and I think that will be able shard and taking over the United States for Monte Grappa completion before 2027. I can say pretty confidently.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, I gotcha. Do you guys have projected revenues for the in store locations versus the online e commerce locations?
alexhoehe: Yeah. So for. Yeah, we don't have any projections for E Commerce yet. One step at a time. But for Monte Grappa alone, for all of our three locations, just the United States, New York, Beverly Hills and Miami is. Is going to be, I would say 4.7 million. And then Abel Rashard will probably be about 5 million.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. Cool. Yeah. All the information that I could get from our call today is going to help me navigate this conversation with our team internally, map out some project pipeline and advocate on your behalf to, you know, expedite a little bit. So I appreciate the info.
alexhoehe: I appreciate that, Jacob. Thank you.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, of course. No, this is an exciting project and I think it's a cool use case for nickel that we definitely had on the roadmap that isn't Pre built and out of the box at the moment. Like if you do go to our pricing page, get nickel.com pricing, you'll see that we have a custom section. And Christian and I have actually been working with a lot of customers recently. There's been a lot of requests to do like custom ERP integrations, custom CRM integrations and the like. We have started doing some builds for E Commerce, but it's definitely going to be a big year for us in 2026. I just want to make sure that we're prioritizing you guys and have an understanding of what the timeline is going to look like. So let's take this back to our team. Christian and I will have an internal conversation with our CTO and our CFO about this and see what we can build out for y'. But it's exciting that you guys are expanding. It's a cool new business. Hopefully you guys are. April, Richard is doing handbags. Is that what it is? That what it is? Yeah.
alexhoehe: It's correct to start. Yep.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. Cool. All right. Hopefully we could come visit you guys in the New York store one day.
alexhoehe: Come on down.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, that'd be fun. All right, cool. So I feel like I have a good understanding what your current setup is, what your ideal setup is going to be, and what a long term project might look like together for E Commerce as well. I know your timeline is to get up and running with Beverly Hills next week. Let me show you in the meantime to put it in your back pocket what a manual process with nickel without the web hooks or the integrations would be like. But knowing that I'm going to go back to my team, have a conversation and see if we could build something out for you guys.
alexhoehe: Okay, sounds good.
Jacob Greenberg: So, Jimmy, you might have seen all of this already, so I apologize if any of this is redundant information. I'm sure Christian covered absolutely everything that I'm going to be showing really quickly here. But I think it'd be helpful to show John a little bit of the background on nickel itself because I do think that there is a world in which you guys can just pop this open and keep this running within the store when you begin to do sales in person for larger transactions. John, this is going to be your summary page. You'll see navigation on the left hand side here. Transactions is a quick overview of your recent transactions. But for this project, you'll be living out of the get paid section here on the left hand side you'll see customers here. But this is mostly when you're going to do Repeat businesses with a B2C or B2B businesses. You guys are mostly going to do individual processes out of the store for individual invoices. So essentially we have two options for you here. One is very simple and we could customize this and this might be a solution alone, but I want to show you two different ways we could approach this problem. When you sign up for nickel, you do get a payments portal. And this is going to be customized with your logo, your name, your branding, your banner, image, et cetera. And this page itself can also be customized the types of fields that are going to be entered here. So if you are in store, you could just have an iPad or a screen where someone enters that payment amount information and what they're purchasing, reason for payment, or whatever custom field you actually want to include. Here you can include anything and you can have several different pages of information. Then it will bring them to the Pay by Carter, Pay by bank section. And if you do share this out as a link, what we could also do is enable Apple pay option. But this is more of a generic payment method for generic payments of any types. So you can put in that basic information and choose to pay by car. Choose to pay by bank. This Pay by card option, this is a core tenant of Nickel. Nickel charges a 2.99 service fee for using credit card. Should your customer elect to use credit card, you have the complete ability, regardless of state and local laws, to charge whatever you want for that percentage up to that 2.99%. So if you wanted to take 1.5% and pass 1.5% to the customer for the ability to use credit card, you have that ability to to do so or to customize the card rates. This will all sync back into Nickel and you can export any of the transaction records you want as a CSV and import them likely into netsuite should you want to. This is if we do not build that integration or webhook capability so you can still accept these payments in store. I'll show you one. This is just top of mind because I helped these guys the other week set up their payments link. They have a payments tab here. They put a little bit of customization into it. So they had a second page here where you'd enter the account number, company name and specifically they requested remittance instructions for their reconciliation process. But again, this could be in literally anything you want. You can include a video here, you could upload an image, whatever it is, and then you fill out the information and it will Go to checkout. So that's one simple solution for a more customized branded luxury experience. I actually think that the typical workflow with Nickel might be pretty pretty for you guys. Hold on, let's see. I'm going to. Give me one sec. I'm going to log into a different demo environment that has some information in there already.
alexhoehe: And do you guys have public API or is this kind of all handled through that custom custom price?
Jacob Greenberg: The only out of the box API that we have is for QuickBooks that anybody can go ahead and sync to. We don't have a public facing API, but we do build out custom APIs for customers. What we've actually been finding more recently is that it makes more sense most of the time to do AI Agentic Syncs or webhook syncs just because it's quicker to build and it actually secures the private information a little bit better. Instead of sharing information two ways as like an open faucet between the systems, we're only pulling and pushing the vital information that's required on a case by case basis. It's also typically a little bit quicker to build, but we have projects underway for API, AI Agentic Syncs and webhooks, all the different types. Okay, let me show you really quickly what it looks like to generate an invoice because I do think that this might be a nice experience for your customers in store. So you can go ahead and when someone is checking out, say they're purchasing a $500,000 item or a $200,000 item, you'll come in here and you'll add or you know what I'll do, you'll add their information and you'll request their email information or their phone number. I'm going to put mine here so I can show you what it looks like. You can put an invoice number or you can put a purpose statement if you want to. I'd imagine for this you'd want to put a purpose statement. So you'd say, you know, handbag or whatever, the person, the clerk at the counter would put in the amount of money for that transaction and you'd set it as a one time transaction. You put any notes for customers here. You can standardize this if you want to say thank you for shopping, adding or a shard or whatever text you want and you could upload any images or documents if you'd like to. This could be nice so that you could have like a automated sales receipt or maybe something custom that you like to send out like a PDF that can be saved. Regarding a Burchard, this is totally brandable and customizable for you. Now, the cool thing here is you can enable the customer to edit the payment amount, which means if they wanted to pay for part of this transaction in ACH and the other part in credit card, they have the ability to do that. You can also customize the fees on that receipt. So this could be globalized. Like I was saying, you could customize whether the customer pays the whole 2.99% or pays a portion of it. And then you just click Create. So it takes two seconds. You just enter the customer information and the amount and what they're purchasing. We automatically generate a payment link and you could share this via text message to the customer while they're standing there in the store so that they have the privacy to fill it out on their phone and make the payment there. Or you could send it to their email, or you could just generate this link and bring it up on the screen. I'm going to send it to my email just so that you guys know what that looks like. Ignore my messy inbox here. So this will say, you know, Abel, Richard, your company name and the purpose statement that you enter. It will have an image for your logo. It'll have the company name and this is actually a link that will relink back to your website, which is a pretty nice branded experience. Now this very sleek custom, you have a new payment request. Abel or Shard has requested a payment from. You know, this could be a generic business email and any memo. Again, this also looks really nice on mobile and can be sent as a text message. And here will be a branded experience with your logo, your company name and contact information. The ability to pay by card, pay by bank, but also to do Apple pay if they want. They also have the ability if you want to enable it. Again, this is totally customizable and up to you. You can enable them to be able to customize the amount so that they could decide to pay half of it or a portion of it in credit card and the other portion by bank, which is a pretty nice customer experience. From there they could just enter this information. Most people can auto enter this information as well from their phone, especially if they're using credit card. Or they could just double tap if they have Apple pay and their cards synced on their cellular device. Alternatively, if you don't want to send it to them, you want to provide a little bit more of a branding experience in store. You could have a, you know, iPad that you use as A terminal and just open up this link directly in that iPad and it will present like this. So really it only takes five seconds to generate that transaction. It's completely specific and branded to that customer that will be paying multiple hundreds of thousands of dollars for a unique product and it will be automatically stored as information on your transaction level. Here it's a next day turnaround time for credit card and a two day turnaround time for ach. And you can see all of your active, completed or future scheduled transactions for this. You'll probably just be using completed and active sections here and not scheduling anything in advance. Again, all of your transactions are downloadable by CSV so you guys can do your end of the day reports on a daily basis just by clicking today, filtering and downloading anything that populates. I haven't made any transactions today, so this page is empty. It also creates a really nice way for you to manage on a customer to customer basis who you've been engaging with over time, what they purchased and when and keep track of all of that information. So if you do want to do manual exports for daily reports and just push that into netsuite, you're absolutely able to do that. And if this information is all that's required to push into NetSuite, I imagine that it would be a pretty quick and easy webhook build on our end for automations like pulling up a QR code that's like immediately associated with something punched into the point of sale system. That's probably going to be a longer conversation on a longer build out. But frankly I think in the meantime just entering the information in the point of sale system so that you have record there might be helpful. But I think you guys might have the ability to think outside of the box on this one being higher value transactions as well. Again, it only takes a couple seconds to generate that invoice. I'm going to pause here and see if you have any thoughts on this process. Is this completely insane and not gonna not fit your use case at all?
alexhoehe: No, it's definitely nice.
Jacob Greenberg: It.
alexhoehe: I mean it's presented very well. It's honestly it's just the, it's just the integration with the suitelet is the big thing.
Jacob Greenberg: So. Right.
alexhoehe: We obviously want somebody to click a button in lightspeed that brings them to a custom URL or gateway URL. So like right. Hypothetically it would be I click the button in light speed and then I get this view and then they can select right. Pay by bank with the item already populated. So yeah, we would just, we would just need to figure out that type of integration or. But as long as we can figure that out, then I. Then this would work perfectly.
Jacob Greenberg: Awesome. Okay, so that's the conversation we need to have then internally, do you see a world in which, just out of curiosity, where you enter the information into Lightspeed just for record keeping, it generates the total amount and then the cashier or the clerk goes into nickel and populates an invoice on their own using that information.
alexhoehe: What do you mean by information?
Jacob Greenberg: Like.
alexhoehe: Like client first name, last name, email, phone number, or are you talking about banking and routing number?
Jacob Greenberg: I mean, I'm kind of imagining neither actually. Just product. Product information. So I mean, I guess the way that I'm imagining this is if they need to go into Lightspeed to be able to find out the cost of that item and to register that as a transaction in Lightspeed, they would open up Lightspeed, they would enter the items that are being purchased. It would populate the amount for that transaction. And in Lightspeed, there's that button that you could click that is, you know, other payment typed and you just click other so that it marks it as, you know, you could even customize it so it says nickel and you just enter nickel. And then they would step away from the Lightspeed point of sale system, go into the nickel system, create a new invoice, add that customer information, ask them for their email, and then they'll see the price that they need to enter on this invoice from the point of sale system and they'll enter it here and then they'll just go ahead and create the invoice and that's it.
alexhoehe: I mean, yeah, the only difference between this and then like right, Stripe, for example, is it automatically pulls the customer, customer information and amount from that checkout in Lightspeed.
Jacob Greenberg: Well, the customer information wouldn't be in the checkout of Lightspeed yet, just the amount. Right. Because the customer hasn't made the transaction yet.
alexhoehe: No. So during, once you select the product, it's in our SOPs that they enter in the customer information. So first name, last name, email, phone number, any other kind of information. So, right, you enter in the customer, you select the products that you want, and then you hit pay. Then you click on that payment method. So let's like. Right, let's just say stripe again. Click on stripe. And then it pulls all that information. It pulls the client information amount. It automatically puts all that information into stripe.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, so I guess that, yeah, this is much simpler than I thought it was going to be, actually. So it seems like if you theoretically wanted to get running with Nickel, by the time you open up Beverly Hills, you would be able to have the same SOP with LightSpeed you would select custom payment type. You know, there's a third option, I don't know exactly the vernacular that they use with Lightspeed. I know with Toast it's other payment option. I think that Lightspeed, it's the same thing actually. And then you select that you could customize it so that it reads nickel and then the clerk will just step in to another tool, maybe another computer, not the point of sale, and create the invoice within Nickel using the information they already collected from LightSpeed, zero out the transaction on Lightspeed and actually process the transaction with Nickel. Keep the record of it within nickel and you'll have a downloadable CSV for daily, weekly, monthly or annual reports that you can import into NetSuite using CSV. So really it's everything that you guys want with the ability to use Nickel. However, it's just that one extra five second step of re entering basic customer information into the Nickel platform. It would still make it easy for reconciliations. It's going to align that transaction type and customer information with the information that you put into Lightspeed to begin with and then so theoretically you can start with that process by then this week. It's just a five seconds added to each hundred thousand plus transaction and it provides a little bit nicer customer experience at the end. That extra manual work won't be on the customer, it'll be on the registered clerk. Then what we can do is we could begin to have this conversation internally to see if we can automate that webhook process so that they don't have to do that five seconds of extra labor.
alexhoehe: Yeah, yeah. It's just that I guess that one manual step, I mean. Yeah. Could you then could you just get all that stuff together and send it over to us and then we can bring this up with our VP of finance and CFO and see if we can make it a reality. Sure.
Jacob Greenberg: Just a couple questions. That extra step, like as it stands today without the integration or the webhook, which you know is definitely something we'd want to look in automating for you guys. Besides the five seconds of extra labor for the clerk to be able to enter it, is there anything that you think that would prevent this from being part of your new workflow?
alexhoehe: I think the only other thing would be I saw that you have to manually type in your bank details now. I guess that works for wire transfer, because I think that's the only way to really do that. But I know for ach, there's a lot of things that you can connect just directly to your bank instead of doing the routing and like. Right. This is just me being nitpicky, obviously, but entering your. You log into your bank, Ray. It's just another step for us to prove that, hey, this is you.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah. So we can enable that on your customer side. We'd use plaid, which is the industry standard. So they would just select their bank, press the button, and then log in through their bank, and it would just process.
alexhoehe: Oh, that's great.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay.
alexhoehe: Thank you for that.
Jacob Greenberg: But besides that, I mean, it seems like that extra couple seconds of work for the clerk seems like a pretty big payoff as far as the ability to use nickel. Save that per transaction money and customer experience. What would you need from me to provide to you? I know you wanted some resources to be able to bring to your team to make this pitch. What would you need from me to provide to you for that to happen?
alexhoehe: Ach limit.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. Any other materials or information? Nope. Alrighty. That's pretty straightforward.
Jacob Greenberg: Simple.
alexhoehe: Sweet, man.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah. All right, cool. We. Christian and I are actually at a conference today. We're out in Nashville here, so we got. We got to run to a couple other things. But tomorrow we could connect with our CTO and have a quick convo with the cfo and hopefully we can have something for you guys by the end of this week, if not the beginning of next. Does that sound all right?
alexhoehe: I appreciate that, guys. Thank you very much.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, of course. Okay, cool. Awesome. Does anyone else have anything else they want to raise before we go?
Jacob Greenberg: No, sounds good. I did want to let you know, Christian, that we are looking pretty good with nickel for surgenics. We did accept and process fully our first payment, so so far, this look is looking good.
Jacob Greenberg: And we.
Jacob Greenberg: We're still set to have that touch base in two weeks and try to see if we can get a. An upgrade to that. I believe it's the pro is the middle one on the pricing plus. The plus. Yeah, we're gonna go ahead and upgrade to the plus because we are going to need more users on the platform, but other than that, I think going good so far.
Jacob Greenberg: Cool.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. And you can do that whenever.
Jacob Greenberg: And then you'll. You'll.
Christian Sheerer: It'll start out as. As 14 days free of it. But yeah, if you want to chat.
Jacob Greenberg: It through in a couple weeks, you can do that too.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, sounds great.
Jacob Greenberg: I just had One final question, guys. That's unrelated to everything we talked about today. Is a company VTech Labs, part of the Surgeon X family? Is that related? V E T E K.
Christian Sheerer: Yes.
Jacob Greenberg: See that?
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah. Vettech.
Jacob Greenberg: Correct. Yes, gotcha. Have you guys evaluated using Nickel for that platform or would that not work for that. That side of the business?
Jacob Greenberg: I don't believe we've raised any concerns or heard any concerns about pivoting their current payment processing procedure to Nickel. But I mean, as it stands, we currently use Nickel for surgenics. So if they did raise any concerns, more than likely nickel would be the first point of contact.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, if we.
Jacob Greenberg: If we know it works for surgenics and let's say we work with Abel Richard on nickel and we know it works for Abel Richard, I don't see a problem with this.
Jacob Greenberg: Bringing this.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, bringing this up in the future.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, awesome. And then one thing that we could do for you guys when you start to set up different locations on Able Richard, actually I forgot to show you this. I'll just show real quick because when you do have a family of businesses, it's helpful. Let's see. Ah, I'm actually in the wrong demo environment to show this. However, what you would essentially be able to do is you'd have an Abel Richard login, Vet Tech login, and a Surgeon X login, and they're all different. For April Richard, we'll be able to have what's called a clients tab in between the summary and transactions tab, so that an administrator on the account would be able to have access to different Nickel accounts per location of your stores. So each store will be able to only access what is specific to that one store. But you know, an admin or someone at headquarters would be able to have an overview of each of the individual locations that might be helpful for you guys when you start up with Abel Richard. Just a. Just a side thought, but yeah, besides that, we'll get back to our team and we'll have some information for you by Friday or by Monday.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah, sounds great.
alexhoehe: Thank you very much.
Jacob Greenberg: Thank you guys so much. Have a great rest of your day.
Jacob Greenberg: You too.
alexhoehe: You too.
