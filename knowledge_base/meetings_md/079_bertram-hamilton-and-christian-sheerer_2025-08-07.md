Christian Sheerer: Hi. Bertram. Hello. Yeah. Hi. How's it going?
Bertram Hamilton: Yeah, I'm fine.
Christian Sheerer: How are you doing well? Staying busy. Can't complain. I'm gonna go camera off, too, then, if that. If you don't mind.
Bertram Hamilton: Oh, okay. No problem.
Christian Sheerer: Cool. I guess tell me a little bit more about BRH Ventures and, like, what you think Nicole can help out with.
Bertram Hamilton: Okay, we are construction company. We provide roofing siding and gutter solution in South Florida. Okay, we have gutter systems, roofing services, siding installations, protective coatings, sheet metal works. and emergency repair services connected with this list of services.
Christian Sheerer: Okay.
Bertram Hamilton: And yeah, and right now we're finding for payment solutions that can take care about us, payment provider to pay ins and maybe pay outs if your company can or any ERP with Features, time and billing, you know? Yeah, and that's the reason why we called... Nickel.
Christian Sheerer: Cool. What is the usual, like, how do you guys accept payments now? What's the usual process for doing that in the accounts receivable side?
Bertram Hamilton: Okay, before we use QuickBooks, but if that is a trouble we use we left from QuickBooks because it's awful customer.
Christian Sheerer: Service.
Bertram Hamilton: It'S high hidden fees, it's high cost for low quality. And after that we left from. And right now we are taking payments in manual mode. We have processing history with QuickBooks, but right now we left and it's all like pen and paper mode and we need to switch that.
Christian Sheerer: Pen and paper. Yeah. Okay. How many, what's the typical kind of transaction amount across different parts of the business? So like for gutters versus emergency services, are they all the same? I guess walk me through what the typical transaction amount is.
Bertram Hamilton: Yeah, I think typical transaction is for the roofing or siding. Roofing and siding is most popular services in our company.
Christian Sheerer: No, what's the amount?
Bertram Hamilton: Oh, what's the amount? Average amount, I think it's approximately nearly 5,000.
Christian Sheerer: 5,000 a year?
Bertram Hamilton: No, of course not. Per transaction.
Christian Sheerer: Okay. Yeah.
Bertram Hamilton: For a whole roof. By the year it's near a million.
Christian Sheerer: And near a million for the year. Yeah.
Bertram Hamilton: That is revenue.
Christian Sheerer: You guys probably have around 20 customers? No.
Bertram Hamilton: 20 customers per day, you mean, or per month?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, let me just do the math real quick. So 5,000 times 2,000. no yeah so if you're doing 5,000 a month that's 60,000. 5,000 not per sorry 5,000 per roof yeah that's 60,000 a month so around like 16 customers does that sound about accurate Because if you're doing a million a year.
Bertram Hamilton: Yeah, around.
Christian Sheerer: Cool. And then what is it? So you're saying money going out, what are you guys typically paying vendors for?
Bertram Hamilton: Oh, we pay vendors for most popular payments. It's going to materials. I think it's going to vendors who provide us roofs, part of roofs.
Christian Sheerer: Any.
Bertram Hamilton: Instruments that we using for.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. Okay. And so. And so I'm looking at the website, All American gutter protection. Is that your website?
Bertram Hamilton: No, of course not.
Christian Sheerer: Of course not. Why? Because I'm seeing on LinkedIn, Bertrand Hamilton, All American gutters, went to Ohio State. Is that not you?
Bertram Hamilton: No, it's not me. I'm living in Florida, Coral Springs.
Christian Sheerer: Okay. Do you have. What's your website? Okay, cool. Interesting, because there's another Bertram Hamilton, same name.
Bertram Hamilton: Yeah, I think in America, it's. It will be more than.
Christian Sheerer: Oh, you made. You must have made this in. What's it called? This looks like a nice little lovable situation. So who's, are you, is who's, who's Michael?
Bertram Hamilton: Who is Michael?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, Michael Monsev.
Bertram Hamilton: It is my partner.
Christian Sheerer: Cool. Are there any of them involved in kind of the accounts receivable accounts payable process?
Bertram Hamilton: Uh, no. Right now, no, I'm. I'm all nervous. Only I can make decision at this time.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, cool. Awesome. And so I guess. Where. Where did you think that we could help out?
Bertram Hamilton: Yeah, I think you can be company who can take care about us in payment processing. If we can create an merchant account with you and after that we... Yeah.
Christian Sheerer: It looks like you guys tried to create an account in June. Did you not find it useful?
Bertram Hamilton: I think I had missed some demonstrations or something about it.
Christian Sheerer: What would you need to get demonstrated?
Bertram Hamilton: I think I had a conversation with your company, but as I know, no one's reached me back or something around and a little time ago, I have called all companies that don't reach me out and we booked a demo for today.
Christian Sheerer: You said you were on paper and pen, so there hasn't been a solution in between June and now. I guess what did you need demonstrated that made you not go through with the setting up process?
Bertram Hamilton: I think I missed your question.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah. So. You told me five minutes ago you were using paper and pen. Yeah. So you guys set up in June and then you said you deactivated because in June, You didn't have anything demonstrated to you. What do you need demonstrated?
Bertram Hamilton: I think I need to see.
Christian Sheerer: Full.
Bertram Hamilton: Pack of AP features of Nickel.
Christian Sheerer: Sure, I'll show you quickly. And then I think best case would just be try to get signed up and like test it out. On your own. There's just a little bit, there's like a lot of coincidences going on. Like BRH is kind of clearly like a lovable website you guys just spun up. Bertram Hamilton is also a guy who has All American Gutters started about the same time as you in Florida in 2011. And so I'm trying to put these things together. And also just curious why you guys signed up and then didn't go through with setting up your account if you.
Bertram Hamilton: Are reading the paper. Yeah, I think it was any type of troubles. I really can not remember what was in June. I have so busy month and right now we need to.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, I got you. So if you're sending out a bill to pay vendors, Right, you just click in, find a vendor that you need to pay, whoever it is, enter the payment amount, and then deposit to them. Right, make that payment, pay via card, ACH, etc. And then we need to know where you're going to deliver it to, what account and routing number they should be able to send you that. you can also pay by card.
Bertram Hamilton: Okay. Can your company receive ACH or only credit cards?
Christian Sheerer: Yep, we can do both.
Bertram Hamilton: Oh, yeah, fine. That sounds great.
Christian Sheerer: Awesome. Yeah, I think probably the best would be to get set up and test it out, and then we can reconnect when you have When you have. A. Couple of test transactions go through the account.
Bertram Hamilton: Okay, so you mean I need to recreate my account on Nickel? After that, I will get a trial. After getting trial, I need to make some transactions, and after that, I need to write you, yeah.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, I think that's probably the best.
Bertram Hamilton: Yeah, of course. I got it. I got the plan. Thanks, Christian.
Christian Sheerer: No worries. I will chat to you if you have any questions. Yeah.
Bertram Hamilton: Okay, you can reach me out on my email or on my mobile phone. Thanks. Have a good day, bye.
