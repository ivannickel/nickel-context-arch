Jacob Greenberg: Hey, Nathaniel, can you hear me? Okay.
Nathaniel Seekins: Hey, Jacob. I can. You've caught me on the road though. Afternoons.
Jacob Greenberg: Well, I hope I don't say anything too shocking that's going to cause an accident.
Nathaniel Seekins: I hope not.
Jacob Greenberg: All right, great. Well, okay, good. I'm happy we can make some time to connect. I have 45 minutes on the calendar here. I'm not sure it'll take that long, but is that all right with you?
Nathaniel Seekins: Yep, of course.
Jacob Greenberg: Fantastic. Let me just pull up my notes real quick. It's been a super busy day. Where are you headed?
Nathaniel Seekins: I'm actually headed back home. I was just checking out a bunch of rental properties that we own.
Jacob Greenberg: Oh, nice. Very cool. All right. Okay, great. So the purpose of our call today is to kind of sync and see. I know that nickel is going to be useful for rolling out. Regardless of the integration capability for your teams, you're going to be saving what we're estimating together to be at least $130,000 annually across the boatyard and metal fabrication company. I haven't calculated anything for return on investment for using nickel for bakery. I know a lot of that is point of sale, but it'll probably add some convenience and cost savings on the AP side at the very least. Definitely. So right now I'm just talking about savings because it's easier to calculate for boatyard in the metal fabrication facility. One second here. Gotcha. And you guys are currently on zero at these locations, correct? Or you're transitioning to zero. I'm sorry, Catch me up.
Nathaniel Seekins: So the boatyard is transitioning to zero from QuickBooks Desktop. The bakery is currently on zero and we don't own the metal shop yet. We are under contract to buy that.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. And do you know if what they're.
Nathaniel Seekins: Using, they're using some industry specific software and we'll. We're gonna move towards zero with them as well for accounting purposes. I don't know what they're, you know, what the production side will look like after we get done, but get there.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay, cool. All right, so I had some internal conversations. What we want to do is we want to partner with you guys. So this will be an open conversation based on how we found the middle ground that would make the most sense for you, make the most sense for us to be able to have the integrations that are time saving and cost saving across the portfolio. Hopefully you guys are going to grow. Hopefully we could grow with you and continue to support you guys.
Nathaniel Seekins: For your.
Jacob Greenberg: Transition over to zero. I took a note, I'm not sure if this is accurate, three to six months, or is it longer than that for your transition over to zero for boatyard and once you acquire metal fabrication.
Nathaniel Seekins: Yeah, so the boatyard, the boat yard is definitely like a three month six. Six is probably the outside, but yeah, three to six months for sure.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. Okay, three to six months.
Nathaniel Seekins: We'll be running parallel with QuickBooks for a little while as we, as we build the back end, basically.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha. Okay, so at first glance, the timeline that we would have to implement this integration for you guys would be a three month integration timeline. There's a good chance we could knock it out beforehand, but we want to allow enough time to be able to make sure that for each of the organizations that are using it, we're supporting it at adequately. So the conception when, if we decide to begin, it'll be at most 90 days from that date. So that seems to align pretty well with your transition over to Xero. For these organizations, the cost for the implementation, we're looking at a $30,000 implementation fee. But that is not per organization. That's for across your entire portfolio and for what other ever other organizations you're going to want to add on at that point we have multiple ways where we could process this. It doesn't have to be upfront, it could be over time. But and that's just a one time fee. So even with that one time fee, we are estimating that you're still going to save roughly $98,000 a year by switching to nickel. Calculating for that 30,000 coming out of the 128,000. And then after that you know, the savings in the ROI will increase for the following year.
Nathaniel Seekins: Yep, that makes sense. So just to be clear, this would be a, a zero integration. So invoices that were generated in Xero to be sent from Xero would have payment links from nickel on them.
Jacob Greenberg: Correct. So you would have any type of customization you want. It's essentially guaranteeing a two way instantaneous sync between your accounting system and your cash flow management system, which will be nickel. So you can generate the invoices from nickel. If you prefer, you could generate the invoices from Xero. If you prefer, you could send them out from nickel because it's going to be more convenient to do it better branded experience for your customers. And then the payments will be made through the nickel portal and automatically and instantaneously be updated within your accounting backend as well. And if you're integrating Xero with any other ERP systems or CRMs, the information that will be flowing through the Xero and Nickel API will also be updating the rest of your tech stack.
Nathaniel Seekins: Right, yeah, that makes sense. Okay, cool. I'm trying to think how that would flow with the ERP we have right now. Because what we're doing right now with the Boatyard ERP is that we are. We're processing all of our payments outside of Xero. It's a web app and so it will. It directs customers to a payment page with the. Just the amount to be debited.
Jacob Greenberg: Right. And that currently is all coming from your ERP at the moment?
Nathaniel Seekins: That's right. Yep, yep.
Jacob Greenberg: Do you know what ERP that is for the boatyard?
Nathaniel Seekins: It's a. It's a custom built one. I don't know what. What it's running on.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay. And you want to integrate that into Xero when you do the zero rollout?
Nathaniel Seekins: It does. Right now they've built a connector to zero. So it's syncing customers invoices, estimates and sales items. Yeah, the goal there with that one was that. I think the goal was. It's been a while now, but the goal was to have payment processing happen within the app and. And then it just sync back to zero for bookkeeping purposes.
Jacob Greenberg: Got it. Okay. Yeah, that's. That makes complete sense. And that would be a good workflow. So the difference with Nickel would be you're generating the invoices from wherever you want, frankly. It could be from your erp, it can be from zero, or it could be from Nickel. As long as there's an integration between your ERP and Xero. If you create it in your erp, it'll populate in nccl. You'll be able to have all the features of like selecting all the unsent invoices and sending them all out at the same time with Nickel. So that it's like a very smooth experience. Saves time as well. And once those payments go out or are paid at each and every stage, it will update the rest of your tech stack as one be saving the payment fees.
Nathaniel Seekins: Now what. What would you suggest? Because right now as it's built and we have not rolled this to customers yet, we're kind of doing internal testing right now. But as it's built out, when a customer approves an estimate in the erp, they are presented. If the estimate includes a deposit, they are then directed to a payment page for them to pay that deposit right then and there, which uses Stripe right now as the payment processor. And so in that way it doesn't. It currently does not touch zero until that's been made. Yeah.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah. So what we would do, there's a. The thing with this is there's a ton of different ways where we can approach this problem, but we'll create the same type of seamless process. Whatever your ultimate goal is, we'll be able to design around it, and it'll definitely be like. So I could show you some tips and tricks, walk you through demos inside Nickel for use cases that are, like, out of the bag, able to implement right away, or when we begin the integration process, you could have more technical conversations to see if we could build something more unique for you guys. But that process of. Once it's approved, that approval will still happen within your erp. You guys can have a generic payment portal to accept the deposits, which will sync with their accounting system on your back end. And that could just be used for every single deposit, if you would like. Or you can do a generation of an invoice and maybe even automate that invoice generation. If you do want that to be tracked in Xero as well, you guys can, you know, turn that on for your own integration. And that would also be a pretty seamless experience and probably what I would advise as like, the best use case for your company by having everything tracked each step of the way. But if you don't want to do that, there's a lot of other ways to approach it.
Nathaniel Seekins: Sure.
Jacob Greenberg: Yeah.
Nathaniel Seekins: Lots of ways to skin the cat.
Jacob Greenberg: Exactly. Yep.
Nathaniel Seekins: Okay. Hmm. Cool. I think I'll need to do some number crunching and see if that kind of implementation fee is, you know, is feasible for us.
Jacob Greenberg: Okay.
Nathaniel Seekins: And then I also need to figure out really what the timeline looks like for the metal shop.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha.
Nathaniel Seekins: Because it becomes much more palatable if it's spread across three businesses instead of just one business.
Jacob Greenberg: Absolutely. And if it ends up just being one business, we could revisit this conversation to make sure it works. We do want to support all of your businesses, though. Having more businesses as far as this project helps us, like, prioritize this and stick to that timeline of three months as opposed to prioritizing other projects that are on our backlog for integration. But yeah, off the cup, off the cusp. I know that definitely need to take some time to review, but how does that timeline and pricing sit with you? Initial instinct?
Nathaniel Seekins: So initially, you know, I feel like the timeline is. Is probably, well, fast enough. I mean, it's probably, you know, we're probably nowhere near three months to roll to customers on some of the stuff. Um, and As I said, you know, 30 is a pretty big nut to swallow for one business. If I can spread it across three, then I can probably get their other partners on board.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha.
Nathaniel Seekins: So that's kind of the, you know, the needle I need to thread now.
Jacob Greenberg: Right. It definitely seems like with the metal fabrication shop, that would be your biggest ROI. What for the boatyard is you'd be saving roughly $30,000 a year. Like 20, 24 to $30,000 a year. So understandably, that would be a little bit harder to navigate. It was just the boatyard with that price. I think if it's boatyard plus metal fabrication on my end, and I'm not in your shoes, but it seems like more of a no brainer in that instance. The other thing that I do want to propose here is to begin so that we can hold to your timeline. If four months makes more sense, we could have one month of you guys doing internal reviews and we could talk about this pricing and the rollout plan, maybe provide options for just boatyard versus metal fabrication, etc. But we can also offer just 15% of that cost up front and the rest paid off over time, if that's appealing to you guys. So what that would equal would be $4,500 to begin the project. Once that's paid, that 90 day timer starts to count down. And then after that for. We could spread it over the rest of the year or over 16 months if you'd like to, or 18 months. Excuse me. If we spread it out over the rest of the year, It'll be roughly 2400amonth, which is essentially the exact return on investment you would have for the boatyard. It was just for one location. We would essentially be building out a custom build that would be able to be implemented should you need to in the future for all of your other companies without an additional fee, it would be the same cost you're currently paying for the boatyard. It'd be a little bit more of an easier management system though, and a better customer branded experience. And if we do need to sweeten this deal in order to get it across, if it is just the boatyard and not the metal fabrication, we hit the drawing boards again and see what we can come up with.
Nathaniel Seekins: Gotcha. Okay. Those are all really good options to think about, Jacob.
Jacob Greenberg: Awesome. Okay, great. Let's see. I'd love to set a follow up here so that we can. I know you're on the road, so you're probably not able to take diligent notes on this, right?
Nathaniel Seekins: Now, no, that's for sure.
Jacob Greenberg: But what would be the next steps for you to evaluate this? I'm sure there's going to be something on your plate that's solo and then something about talking to some the partners and making that pitch. I want to be able to provide myself as a resource to help you make that pitch as efficiently as you can to the partners and other people involved. So what would be the next steps for you from here?
Nathaniel Seekins: So for me, I need to, I need to look at what we are currently really historically, what we've paid for ACH and credit card fees in each of those businesses so that I can calculate an internal ROI and then, and then just stick the numbers in a spreadsheet really based on the, you know, the payment spread that you've just talked about. The challenge I have with the boatyard, for example, and it's somewhat to the same degree at the bakery, is that they are, they're relatively seasonal, so we have large influxes of revenue. In the boatyard, it's spring and fall, in the bakery, it's middle of winter. The metal fab is pretty good in that it's, it's pretty steady year round. But again, we're under contract. So like until we actually, until the deal is signed, I hesitate to put too much into that.
Jacob Greenberg: Do you have a loose timeline on when you expect that deal to be either finalized?
Nathaniel Seekins: Yeah, I'm expecting that to close in January at this point, like mid January, ideally.
Jacob Greenberg: Gotcha.
Nathaniel Seekins: It was supposed for, for reference, it was supposed to close in July and then the seller had a heart attack followed by a heart transplant.
Jacob Greenberg: Oh my God.
Nathaniel Seekins: So we are, we're taking our slow time now with him. He wants to sell to us and we want to buy from him, but we're just where giving him some time and space.
Jacob Greenberg: Fair. That is fair. So how about this? If you do want to begin this integration build so that we can get it in the boatyard, we can probably have it ready. If we decide this month, what is it? October, November, December, January? If we decide to do it at the end of this month, we can have it prepared by the top of February so that when you close the metal fabrication, we could roll it out to there pretty instantaneously and start saving money right away. If it does come down to cost and numbers, I do understand that we'd be building it out for just one location. So the thing with that is we'd be able to potentially reduce the cost, but it might extend the timeline because we might prioritize other Integrations. Right, right. So it's a give take. It could be beneficial on the cost front. I know that you said the timeline for three months is very advantageous for you guys. So maybe you have some flexibility and it takes a little bit longer, but it reduces the cost and makes it more viable of an option. Should you just be moving forward with the boatyard? So that's definitely an option as well. Take some time to crunch some numbers. Let's set a follow up closer to the end of this month and we could discuss our options. Yeah, maybe we have a quick check in. Actually, I'm even thinking. And let me know what you think about this. Like a quick check in, in like a week, week and a half about where you're coming with the numbers so that I have some time to revisit with my team and see if there's any other levers that I can pull before the end of the month so that we could potentially be in a good place to make a decision. Top of next month, end of this month.
Nathaniel Seekins: That makes sense.
Jacob Greenberg: Yep. Cool. All right. So that is pretty much all I wanted to cover today. Do you have any other questions or concerns that you want to review before I set up a time for us to reconnect later this. This month?
Nathaniel Seekins: No, no, I'm good. This is. This is really helpful.
Jacob Greenberg: Fantastic. Okay, great. Let's set it up for, let's say, Monday the 20th. So that will give you one and a half weeks, maybe a little bit more.
Nathaniel Seekins: Yep. Okay.
Jacob Greenberg: All right. I'm just going to send out an invite now. Feel free to update the time should you want.
Nathaniel Seekins: I'll check my spam folder when I get home.
Jacob Greenberg: I hate that that happens. Okay, that's fair. All right. Okay, Nathaniel, I will talk to you on the 20th then.
Nathaniel Seekins: Cool. Thank you, Jacob.
Jacob Greenberg: Get home safe.
Nathaniel Seekins: All right, sounds good.
Jacob Greenberg: Talk to you later.
Nathaniel Seekins: Bye.
