angela: Good morning.
Christian Sheerer: Morning. How are you?
angela: Good. How are you doing?
Christian Sheerer: Doing well. Staying same old, staying busy. It's better than sitting around doing nothing. So I'm good. How are you?
angela: Doing well, thanks.
Christian Sheerer: Awesome. So I saw you guys linked up a payment method earlier today. How How did kind of playing around with it last week of?
angela: Okay, I did have a couple questions.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah.
angela: And then during the payment link up, my boss had a few additional concerns he wanted me to address as well.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, absolutely. Okay, so let's start with your questions and then we can go through those that remind me his name again.
angela: We haven't gone into that yet. He's our COO.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, what's his name?
angela: Adam.
Christian Sheerer: Adam, awesome. Okay. Just so I can refer to him.
angela: So let's see here. I did sync up QuickBooks.
Christian Sheerer: Okay.
angela: With it. Was wondering about it set up. I have an account in there called DMG Internal. And it seems to have set up two customers.
Christian Sheerer: Okay.
angela: For the same.
Christian Sheerer: Okay.
angela: So I wasn't sure why that happened.
Christian Sheerer: So it wouldn't have sent them anything. It just may have just pulled ones in that were linked to QuickBooks. What are you unsure of?
angela: Well, I have an account set up in QuickBooks called DMG Internal.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah.
angela: And now in NICOL, I have two accounts set up called DMG Internal.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, can you show me on your screen? Sure.
angela: Let's see. Yes, it's probably this one. Are you seeing that?
Christian Sheerer: It's starting now. Yeah, okay, cool. I see you.
angela: Yeah, this is an account we have. We have it set up for some bookkeeping purposes, but we also have it set up so we can do like a test invoice and so forth. I'm just not clear why it's set up to in nipple.
Christian Sheerer: I think that's because it's a separate email.
angela: I see the separate email.
Christian Sheerer: But.
angela: There'S only one that exists.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, it looks like one of them is pulling from QuickBooks, which is the one with the QuickBooks little icon next to it. And then the other one, did you add that as a new customer?
angela: Yes, you were right. I did before we had actually linked up QuickBooks. That's exactly what it was.
Christian Sheerer: Thank you. No, no, no, no worries. I mean, this is why we're here. So yeah, then also, No, it's a little, yeah, all these things are kind of funky at the first beginning of it. And that was when you emailed me and you're like, Hey, I want to set them up before I link the QuickBooks just to get through that flow. If I have to ever do it in a sense where they're not going to be in QuickBooks, right? Because sometimes that happens too. Sometimes people have customers that everything wants to eventually link up into QuickBooks, but they have some that are separated out in the beginning.
angela: Okay, and then so while we're along that line.
Christian Sheerer: Okay.
angela: We have several accounts in here, for instance, Buddy's Barbecue.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah.
angela: This is one. This is actually a sub account. When we have an agency set up, they are essentially the customer. And then Buddy's Barbecue is one of many sub customers. That we bill that agency for is, I mean, essentially if, for instance, if the agency went on here to pay the bill, would they have to go to each individual campaign they've got running each individual sub customer? Or is there a way for those to be classed in here appropriately?
Christian Sheerer: So they can pay them all at once, but essentially because Nickel is tracking each payment per one invoice, then it has to. It'll be a separate invoice. Right. If that's making. If that's. If that makes sense.
angela: Well, it should be a separate invoice. My concern is.
Christian Sheerer: You want. You want there to be one customer for agency. What's the agency's name? Just so I can refer to it.
angela: In a vision.
Christian Sheerer: In a vision. Okay, so for in a vision as one customer. And then you have separate invoices and maybe the name of the invoice is Buddies rather than invoice number two or whatever. It's invoice for Buddies for that time rolled up to the Innovision invoice or rolled up to the Innovision balance, I guess, the customer profile in Nickel.
angela: Yeah, my concern is when Innovision would go onto the portal to pay the bill, are they going to have to go into buddies barbecue to pay the bill and then go into every other campaign they've got to pay the bill, which I'm looking at could be a way. Oh, they paid buddies and they paid Zenith, but they overlooked their Hughies. You know, that's kind of where I'm running it. Because, for instance, in QuickBooks, when we import this stuff into QuickBooks, because we import all of our orders in the, the customer would be like, in a vision marketing group. And then there's a colon and then Buddy's barbecue. And then that directs it right to this sub account for Buddy's barbecue. When I import the order.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah.
angela: So then, and all of these have the same emails attached to them.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah.
angela: So I'm wondering, is there a way to reclass them here in nickel so that Because we deal with several agencies that have multiple campaigns running. So, I mean, this is just one example that we're going to run into. Yeah, I got you. I hear you.
Christian Sheerer: So can you, like, clear the search for, but I'm understanding. So Innovision has Buddies, Zenith, and Hueys. Did you guys pull in a Zenith already? Can, if you click that.
angela: Well, Zenith, I was pulling a different name out. They had, that's for a different one. They have Buddies. They have Hueys. They have, oh shoot, what else do they have? Come on, wake up. Unicorn jewelry. There's one. This would also be in a vision.
Christian Sheerer: I got you. Okay. Yeah, I'm understanding. So you would want to see all of so you'd want to see and then is there a customer for Innovision? Yeah. Can you show me that? Yeah. Awesome. Okay. And so those invoices aren't going to Innovision. They are right because the accounting at team Innovision is going to get the email, but it's coming up for buddies specifically, unicorn and then Huey's on the name side. Okay.
angela: Even though we have these sub customers in QuickBooks, it looks like during the sync, they brought them over as all individual customers instead of nesting them the way they have them in QuickBooks.
Christian Sheerer: I hear you. I think there's a way that we could build that. The immediate solution would be to They'd have those individually set out. So the ideal, just so I'm clear on your ideal relationship with Innovision, is you send them an invoice for Huey's plus Buddies plus Unicorn, for example, and that's add up to whatever 50.
angela: No, we send them individual invoices.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, yeah.
angela: For each one of those.
Christian Sheerer: Okay. And so that's what it's going to be doing currently, right? Because there'll be that individual invoice for those, but you just wanted to make sure that the customer is not a separate customer for buddies, for unicorn, for Huey's.
angela: No, my concern is, for instance, Innovision goes onto the portal to pay their invoices. Okay. What if they pay buddies and Hughies, but they forget to go down and pay unicorn if they have to go into each individual account instead of having, like, in a vision goes into their port, into our portal, and they see, okay, we've got invoices for buddies, Hughies, unicorn, and pay all of them. Do they have to go to each individual name or is there a way for those accounts or customers to be nested under Innovision like it is nested in QuickBooks? Because in QuickBooks, Innovision is the customer. Buddies is a sub customer. Unicorn is a sub customer.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, I'm hearing you. And so, okay. The way that it'll currently work, I'll show you an example on my end. A quick fix might be that or the initial fix. This is something that we would want to build out too. That nesting which is mapped accordingly into QuickBooks is here's the initial way. And I'll share once I have it pulled up. All right, so I'm in a vision, for example, and I get a bill from you guys. And I'll go in. Oh, it's not the one. I want it to be this one. I think it might just be a dead link. I'll send over a different one. And then I'll go into. Sorry, one sec. Mm-. I'll request this payment. Send the link to Christian. I'll go into my email. And so Christian, which in this case now I'm in a vision paying DeGraaf distribution or paying DMG, I can see all the other invoices that'll get paid out. This one might say for buddies and have the invoice specifically for buddies and then I can go in and pay the Hueys and then I can go in and pay the other ones. All the invoices will be able to link out from here, but it's going to be a one-to-one link, individual link up here per invoice payment.
angela: Okay, I'm not following what you just said there.
Christian Sheerer: So they're going to be able to see it all in one like sort of dashboard like this, but they'll have to individually pay out those invoices so that they don't mistake a buddy's payment for Huey's for unicorn jewelry. So for example, I'm here as in a vision paying out buddy's payment, And then if I see other unpaid invoices, the accounting@innovision will see all of the other invoices that got sent to me, which were due at some time. And so then they can come in for Huey's, which will pop up here, or Unicorn, which will pop up here, however many unpaid invoices there are. And they can click into that and then pay that out.
angela: Okay, so it's linked by email.
Christian Sheerer: Yes, exactly. The email of the customer that you're sending the invoice to. Yep. So, accounting or whatever@inavision.com.
angela: Okay. That shows me that. Okay, so let's see here. Can you show me or guide me on how I would an invoice that I've created in QuickBooks how I would export that over to Nickel or will that automatically happen overnight?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, it'll happen in real time. So it'll happen automatically within a couple seconds or minutes.
angela: It will. Even if it's a future dated.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, it won't do the past ones that have been reconciled because, you know, you've already reconciled them in QuickBooks, so those transactions that were happening outside of Nickel before us, right, it won't pull those past ones, it'll pull active, meaning needing to get paid, plus future ones.
angela: Okay, so this was something we discussed early on in this. That's a problem. We can't have invoices loaded on and queued for payment that are for future dates.
Christian Sheerer: It will pull them into Nickel for your visibility, but you don't have to send them until you need to send them.
angela: Okay, so will I be sending them from Nickel?
Christian Sheerer: Yes.
angela: Okay, so I'll no longer be actually sending invoices from QuickBooks.
Christian Sheerer: No, you'll upload them into QuickBooks. Create the invoice.
angela: Uh huh.
Christian Sheerer: And then you'll come into Nickel once it's been created here and send out the request.
angela: Okay. Invoices are sent from Nickel.
Christian Sheerer: That's how we make sure that we're. Not. Making customers, you know, pay the fees on the QuickBooks payment. The other way you could do it is it'll create that individual link in Nickel. You could go into Nickel, copy that link, and then paste it into your QuickBooks invoice and say, hey guys, in a vision, pay out via this link so that then they open the Nickel link. In their typical form when they get the QuickBooks invoice and then open the nickel link and pay it out. It's just one extra step that might be easier. I think the first way of doing it where you guys go in and send it out via nickel is probably the easiest because then it eliminates that extra step that they have to take. But there are editable, you know, those text fields in the QuickBooks invoice where you could say write a memo, write a note, etc. You could write in all caps, hey, pay out via this nickel link because it's better for you. If you're paying by card, it's better for us if we're accepting it by ACH, et cetera. And then they can pay it out that way. And then once that's paid, because the nickel invoice is linked up to QuickBooks by the customer level, once it's reconciled in QuickBooks or once it's paid out in either one, that back and forth sync is going to update automatically on both sides. So either way you want to do it, but I would suggest sending it coming in and just sending it through Nickel after it's been created in QuickBooks. Maybe you just have those two things set up in two different tabs so that you send it out through Nickel and that you don't have to give them the extra step of like, oh, do I open this other link in the QuickBooks invoice that I got? Is that? Clear.
angela: Okay, yeah. So I'll create the invoices in QuickBooks. They'll automatically load in Nickel, but they won't go to the client until I go into Nickel and say request payment.
Christian Sheerer: Correct.
angela: And I'm assuming I can customize that request payment message.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, absolutely.
angela: Can you show me what that looks like?
Christian Sheerer: I'm in this one, for example. I'm going to create or actually here I have customers from QuickBooks. I can't create a new customer because I already have this one, but I will create a new invoice for an existing customer from QuickBooks. And I'll say, you know, this is for Buddy's monthly or campaign. And I'll say whatever, the one time invoice date can set it for the future. Or. If this is already coming from QuickBooks, you'll have that invoice date or whatever due date that you set up in there. You can set up your note, okay, or Innovision for Buddy's campaign via DMG for XYZ date. And I'll create it, and then I can either send them that link then or I can schedule it for the future, but I'll send the link. That's me sending it to them. Now they're going to get a notification, and I sent it to my friend actually, but I can send one. To me. So I can do the same one. And. Maybe I don't want to send it to William. I'll send it to Christian. And I can send myself that link. And I'll give it a second. And so now I have these two different invoices that I sent out. Right.
angela: Gotcha.
Christian Sheerer: And then I'll go into, sorry, gonna just open it up in a different tab. And so I'll pay out this link. So Buddy's campaign to me. I'll pay by card, I'll pay by bank. But then I also see that other test that we had in those other unpaid invoices.
angela: Okay. So it's pulling it up. Okay. Gotcha.
Christian Sheerer: So this is for Buddy's campaign, right? That's how we make sure, to your question earlier, we want to make sure that paying for Buddies and for Unicorn and for Huey's. Right. So this is the link for that invoice for Buddies campaign, one to one link. So no mixing of the funds there. But I can still see on that page, oh, I have this, you know, test or this is for Huey's. Oh, I still got to pay that Huey's invoice. I'll click it up for another link. Now this is the link for the invoice for the Huey's campaign.
angela: Gotcha. So now, will it show where it says you have three other unpaid invoices? Would it show whatever other unpaid invoices were attached to those emails? Not the account name.
Christian Sheerer: Well, to the, if you have multiple emails for the account, then yes, because I, I guess, clarify your question. So you're saying.
angela: Okay, so, for instance, buddies and unicorn and Huey's all have the same email addresses in the customer profile.
Christian Sheerer: Yes.
angela: So when they're looking here and they click on, see unpaid invoices, will they see Huey's and unicorn and buddies? Because it's all based on their email?
Christian Sheerer: Yes, exactly.
angela: Okay. Gotcha.
Christian Sheerer: And then let's see here. And then if you ever, so what I was saying, which might make it a little bit more complicated, but to answer your question very simply, yes. But if I added another account to another email to my In a Vision customer contacts, maybe there's somebody in a different department that you need to send it to, or the accounting team responds to your invoice request and they're like actually send it to if you send it to Stacey this time, if you send it to Stacey that she'll be able to see the other ones too.
angela: Gotcha.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah.
angela: Okay. Can you, so if I'm going to generate the invoices in QuickBooks and send them to Nickel and then forward them onto the customers from Nickel, can you show me how those are generated in QuickBooks? Well, I know how to write them in QuickBooks. How I send them from QuickBooks to Nickel.
Christian Sheerer: You wouldn't need to, so if you're generating them in QuickBooks, it'll come up in Nickel because we've synced them.
angela: And then I just send them from Nickel. I don't need to send them to Nickel. They'll automatically populate, but they won't send them from QuickBooks. I send them.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, exactly. So like I sent that one. That we set up because we were ready to go. It came through and it's like, all right, cool, we're ready to go. We're gonna send it out. But no, they'll come in and then I can go in. So for example, I made one here or my friend made one actually, coworker of mine made one like a test here. This is a test coming in. I actually haven't requested it yet. Even though we made the due date prior, but I can just go in and request this payment.
angela: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: That came from QuickBooks. Hence the little symbol. And then I'll go in and request the payment. And then I'll just make sure, you know, who's getting that.
angela: Gotcha. Okay. Let's see here. And I think I answered this one on my own. If we do bill pay or if we pay a vendor invoice with a credit card through Nickel, that's also subject to the 2.99% fee, correct?
Christian Sheerer: 2.9 for AP, but correct. Yeah. So just a little bit different, but yes, if you're paying a bill via credit card, you'll see it come up. And so that one's cool too. So like if I'm same process, if a bill is coming in on QuickBooks, that'll sync over and hence why I have these QuickBooks generated bills. And I'll go in and make a payment. Well, I got my vendor here. I'll make this payment and I'll choose my payment method and then the delivery method. What have you?
angela: Gotcha. Okay. Let's see. On the 2.99% fee charged on the credit card payments, from customers. Is that the only fee charged and it's consistent? I mean, regardless if card is not present, if it's a debit card, if it's a rewards card, there are no additional fees, just the 2.99%, correct?
Christian Sheerer: That's correct. And you can customize it. The default logic is 2.99% to them. And I don't know if we had this conversation specifically because I have it all the time with people who sometimes have an agreement with their customers that they want to share it, for example. Or there's a special agreement with some customers that are larger, what have you, because of a negotiation happens and they say, Hey, we actually want to split. We want to pay by credit card, but we only want to pay 1.5% or 1.99 or whatever. You can split it with them if you want, but the default is to send it to 2.99% to them. You could also pay the entire 2.99% based on it, but you have that flexibility to go either which way or anywhere in between.
angela: Yeah, I realized that, but thank you for clarifying there. I was concerned that sometimes there are additional fees like If you're running a card payment and the card is not present, it's an additional charge. If you're running a card and it's actually a debit card, then there's a different charge. So I just wanted to ensure that the 2.99%, that's flat across all, even.
Christian Sheerer: If it's American Express.
angela: Debit, rewards, card not present, all that stuff.
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, it's always flat, 2.99%.
angela: Okay. If we are initiating the client credit card payment on their behalf, like we do a lot of times now, do we also have the option of setting that up as recurring, or would the customer be the only one that have that option?
Christian Sheerer: Well, they have to give us a debit authorization form, right? Meaning they have to go through the process of acknowledging, hey, okay, we're going to let our funds be pulled. But the answer, the very, the quick answer is yes, you have that option and you can set that up for them. And that's what's happening when it says, so let me flip around again and get into a, you know, another invoice and I'm going to set up a customer. One sec. That's what's happening when it says instead of send them a link, it says charge customer information on file. So when I go into this guy, I can go and I want to say get paid. I can charge the payment method on file. So I can add their customer payment method. Add their card. And if you have an authorization document that they've already agreed to, cool, throw that in there and save it. Or we can set up from the beginning, okay, I want to add a new customer, set up payment authorization. Oh, let me do 10. Set a payment authorization, request it or enter it, but I'm going to request it and I can set up different permission levels. So maybe you have an agreement with them that it's like you're never going to, you know, automatically authorize or automatically debit or pull from their information. Beyond a certain amount. So you can set up a transaction limit or you can set up no limit. You could set up an author expiration date with them. Maybe they give you authorization for a year's time or whatever it is. And then I'll send the request. This is to pull funds automatically or whatever, however you guys want to set that up. And I'll send the request to myself or my customer. Which is me in this case. And then I'll go in and I'll show you what that looks like, what they'll see on their end. So they'll get this email and they'll go in and they'll say, cool, DeGraaf Distribution or DMG wants to save your payment method on file. They'll go and complete the payment method form. They'll just get this basic security information, right, making sure They're all up to snuff. Those terms that you set up, so you said, hey, I'm going to, or we said together, hey, there's going to be a $25,000 transaction limit. So we can pull funds whenever basically we want up to 25,000. And we're going to have this authorization for a full year. And they read the agreement, they read the terms, all this fancy stuff. And then they go next step and then they can add their information so that you have it. And then they authorize it.
angela: Gotcha. Okay. Okay, just one last question for you, because I know we're probably going over time here.
Christian Sheerer: We set it up for the 15-minute mark, so it's up to you. Yeah, whenever you, this time is for you, so all good.
angela: So we're wanting to, if moving with this, we would not start initiating the payments through NICOL. We're going to continue running through Authorized.NET probably through the end of the calendar year. So I just wanted to confirm that NICOL would run alongside of Authorized.NET, not necessarily replace it. For the interim. Like right now, I guess they're considered our gateway and Chase Bank is our processor. So, Nickel would not be replacing that at this point, correct? It would just run alongside of it.
Christian Sheerer: Well, that's up to you. I guess, I mean, ultimately, we are replacing it. At the timeframe that you deem necessary. Right. So if you're sending invoices through Nickel and they're paying them out through Nickel, then they're going to pay them out through Nickel rather than by authorized.net. Right. Yeah. That's more of a question, I guess, for you guys. That's a question I would ask you is like, what is sort of the thinking there on having it run in tandem side by side. Is it you want to do a slower kind of, okay, over time, Nickel through the end of the calendar year will eat up more of those transactions and allow you to process them that way and you don't want to do a full switch over yet? Or is it you have a project planned to, you know, at the beginning of Q1 next year, switch them over into nickel. So I guess the same question that you just asked me, I would pose back to you.
angela: Gotcha. Okay. I wanted to make sure one wouldn't cancel out the other and wouldn't think it would. They're completely separate programs without any power over each other. But my boss was like, well, you.
Christian Sheerer: Know.
angela: Just make sure that it wouldn't, cancel it out. And I'm like, yeah, I don't think it works that way, but I'll confirm.
Christian Sheerer: But no, but I'm curious why, what's the, because I think part of the motivation to move over to Nickel is kind of save on those fees and the time that it takes to reconcile with authorized dinet and what they're charging on ACH and credit card. So is it more of an operational thing that you want to continue to use that or you guys paying them some certain amount of money per month that you're just like, contracted for to the end of the year, is it some situation like that? Walk me through the process of his thinking.
angela: Well, we have a lot of credit. The only thing that's run through authorized.net is credit cards. ACH payments are not run through there whatsoever. We have credit cards stored on there for a lot of clients that have said, please charge this card through the end of the year for my invoices. Well, once the card is saved on authorized.net, we can no longer see the card number. We can no longer pull that information back out. We can only see the last four digits. So we have a lot of them that we've already agreed to that through the end of the year. So we can't really go, oh, hey, now we're going to charge you a fee. And we want to give our clients, you know, a heads up ahead of time, so.
Christian Sheerer: I totally understand. I gotcha. So it seems more of like a, yeah, okay. So it's more of like an operational change that is going to require some education to the customer naturally. And that is, and it sounds like you guys are, you know, have a really organized situation already, right? Like when I was sort of spitballing like, Hey, maybe you guys have like an agreement with them through some certain amount of time and sounds like you do. Through the end of the year. Awesome. Okay, cool. And so what we do here is when you guys are all set up and running a couple of those ACH through Nickel. So it sounds like that would happen a little bit earlier, right? Is like those ACH ones that weren't going through authorized.net, that is your goal is to kind of get those invoices processed through Nickel. Sooner than the credit card that would have to be switched over at the end of those agreements?
angela: Possibly, yeah. I don't know if he's going to want to start like easing them in. I know there's going to be an advanced communication to our customers. I don't know if we're going to continue to.
Christian Sheerer: Just.
angela: Absorb all the fees through the end of the year and then let them know effective January 1. That, hey, you know, this, we're, you're now going to have to pay this fee, or if he's going to want to start generating invoices out of there immediately with the link about setting up payment methods and giving them advanced time to get that squared away, I just don't know what his exact, exact preference is going to be at this point.
Christian Sheerer: So. Got you. Heard you. Okay, so sounds like in my head, it's splitting up into two phases for us, right? It's like, those ACH ones, which would not be a change in fees, the ones that are generally paying through ACH, it's going to be a change in fee for you guys because now you don't have to pay that 1% on all of those ACH transactions.
angela: We don't pay for them now.
Christian Sheerer: You pay some fee on the ACH?
angela: No, we don't run it through QuickBooks.
Christian Sheerer: Oh, where's that?
angela: We do that independently. We just, clients who want to pay via ACH, they reach out, we give them the banking information to do it, which I don't like doing. Like sending our bank information into the ether.
Christian Sheerer: Exactly. So that's the change there. Yeah. So in, so in, in those ACH ones, rather than just like a fee that gets, you know, charged on that, it's like, hey, now Angela is going to be able to save time and peace of mind by sending it through nickel, because now we have this secure link that people are uploading their information into that. Angela, as digital marketing group, doesn't have to collect for them unless they want to give that authorization and vice versa doesn't have to open up that. Third and fourth line of communication in the case that they send over the ACH. Okay, so still those two phases, but with the benefit of saving that time and operational inefficiency with the ACH in the meantime on Nickel, and then that communication out to those credit card customers that are happening. And so what we do is we have three sorts of onboarding packages. One is happens within a week through our customer success manager. That's for kind of those urgent clients who are like, hey, I'm losing a lot of money on fees and I'm losing a lot of time and I really need to get Nickel set up pretty quickly. And as you did, Nickel, you know, you could set it up and start to get going technically pretty easily. But as it fits into your operational stuff, what I'm probably going to suggest is one of the second or third onboarding packages that we have. The second one being like, it's the same steps, but it's longer over the course of a month where you work with our customer success manager to kind of get this fully rolled out into your system. Or the third one is like over the course of a quarter where it's like, okay, we have certain benchmarks based on your guys' ideal target of getting everything rolled through one system connected to QuickBooks rather than authorize.net and then the external manual process for the ACH. And so it's sounding like to me it probably is going to be like one of those second or third ones, right? The month-long onboarding package where you guys have started to run some transactions through Nickel, but to make the most of it would require maybe about a couple weeks time or a couple months in the quarter-long package. Does that sound about right?
angela: Possibly. Tell me, This is the first time we've discussed onboarding packages. What's involved as far as additional fees, time limits on usability, and so forth?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, and no additional fee for it. This is because we're rolling it out and we're still in our phase as a company of trying to do best by our customers in the way that we can. So there's no extra fee for it. The reason that we split it up into different packages is so that we can protect our customer success managers time and that team's time and really kind of like differentiate based on the group that is coming in to start to use Nickel, which one would require like a more long thought out process. And because you guys have these, you know, clear operations already set up with how you interact with your clients, like, hey, you know, they've given us through the end of the year. This process to be able to check off their credit card through authorize.net and we want to switch that over at the beginning of quarter one. They'll set up time with you. Probably. Around four calls ish. It could happen a lot quicker if you need it to, to make sure that you're meeting your timeline on getting nickel to make, getting nickel rolled out to make the most of it. There's no additional fees. It's like, support is always going to be available whenever, but you'll have a customer success manager that you can set up time with on like a weekly cadence, if it's up to a month or about bi-weekly cadence up to that quarter long kind of period. Really, it's not for us, it's really to match your guys' timeline and what's most operationally efficient in terms of your goals in consideration with how you guys currently do things. So it's more about a process switch and we're making sure that we can prioritize how we communicate that process to you. And if there's anything that we need to do with, like, you know, part of it is he can set up a call with other people in the platform other than Angela that might be using it or help game plan a call with you. Like, how do we, you know, provide this proactive communication to our customers about how they're going to be able to use nickel with you as well?
angela: Gotcha. Okay. Yeah, I would probably look at like the bi-weekly quarterly, since we're getting really close to the fourth quarter, and we're wanting to have things rolling out by January 1, or at least effectively, you know, operating from there on January 1.
Christian Sheerer: So.
angela: Yeah, that sounds like a good plan.
Christian Sheerer: Awesome. Okay. So I think that's like the two phases I would communicate to him. Right. Is. And on my end. Then I think next steps for us would be to, those two phases being the first one wherein you're going to be able to save that back and forth time on the ACH stuff, make it that one quick link so that we're not yet replacing Authorized.NET, and then that second phase is like, okay, how do we replace Authorized.NET for AR and on the AP side running it as well as the ACH side running it through NiKkel. Those two phases being in coordination with each other, phase one being the ACH switch over, phase two being that authorized.net switch over with the communication to the clients on DMG's client side. Then the next step for us would be, sounds like we got the actual invoice customer situation cleared up in terms of what their visibility of it would be. You did a good job in between last time we spoke and now just getting familiar with the platform. You can run a couple of those transactions on the ACH side through us, and then we can set up time with his name's Colton with the customer success manager to sort of give you a first call with him to game plan out that quarter-long switch.
angela: Okay.
Christian Sheerer: Sounds good. And what I'll do in between then, so two sets of things. And the first one would be on your side, we can run some of those ACH transactions, see how they go. And then what I'll do is I'll communicate all the notes that I have about Digital Marketing Group and what you guys are looking at in terms of payments on both ends, AP and AR, in terms of your process, how the authorized.net stuff fits in, how the regular ACH stuff fits in, how QuickBooks fits in. And communicate that to him so that when we have that group call together, I'll sort of be more of like a fly on the wall, be able to answer any questions, but it'll be sort of a hand off into, okay, you've interacted with Christian as somebody who's like dealing with people interacting with Nickel for the first time. And then he is more focused on like, okay, the people who are familiar with Nickel have started to use it, right? You'll be in that group by then. How do we help them meet their timeline to make the most of it?
angela: Sounds great.
Christian Sheerer: Cool. I think we could set that up for next week's time if you think that gives you enough time to run some of these ACH ones.
angela: I'm going to be out of the office quite a bit and then I'm going to be jumping into the next round of invoicing. What about like the first week of October?
Christian Sheerer: First week of October?
angela: Yeah, yeah. Like I say, I'm going to be bouncing out of the office for most of next week. And then then I'll be coming back and starting on the next round of invoice calculations. So yeah, like the first week of October, like around the the second or third of October.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, cool. So it. So sounds like you'll have some transactions processed before then, probably on the ACH side, and then we can use that time because it's end of month. You guys usually do things end of month, right? Okay, awesome. And so, yeah, we can set up that time for them to review those ones that went out in September and got paid out as well as set up. And finalize the phase one plus game plan out with Colton and yourself what phase two looks like on the authorized.net switch.
angela: Perfect.
Christian Sheerer: Awesome. Let's do that. Does the same time usually work for you? I know that's just.
angela: Yeah, that's great.
Christian Sheerer: That was 2:30. You want to do 2:30 on the 2nd of October?
angela: Is that 2:30 Eastern?
Christian Sheerer: Yeah, same time as today.
angela: 11:30 my time. Yeah, either day, the second or the third.
Christian Sheerer: Let's do, yeah, let's do the second because then we'll give ourselves a buffer in the case we need to move it to Friday. And then also if you're, so as you're spinning it up on the ACH side and sending out those couple of transactions after you get back from being out of the office, If there's anything that you need, like we can set up a quick another 30 minutes or 15 or longer between me and myself or sorry, myself and you to troubleshoot those. And then by that time we'll probably have a majority of the initial setup kind of a lot of the onboarding you've already done, to be frank. But this is just about game planning, like you already know the system. How do we roll it out writ large? But yeah, in between now and then, if you're running those invoices, I'll stay in contact with you and I'll always be in contact. You can always hit me back up. But then, yeah, we can schedule something if something comes up in between now and October 2nd.
angela: Sounds good.
Christian Sheerer: Cool. Awesome. Well, you've been a great partner and I think you'll continue to be one so far. So yeah, continue to rely on me if you have any random questions that come up, like weird troubleshooting things that you ran into. And I'll be proactive as well, just like making sure as we see stuff come in, making sure everything went smoothly.
angela: Perfect. Thanks so much, Christian.
Christian Sheerer: Okay, Angela, you have a good one and I'll see you soon. And I'll send a recap about all of this and I'll introduce you to Colton over email as well, so you have both of our contacts. And if anything ever comes up, support is always available and I'll be available too and we can schedule some time if we need to on an ad hoc basis.
angela: Good deal. Thanks again.
Christian Sheerer: All right, you have fun out of office wherever you're going.
angela: Will do.
Christian Sheerer: All right, see ya.
angela: Take care.
Christian Sheerer: Bye bye.
