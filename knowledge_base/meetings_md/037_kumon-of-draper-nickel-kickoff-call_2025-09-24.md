Colton O'Farrell: Good morning. Hi.
Adam Wray: Oh, good morning. Hi.
Colton O'Farrell: How is your day going so far?
Adam Wray: Oh, pretty good. How about you?
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, can't complain here. Made it to the midpoint of the week, so. Beautiful day here in Chicago. You're calling from Utah, it looks like.
Adam Wray: Yeah, Yeah. I used to live in Michigan, though, so not too far away.
Colton O'Farrell: Oh, very cool. Awesome.
Adam Wray: Yeah, we only lived there for like four years and we didn't make it to Chicago because. Well, actually we had like a trip planned in Chicago, but that's when Covid happened and so, oh, so much everything got shut down, so we never made it there.
Colton O'Farrell: Right. No, it's actually crazy today. Today is my one year of living here, so I moved originally from Minneapolis, but.
Adam Wray: Oh, nice.
Colton O'Farrell: Really loving in here. Great place. So how was life in Utah?
Adam Wray: Oh, it's great. We love Utah. As gloomy as Michigan. Michigan.
Colton O'Farrell: So beautiful in Utah. I've been a couple. Went to Arches national Park. Have a lot of good friends in the Salt Lake city area. Have not been, unfortunately yet, but it's on my list to go to.
Adam Wray: So yeah, you need to make it here. It's pretty great.
Colton O'Farrell: Awesome. Well, Heidi, thanks again so much for making time with us today. Really just to do a little introduction and kind of the goals of this call. So. My name is Colton. I work on the customer success team here at nickel. You can think of me as your strategic partner, really, to understand your business objectives and help you to achieve them. With nickel, that's really my entire role. So I'm going to start helping you with onboarding. With training, we'll select one of three onboarding plans that are included for free. It's just more so along the timelines of when you'd like to get started and have a go live. So we have a quick one week. If you'd like to get started right away. If you want a little bit more time and kind of play around with the solution, we also have a one month onboarding or a one quarter or three month onboarding. Do you have any kind of specific requirements kind of from a timeline perspective?
Adam Wray: Yeah, I'd like it to be sooner. So let's see. One week. Okay, let's see. Yeah, one week would be. What is the date today?
Colton O'Farrell: It is the 24th.
Adam Wray: 24Th. Okay. Yeah, one week would be great. So just to kind of give you some background, we are taking over a business. So we're. It's called kumon. It's like a learning center.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep.
Adam Wray: And so we officially everything gets transferred to us on October 1st.
Colton O'Farrell: Okay.
Adam Wray: So. And that's when, like the current. The current owner right now, that's when she charges. She charges on October 1st. Like it's just recurring for everyone.
Colton O'Farrell: Okay. On those reverse static amounts generally, or they dynamic and change, depending, they're pretty static.
Adam Wray: So it's. Well, whoever's in there, that's what they'll pay. And if it changes, it's just because they've added another subject. So I guess it can change, but it's pretty consistent.
Colton O'Farrell: Okay.
Adam Wray: Yeah. And so my goal is that I want. It would be great if we charged on the 1st of October, but then I want to change them all to the 28th because I need that wiggle room to make sure, like, everything's gone through.
Colton O'Farrell: To make sure you want the payments to land in your account by the first, is what you're saying.
Adam Wray: I don't even. Well, yeah, maybe if they could like.
Colton O'Farrell: You want them to be like, scheduled in advance on the 28th, but to land count on the 1st with that widget.
Adam Wray: Yeah. Gives me that wiggle room. So if people aren't paying, I can make sure they like if for some reason it got declined. Yeah, I can see it.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Nope, that makes perfect sense. We absolutely can support that. I'm not sure. So I have a couple of questions. One, just curious, how did you find nickel? Was it referral? Were you just doing some Google searching?
Adam Wray: Kind of, yeah. ChatGPT. And so I just kind of started looking. They gave me a few options. And so I'm looking because I'm like, I'm just starting my business and it's not. But it's like that's how I want to be paid for sure. Because it's not like people are buying a product. Right. It's just a service. But I'm also like, trying to be smart with money because I just. I don't even. Honestly, right now I'm like, I don't know what money is coming in and just trying to see. But just. So. Yeah, so this kind of sounded like a good option for now.
Colton O'Farrell: What. What insight has the previous owners shared with you from, like, it sounds like you're mostly be using nickel from an accounts receivable perspective. Do you also imagine paying any bills through nickel on the accounts payable side?
Adam Wray: Okay, well, I could do that, actually. I pay franchise fees, but they just pull that straight out of my account. So that wouldn't be a thing. But it would just be like, maybe like our monthly bills. Like, it could be just like our heating and electric. I'm trying to think what else we would. Oh, I mean, I could probably. Well, I don't know. I mean, I guess like possibly pay rent through. I don't know because I don't know how I'm gonna pay that yet. But there are possibilities that I could.
Colton O'Farrell: Oh yeah, just helpful for us to know. So you do have full. Like you can use both the accounts receivable.
Adam Wray: Both.
Colton O'Farrell: And the accounts payable. Some people only use one or the other. It really is dependent on your business, but you do have the full capability to do so.
Adam Wray: May I ask you a question? If I use it. If I use it for, say I just like. Because I would set it up the same way, right. Like this is what I want you to pay my rent. So you would just pull it and pay my rent for me. Is that like pull up from my account?
Colton O'Farrell: Yep. So we have, we have two plans available. So right now you're currently set up on the nickel core plan, which is the completely free plan. There are some limitations with that plan. It's more.
Adam Wray: So I actually signed up for the second one.
Colton O'Farrell: Oh, did you sign up Plus?
Adam Wray: Yeah, it's just like it just says, it's a 14 day free trial.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep. Let me see if I. Oh, okay. Apologies. I missed this. Yes. With. With the plus. The main thing I was going to say is with the, the nickel core is you don't have a lot of the functionality of what you're looking to do that is within the plus. But, but if you're signed up with the nickel plus. Yeah, absolutely can do. So there's kind of two different options with the. On the accounts receivable side for paying of invoices. One, you can either set up recurring invoices to go out to your customers that they will have those invoices on. Either you can set it up to be weekly, monthly, quarterly. It's. You really have a lot of flexibility and how you want those set up. Sounds like it's going to be monthly on the 28th. If it's a static amount, setting up those recurring payment invoices to your customers, that will work great. However, if the amounts change and are more dynamic, we have something called debit authorization that would be better suited for you. And what that allows for is you would send a payment authorization request to your customer. You can either set it with limits in a time frame or you can set it with no limits and no timeframe. Most people like to have something in there, but you could say like, as long as the invoice is what's. What's kind of a general invoice on a monthly basis for some of these customers.
Adam Wray: Well, if they're paying per student. Well, it's interesting. Right now it's about 150 per subject. And we. And each student can have two subjects. I would say most have one, but then there's families that have multiple kids. Right, right. So I'm charging more starting, starting in October. I'm going to keep all of them where they're at, but like new people coming in.
Colton O'Farrell: It's about grandfathered in for like the, the existing. Yeah, gotcha.
Adam Wray: Yeah, so I'm gonna.
Colton O'Farrell: Oh, I was gonna say just with the debit authorization, basically you could set it with like parameters so that you could have it. So as long as the Invoice is under 500, a thousand dollars, whatever rate you want to set it as, you would just automatically be able to pull from your customer's account and, and pay for that invoice. They would have said it, they would have given you permission for it and they would have said how they want to pay it. So the great thing with nickel is if you are paying via ach or being paid via ach, there are no fees ever for you or your customers that is always a hundred percent free with nickel. If they want to commit the credit card, they do have that option as well. However, on accounts receivable, they will be the ones responsible for paying the 2.99% credit card surcharge.
Adam Wray: We believe you charge the customer.
Colton O'Farrell: We charge for credit cards on accounts receivable and by default it automatically 100% is to be paid for by the customer. But you do have, you do have full control. So you can go in there and split it 50, 50. At a global level, you could split it at any percentage you'd like. You could fully eat the cost. You could also just keep the global rule set. So the customer, if they want to pay with the credit card, they're going to cover that fee. But maybe for one family or for one of your customers, you'll split it or you have some kind of unique agreement. You can go and override the global rules on an individual customer or invoice level as well.
Adam Wray: Okay. Yeah. Interesting, because I, I mean, that makes me think that's. I kind of like that you charge that. What I was doing here, I was just doing a rate. If they wanted to do credit cards, I was just charging it in. Yeah. So if I build it in like that, I could go in and say, charge me the credit card fee.
Colton O'Farrell: Like I could go in, let's Actually, just go ahead. Are you able to get logged into your account and share your screen? We can go ahead. I know we still have a little bit of setup to do, but I can kind of just show you.
Adam Wray: Tell me how to share my screen.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah. So there's a green button at the bottom that says share. And so you'll just click that and want to share the. The nickel platform window. I'm not sure if you have multiple monitor on the one, but yeah, I.
Adam Wray: Just have the one. So if I share. Okay, share this time. Okay. Can you see my screen yet?
Colton O'Farrell: Not yet. You want to try pushing that button again?
Adam Wray: Yeah, I think I had. Oh, so is it for my desktop? Is that maybe I need it?
Colton O'Farrell: Yep. So what I. What I usually do is I'll hit the share button and then I'll just hit the. The desktop. It sounds like you one desktop. So it'd be desktop one in your. Your case.
Adam Wray: Right. Okay. I think I have to grab.
Colton O'Farrell: Probably grant some permissions to zoom maybe.
Adam Wray: Yeah, let me. Okay, let's see if. If not, I might have to. Let's see if it will share it. Oh, is it sharing it? Hold on.
Colton O'Farrell: But I can also drive to. Oh, now it's.
Adam Wray: Okay. There you go. Okay, so let me go into. Okay, can I get nickel or something? There we go.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep, that works. Okay, hit the login button. Or I can annotate as well. There you go. Perfect. All logged in. Awesome. So if you hit the. The get paid section. So this is accounts receivable. This is going to be more the most relevant to you. So we're going to want to go ahead and hit the setup payments button there.
Adam Wray: Okay.
Colton O'Farrell: So what this top one is is this is a merchant payment portal.
Adam Wray: So.
Colton O'Farrell: So in addition, are. Are you operating on QuickBooks online today or.
Adam Wray: I'm not. Yeah.
Colton O'Farrell: You have anything for accounting systems or is it more so kind of spreadsheets? What are you operating from in that perspective for accounting?
Adam Wray: Well, so I don't really have anything yet, honestly, like. Cause I.
Colton O'Farrell: That's fine if you don't.
Adam Wray: I hired it like I hired a payroll and so I was just gonna like so quickbook, would that be like. If I'm doing quickbooks, would it be like my kind of show what like my monthly expenses in and out are. Because I was just going to do an Excel worksheet, but do I do.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, you can. You can absolutely just use Excel if you'd like. I was going to say if you do have QuickBooks online, we just. We have a native integration so what that means is once you sync it, we'll automatically pull in all your customers, all of your invoices. We can set up automation so that once it's created in QuickBooks, we just automatically send your customers. If you don't have that, I mean you can use Nickel as like a complete solution itself, which it sounds like would be relevant in your case. What I would say then for this top one, what it is is when you're sending an invoice to your like the parents for their students courses that they're taking, like you can send individual invoices to the parents. However, we'll also give you access to your own payment portal. And this will serve as kind of a one stop shop for anyone to come in and make a payment. And it won't be tied to a specific invoice, but a parent could come in and say I'm going to pay $160 for a science class. Here's my the student's name. Or if you have an invoice number and they can just come in and make any kind of payment, it more so serves as like a backup method. Most of our customers will take this and embed it in their website just to give like if a parent's not able to figure out like completing it on the actual invoice, they can still come into the portal and complete that payment.
Adam Wray: So.
Colton O'Farrell: So you don't have to get stuck with getting a check, for example.
Adam Wray: Right. Okay, so my question for you is like when I send the invoice, do they have to accept it first?
Colton O'Farrell: And I'll show you what I was like. Yeah, the main thing I would say so with this, it looks like Kumon of Draper. That sounds like most of what you would like your URL to be for the payment portal just because it is a franchise. Cool. So I guess the main thing on this page is do you have a company square logo that you could upload into at the bottom tab there?
Adam Wray: Probably, yeah.
Colton O'Farrell: Let's say if you have that, that'd be awesome to add now. And then we'll just hit the complete setup and we'll have access to the rest of the tools. And I'm also going to send you a test payment from my demo account just so I can show you kind of what that, what that looks like or what your customers would see on their end.
Adam Wray: Okay, let me see if I can. I swear she told me yesterday where.
Colton O'Farrell: If you don't we can always add it later as well.
Adam Wray: Let's add it later because I'M like, I don't know.
Colton O'Farrell: Let's hit the complete setup button then at the bottom.
Adam Wray: Okay, sorry. I'm just making myself a note to do that because I can come back. I can come back in and do that, right?
Colton O'Farrell: Yep. You can come into Account Settings and change those at any, any time.
Adam Wray: And so If I do QuickBooks, like, even just for, like, my accounting purposes or whatever, I can just connect them and then you'll just throw in, like, what I paid out and what I've received.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep. So we will. We will grab the invoices from QuickBooks, we'll bring them over to Nickel, including the attachment, so that invoice that's generated within QuickBooks, we automatically bring it over, we send it to your customers to pay. And the real value in doing that is so that you don't. QuickBooks charges a 1% ACH fee on transactions. So if you do that via nickel, you're not going to experience that, but you'll still get the functionality and things that you think QuickBooks and so smart.
Adam Wray: Because then if you're just doing everything with your business, you just see where your money's going and coming. Okay, awesome.
Colton O'Farrell: Exactly. So what I'm going to do here is I'm going to go ahead and just create you as a pretend customer on my end so that we can. So you can see what it would look like for your customers when you're setting them up. So what I'm going to do.
Adam Wray: So I have a question for you. They just. I give them a sheet of paper and they just fill it out. So I go in and just put it all in for them.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep. All we need from your customer is their email address, the customer name and their email address.
Adam Wray: Okay.
Colton O'Farrell: So here's. And I can.
Adam Wray: Actually.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah. If you want to stop sharing for just a moment, I'm going to share my screen so I can just show you what I'm doing. Because you'll be doing a lot of this. You can hit the. There should be a Stop Share button. Maybe if I click in, I might be able to. Okay, here, I think I can get you.
Adam Wray: Do. I just.
Colton O'Farrell: I think I got it. Can you see my screen?
Adam Wray: Oh, let me see. Sorry.
Colton O'Farrell: Do you see the screen here where it says create a customer?
Adam Wray: No, I don't.
Colton O'Farrell: Let me try that again.
Adam Wray: Okay. Yeah.
Colton O'Farrell: Now you see it.
Adam Wray: Yeah.
Colton O'Farrell: Cool. So what I'm doing, what I did is I went to get paid customers, clicked new customers, just typed in your name, your email. What I was mentioning before with the payment authorization is right Here. So this is if you have dynamic amounts that you just want to automatically be able to pull and charge from your customers, you would set it up as you're setting up the customer so you'd have their name. You'd click set up payment authorization. There's two options. It's full permissions, which means that there's no limit to what you can charge them. It does not expire. Most people are generally not okay with that. But so most people, what they do is they do the limited permission. So you can come in here and this will be the amount that you're able to pull from on up individual invoice level. So for your rate might be $1,000 or $5,000 max transact per transaction. You could have it expire. So we generally just push it out a year. But you can also turn it on so that it doesn't expire at all. But you would just send that quick message here. And we have some frequently asked questions letting them know that this is an authorization for Kumon of Draper to automatically pull from your account. Nickel is the payment processor. We're sock to compliant. We're protecting all their information, your information as well. This authorization can be revoked at any time and they can pay for it either with their bank for free, with ach, no fees, or the credit card. I'm not going to set you up as a. I'm just going to go ahead and will not do the payment authorization. I will just set you up with a. Oops. Oh, it did. It did grab you. Cool. All right, so I do have you in here. I'm going to do new invoice. Oh, wait, sorry, I'm in the wrong section. Invoice here. Awesome.
Adam Wray: So this is, this is what I would be doing. Is what you're doing a new invoice?
Colton O'Farrell: Yep. So I created you as a customer. I clicked that set up payment authorization initially, but I exited out of it because I'm just going to send you a direct invoice so you can see what it looks like in case you're not doing the payment authorization. But I'm going to set it up so it's recurring so you can see what that would look like. So as Nickel plus Member, you also have some advanced features here. So if you wanted to disable credit card payments altogether, you could do that. If you want to allow the customer to make a partial payment, can turn that on. And this is one example of where you can override the global settings. So at this bottom one, if a customer wants to pay with A credit card right now they're going to pay the 2.99% fee themselves. But if you want to go ahead and override this, you can change it at any percentage you'd like. It just needs. Okay, equal 100 basically. But I'll just the default. So that's all saved there. Invoice name you're generally calling these. Is this like tuition for you? What do you call the. The.
Adam Wray: Yeah, I would say tuition.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, tuition. Awesome. I'll just do child's tuition. We'll say that they're doing like two classes with us and we'll set this up to be recurring every month. We want it to. It's only. So you know, as a financial institution, we're only moving money Monday through Fridays. If it is after 4pm Eastern time, it rolls over to the next day. So that's to keep in mind when you're scheduling these. I'm just going to schedule it here for the 26 and that's going to end again. We'll have it end on the 26th of the next year. So you can see when those invoices, what dates they would go. And I'll just say hello, please make the payment as soon as possible. And I'll also put just demo here so we remember that. And if you have any attachments, you can also just drag and add those to the invoice itself. Like so I'm just going to attach like a simple template from the Internet so you can see that you can just simply attach those. It will show up. Well, I'm creating that. We're going to send that to your email. So we have this secure payment link right here. This is going to be sent to your email. I'm sending it now, should get it in just a moment. But while you're waiting to get that, this is what you're going to see once you click the Pay now button so your customer would see your name, email, your branded logo, the invoice name invoice attached there. And then this is the two options for payment. So they can either pay with their bank via ach, no fees there or if they want to pay with a credit card, they can do that. They're just going to cover that fee. You are going to get the net amount, so you'll get the $300 nickel will handle all the PCI compliance and we'll get the $8 and 97 cents is our fee essentially.
Adam Wray: Okay, so this is if they were to, if I was to send that invoice and they would Click to pay it.
Colton O'Farrell: Yes. Did you get the email?
Adam Wray: Yeah. Let me look.
Colton O'Farrell: It'll be from the GR distribution is my demo account.
Adam Wray: Yeah. Let me. Okay. Yeah, so it has the pay now. So how do we have it where they're just already mad automatically charged where they.
Colton O'Farrell: So that's where we would do that debit authorization. So I'm pretty sure I have a example of what it looks like.
Adam Wray: Do you have to do it this way first for the first payment or you can automatically start.
Colton O'Farrell: You can automatically set it up with the debit authorization if you want to.
Adam Wray: Yeah.
Colton O'Farrell: Have a. Let's see. So here is a. This is a vendor set up payment authorization right here. So they want. It would say Kumana Draper wants to save your payment method on file max trans transaction amount when it expires. So what is the payment method request for? How does nickel protect my information? So just these frequently asked questions with answers this. Hopefully this link is still active. Cool. So if that was too long in the first page and they didn't read it, we do have all those frequently asked questions and answers again here for them. But they would simply go to get started. They would click that they agree to these and they would go to the next step and they would add how they would pay for that. So if they want to set up debit authorization with their bank, we just automatically pull from their account. They will have to verify with plaid. We do that for all debit authorization accounts just the first time when they're setting it up and getting it connected. But once it's set up they would. You would just automatically pull from their account unless they revoke that authorization in the future. So I sent you. So this is the. The paint debit authorization and then what I sent you was the. In like a recurring invoice. So the recurring invoice works great if you want to just send them for the static amounts. And then the debit authorization is best for if they're a recurring payment. But it's more dynamic values because you can charge at any rate as long as it falls within the parameters of that max transact transaction rate.
Adam Wray: Right. Okay, so just walk me through like the very first time they do it because like right now they're all just getting char like she's just billing them for the month. Right. And so I was just going to take their information, plug it in and charge them. But do they need to go in their email and accept it first?
Colton O'Farrell: So what do you guys, what do you have today? Do you have like payment authorization forms completed already?
Adam Wray: They have, yeah, she has them all. I'm going in later today. But yeah, she has all the forms with like their numbers, their signatures.
Colton O'Farrell: So we, we can honor those. What I will say though is getting debit authorization through nickel is going to be better or like nickel just because we, you know, as a financial institution, we do have to meet like bank. The bank secrecy act, there's like know your customer laws, anti money laundering regulations. Unfortunately, there's lots of examples of people that will try to commit fraud in very creative ways. And so the only way that we, we can know for certain is, you know, if it goes through nickel because we obviously that's something that we've built. We can honor those that you have that exist today. But they might, they might slow down payments because the team, our compliance and regulatory team would just have to review all those to make sure that they're valid.
Adam Wray: Right.
Colton O'Farrell: And just like somebody wasn't using like AI and made a, you know, made like a picture that looked legitimate. Unfortunately, that's the world we live in now. So.
Adam Wray: No, I know that that makes sense. I'm just trying to think, I'm like, oh, because our parents don't even all come in every. If that makes sense.
Colton O'Farrell: Right.
Adam Wray: Like they have certain days.
Colton O'Farrell: So I'll talk with the team for the, the best example. So if you already have that information on file like you can. That. It's more so from a. That it works best on a vendor side. In terms of accounts receivable. We do still need some kind of authorization. If they've given it, we can support it. But with the time of you wanting to have those scheduled on the 28th and land in your account on the 1st, I would say let's. We can get all the customers added, but then we'll transition to the, the debit authorization probably would work best for you.
Adam Wray: Okay. So if I do. See like if parents do. If the, if I can catch the parents that come in today, should I just like have computer ready?
Colton O'Farrell: Yes.
Adam Wray: And then they can like. So I would just go in, add their account. They can put all their information in.
Colton O'Farrell: Here's exactly what I guess.
Adam Wray: Okay.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, you'd go to customers.
Adam Wray: Okay.
Colton O'Farrell: You'd go to new customer here. You would add their name, email, and then you would click the setup payment authorization button.
Adam Wray: Okay. Set up authorization. Okay.
Colton O'Farrell: So like here's an example. I'm just adding pretend vendor myself, enter my name, email, and then once you do that, you would just click that payment authorization and you would set it here. So once you've Clicked that. We've already added them as a customer. Now the next step is the payment authorization. So you would like.
Adam Wray: And they'll get emailed, right? Oh, so that I put that.
Colton O'Farrell: So you putting this information here. So maybe you have just a something you're copying and pasting each time into here. That's what kind of explanation you have for this. You could also turn off the expiration date if you don't want there to be an expiration date. But you put that amount in there. Once you hit send request your customer, they will get an email that looks like this and if you have it pulled up there with them, you can just explain and kind of walk, walk them through it. But again, we do have these frequently asked questions with answers as well as all of our security and payment data protection information here. Okay, yeah, I'm happy to share these resources for you as well. Just have on hand. But we are SOC2 compliant, so we're audited quarterly. We meet all of the strict requirements. We basically have the same level of security and protection as a bank would have. We do all the PCI compliance and then again we're protecting everything with encryption and tokenization. So that's the recurring that I showed you. You also, once you get your payment portal set up so you would go into account settings, you would add your branded logo there. Once that's done, you can also add a banner. When that's added, you'll go to this get paid tab here and there's this purple payments portal link. This is that one stop shop where anybody can come in and make a payment. It's not tied to direct invoice, but this could be like your backup method. A lot of our customers will take it and they'll just embed this link into their website. So you could just come in here. Parent can make any kind of payment they want. They pay by card, pay by. And this could maybe serve as a backup method. You potentially might not use it so much. Some of our customers use it a lot. Just kind of depends. That's where you're.
Adam Wray: Well, I could see, I could see if like it's weird. People are like, oh, that credit card doesn't work anymore, whatever. So then I'm like, well come and pay right now. Like they could pay there and then we could set up something later. Okay, so yeah, what. So if I need to go in, I need to go to my account settings and get paid and do I need to enter all my like information like my bank account or.
Colton O'Farrell: So you just need to do all that one time, I believe you still need. So you'd go into account settings and there's paid. So this is on the accounts receivable. I believe we'll need to add a bank account for accounts receivable.
Adam Wray: Okay.
Colton O'Farrell: You've added it for the bill pay, I believe. But yeah, then if you'd like to pay bills with nickel, there's no fees on the ACH. There is a 2.90% if you pay bills with nickel.
Adam Wray: Okay.
Colton O'Farrell: But if you pay with your bank account, again no fees there, but you would just add. So this is the AP side, this is the AR side and this is also where you're going to find the global rule for the surcharge rate. So this by default, it's set up at 100%. You can override this to be any percent that you'd like. If you wanted to fully eat the costs, you would just, you would pay the full amount there. Your customers wouldn't have a fee. But again you can go into an individual customer level. So we'll keep the global rate at 100. And then for this one, for example, you can come in here and we'll say we're splitting the fee 50, 50 with them if you wanted to.
Adam Wray: Okay. Okay. I think, I mean it probably would be good if I just maybe got all of their emails, like their names and emails set in the system and put like their how much they need to pay and just have them go authorize it the first time. Is that what you're.
Colton O'Farrell: That, that could absolutely. Yeah, that could absolutely work as well.
Adam Wray: And if I didn't like, if I did just put their invoices in or like that, you know, with what I have, how would I put that in?
Colton O'Farrell: Yes. So this is a great call out. Great call out as well. So you can always reach out to me. Like I mentioned, I am in meetings a lot of the time in the day. So if you're looking for the fastest response possible, you'll find within the help center here. So you click the help center, you can send our team a message directly. So you just click message. This will go to our customer success team, our engineers, our support team will generally reply within about eight minutes. If you have like a CSV file where that information is living today, you can provide that to our team via like this message feature here. And they will get it loaded into the account for you. They just need to make mapping.
Adam Wray: So I don't, I don't manually put it in you. I would need to send you, you.
Colton O'Farrell: Have a If you have a CSV file, we can absolutely set up the account for you and get that information uploaded. But moving forward, once it's added, you would just go into the invoice section here. You'd click invoice, you'd click new invoice. You'd set it up to be recurring. If it's recurring and you have the debit authorization, we just automatically pull from the account. But if we can, we can get the accounts and everything uploaded for you if needed.
Adam Wray: Right.
Colton O'Farrell: I know we're, we're running up here on time, so I wanted to make sure we get that next meeting schedule. Heidi, what is a. So it sounds like after we get off the call, you'll be spending some time getting everything set up.
Adam Wray: Sounds like I'll be there later. Yeah.
Colton O'Farrell: A week will be a good amount of time to resync on transactions and just review what you've already done.
Adam Wray: Right. That would be good. But just really quickly. Sorry, I'm so confused. Like, since I have their papers with like their account information and when they're like supposed to pay, like is there any way to, like I have to, like, I don't have this CVS file. We only have them on papers, you know what I mean? Like we only have them on.
Colton O'Farrell: Let me touch base with the team to understand the best way to get that information from you.
Adam Wray: Right.
Colton O'Farrell: But I'll follow up in an email.
Adam Wray: Okay.
Colton O'Farrell: Shortly. And I'll also provide kind of like a checklist of some next steps to do. But let's go ahead and get that meeting scheduled just because my calendar can fill up a little quickly here. So we'll be meeting on October 1st.
Adam Wray: Okay.
Colton O'Farrell: Or would you like to do a day before?
Adam Wray: Oh yeah, actually maybe a day before just because.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, of course.
Adam Wray: Everything. Yeah, that first is going to be kind of busy.
Colton O'Farrell: Right. And let's see. So how does the same time on the first work for you? So there's a. It would be 10 o' clock mountain time.
Adam Wray: Could we do 11? Do you have an 11, 11 o'? Clock?
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, I do. So I will set that for 11 o', clock, be a 30 minute meeting to review transactions. Also, I didn't really get a chance to touch on this. Heidi, quick, but just for forecasting perspectives, do you have an understanding of what volume that you'll be receiving from an accounts receivable side from these parents? I know obviously a little bit of change of ownership in the business.
Adam Wray: Yeah.
Colton O'Farrell: Just curious if you have an idea from an AR and AP standpoint of funds that you Plan to. To transact through nickel. Just helpful.
Adam Wray: I mean, gosh, I don't know. The goal would be. I don't know what she's at right now. It could be like 12,000amonth right now. But like by the end of the year I'd like to be up back.
Colton O'Farrell: Up to like 21.21,000 on accounts receivable for like.
Adam Wray: Yeah, for the month.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah. And then on the bill, the accounts payable side. So you kind of mentioned like some rent, utilities, but maybe. Yeah, a couple. What would you at?
Adam Wray: I don't know. I would say, I don't know, maybe 5,000.
Colton O'Farrell: Okay, perfect. Just helpful information for us to know as we're forecasting kind of expected volumes, but. Awesome. I am sending that invite here now if you want to just let me know if you receive that. Any other questions though before I hop off here? I like I said, I'm going to get you answers. Kind of the best way to move forward with getting your account and everything set up. Send a checklist and some additional resources for you. But anything else that you have for kind of outstanding questions.
Adam Wray: No, no questions. I didn't get that email though.
Colton O'Farrell: Maybe it's for the next. The next meeting, the next Zoom.
Adam Wray: Yeah, let me see.
Colton O'Farrell: Why is it. Okay, here we go. Should come through now. Yeah, it was weird. I'm not sure why I did not go through that first time, but let's see.
