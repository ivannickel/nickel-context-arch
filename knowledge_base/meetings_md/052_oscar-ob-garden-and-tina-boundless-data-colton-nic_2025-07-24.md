Colton O'Farrell: . Good morning, Tina. Good morning. How are we doing this morning?
Tina White: Doing well, thank you. How about you?
Colton O'Farrell: Same here. Can't complain. Just enjoying the nice weather we have in Chicago right now. Otherwise, it's been really rainy and will be raining the next couple days. So you're in Florida though, so you can definitely relate to that, I'm sure.
Tina White: Yes, yes. We got lots of rain yesterday.
Oscar Rodriguez: Yeah.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah. Do you guys deal, are you dealing much with like flooding or?
Tina White: I haven't left the house, so I understand that, too. What's going on outside? So I don't know. I, I know that the yard looked like it was going to flood, but it didn't.
Colton O'Farrell: In Chicago, too, just with how the city is, like, set up over, you know, the last few hundred years, they're constantly trying to improve the flooding, but every time it rains, like, a lot of the streets just get so full of water, and luckily, I'm not in one of those. areas too much, but yeah, it's pretty crazy. But thanks again for joining. So Oscar will be jumping on the call in just a moment, I assume.
Tina White: Yes, he should be. Let's see. If he's having trouble connecting, let me find out what's going on.
Colton O'Farrell: He just accepted it, so I think he should be joining in just a moment.
Tina White: Oh, okay.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, it just came in like two seconds ago. But while we're waiting, here he is.
Oscar Rodriguez: Hi, y'all. Hey, how you doing?
Colton O'Farrell: Doing well.
Oscar Rodriguez: How are you? Doing and I'm doing it.
Colton O'Farrell: Awesome. Well, really appreciate taking the time to hop on this call, Oscar. So I know you and Tina, of course, have had lots of discussions. Tina and myself, we spoke for about I think like 40-ish minutes back on July 1st. She had a lot of questions, talked about your business model, kind of the things that were a priority for you. So I do have the notes from that previous call here, reviewed your business a little bit. But just wanted to really open up the floor to you. If you have any particular questions based on your conversations with Tina, for me, or if there's something I can show you in the platform, just really want to understand your business most and how we could best help you.
Oscar Rodriguez: Got you, understood. Well, I'm pretty sure you went over with Tina on that. We're pretty much more retail company. What we do is we sell landscape services to our customers. We pick them up on the fields, we'll bring them to a store, and then from the store goes to different customers. We do both. We do some installations and we do deliveries for homeowners to do it themselves. 75% of our business is just pretty much deliveries. So homeowners, they do it themselves.
Colton O'Farrell: Self serving mostly. You're just providing the material. They're doing all the like installation work and then about 25% of the time you're doing the installation work.
Oscar Rodriguez: That is correct. That is correct. So that's pretty much what we do.
Colton O'Farrell: And the biggest concern for you, it sounds like there's been some check and mail fraud or running fraudulent credit cards mostly. and then you're getting the charge back on those after the delivery has been completed.
Oscar Rodriguez: That is correct. What happened is that the material that we sell is a type of material that it's not a refrigerator or it's not something that if you don't take care of it, it will last. So it's very perishable. So one of the biggest issues we have and When I said biggest issue, biggest issue for me, I really don't think that we compare without other SAD companies out there because, you know, we all talk, they got a lot more problems than ours. We try to secure ourselves as much as we can in our end, but you know how credit cards and things are out there that sometimes they find the loophole of how to be able to get in.
Colton O'Farrell: Right.
Oscar Rodriguez: For example, the credit card company that we have now, I believe in the last year, year and a half, teen, I believe that we have been with them correct.
Colton O'Farrell: Is that melio or go cardless?
Oscar Rodriguez: That is what, I'm sure.
Colton O'Farrell: Was that melio or go cardless? I know you were working with both of 'em.
Oscar Rodriguez: No, no no less.
Tina White: That it it was, uh, Ebs's charge.
Oscar Rodriguez: Ebis charge is the one we have been working for the past year, year and a half.
Colton O'Farrell: That's Ebis charge.
Oscar Rodriguez: That is correct.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah.
Oscar Rodriguez: Okay. So, and, and I believe it was, it was only one or two issues in the whole year.
Colton O'Farrell: Nice.
Oscar Rodriguez: And now I, I will say 75 of ourselves, well, I would say close to 80, 85. is credit cards. So I believe that, you know, one or two issues that they, which they, they finally got the Lupo and they went inside. It was not that bad.
Colton O'Farrell: But for us, when did these mostly start again? So you said just in the last year?
Oscar Rodriguez: A year, year and a half. We have been with this credit card company.
Colton O'Farrell: But it was good the first year and then the issue.
Oscar Rodriguez: No, no, no, it's been great. It's not a problem. What I'm trying to say is in this amount of time, we only had, I believe, two charge packs. And one of the charge packs.
Colton O'Farrell: It.
Oscar Rodriguez: Was approved by, how does that sound, Colton?
Tina White: A 3D secure.
Oscar Rodriguez: A 3D secure. It was, it was, you know, they, it was run by that. So I guess it went through and, you know, they, they, they, up to today, they still have not paid it back to me. So we are fighting that with them right now. Because if we had a 3D security, if it was in place and everything was supposed to be working, the way it's supposed to be working.
Colton O'Farrell: Right.
Oscar Rodriguez: We, we shouldn't be charged for, that charge back.
Colton O'Farrell: Exactly. So it sounds like there was somebody dropped the ball on their side with their.
Oscar Rodriguez: Exactly. Exactly. so that's what it is. So what I'm trying to say is that the amount of credit cards that we do, if we have one or two issues, three, I don't know, that's a lot. We're very good. We have a very good security in place. We try customers to sign when we have forms that when they, they, you know, they request to pay us credit card, we send them forms, emails that they sign, the horn, IER, so. Yep, pretty much covered. So it isn't very important to us to have that. Now, the questions that I have for you, the first one has to do with the, with the QuickBooks.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep.
Oscar Rodriguez: The current company that we have right now, when we create an invoice, okay? We have to send that, we have to do two steps. That invoice is sent and it goes to that, to their platform, which I know yours, one of the ways is like that because I saw the demo that you sent Tina. And then from that platform, you send it to the customer. Now, I was told by Tina, cause what I'm looking for is when we get it, when we get in QuickBooks, we send that invoice, that invoice goes to the customer. Is that how your second auction is? Yes.
Colton O'Farrell: Yes.
Oscar Rodriguez: So we don't have to go to your website for anything?
Colton O'Farrell: Correct, yes. Well, if you wanted to have like a bird's eye view, you wouldn't have to go to the website to send these off. But if you wanted to see like transaction history, chargebacks, things, I mean, that's gonna also populate in QuickBooks too. But if you wanted to see that within Nickel, you of course could log in to see that. What I, I'll show you quickly what, so you obviously saw the demo with connecting the QuickBooks account. Just gonna share my screen here for a moment. So with that demo I showed you, if you go to account settings here, you just go to integrations, you click this green link QuickBooks account, you sign into your, into your company account, select your chart of accounts, bring all that over. And this demo account, I don't have that connected, but I have a screenshot of what it looks like if you were. So it would list your company here, it would list your QuickBooks ID, and then there would be this bottom option to automate payment links. So what this would do is we would send a payment link via Nickel anytime an invoice is created in QuickBooks. But the one cat, so what that removes is we're sending it through QuickBooks, but you're not going to be charged the 1% ACH like fee that QuickBooks would charge because we're the payment processor and we're handling it. ACH is always free with us. the one time where it's not good to have this turned on is if once you generate an invoice, you're having to go back into it, edit it, make modifications, or have multiple people review that and adjust it. Because each time you do that, your customer would get an email for each of those changes. So if you're typically creating an invoice and it's ready to send, don't need to do much else, it's great to have that automation on. But if you are modifying it and changing it a lot, I would recommend turning the automation off. and then just coming into Nickel and just firing them off right on the far hand side. You can also select a multiple at one time to send them at the same time. These are some previous ones that we've already sent, but you are able to do multi sending of that as well. Right.
Oscar Rodriguez: Well, that's, I'm trying to, I'm trying to, you see, what happened here in the office is that is, everything is quick. When someone calls to place an order, remember, sometimes you got two or three lines going at the same time. So what we try to do, if we work it on QuickBooks, invoices are only changed if the customer requests an invoice. Let's put it this way. It's not something that we did. You calling me, you want five pallets of sod delivered to your home, your zip code, your five pallet, and this is what you want. And we're gonna go ahead and boom, what you want, send you an invoice for paper. me. Now, if you're gonna call me an hour later and say, okay, Oscar, listen, I don't want five, I want seven, then we're gonna go back to that invoice and we're gonna change and we're gonna send it again. And that's the one they paying. Right, right. You understand what I'm saying? So it's that we send them invoices and then we're like, oh, we made a mistake.
Colton O'Farrell: Let me go back to the question. When do they pay you when you send that invoice? Are they paying you when you show up with the delivery? Are they paying you running the card?
Oscar Rodriguez: Like you got Parade on the phone. Everything is paid before sod leaves the store. So it's like, it's like if you ordering Home Depot right now online and you go to Home Depot or you go to Amazon, wherever you go, you pick up what you want and you pay. And then the delivery comes in two days or three days or whatever, whenever is scheduled to come in.
Colton O'Farrell: Because one suggestion or a potential workaround that I just wanted to kind of pick your brain on this a little bit, but we set this up for another Company, they're like a window and door installation company, but they have really high value, really high value like invoices. And typically what they would do is they want to have a solution where they can show up to a business or like the residential area that they're working on a project with like a QR code that their customer would scan right then and there and just make the payment as is there. They wanted and we have been building something for them. I don't know if that would be helpful for what you're doing, but if that's also a potential solution that I just wanted to run by you and kind of see what you think about that.
Oscar Rodriguez: Well, that will be maybe something in the future, like I said. Yeah.
Colton O'Farrell: If there's other interests with other companies, I know we can definitely expedite getting that built out as well.
Oscar Rodriguez: Yeah, that'll be fine. As of right now, I'm just explaining to you how, what is the system that we have. We send you an invoice, you look at the invoice, you click to pay. and you pay that comes to us, it goes into the board for delivery on Wednesday, for example, next Wednesday. Okay, next Wednesday is going to be the delivery. So that's how that works. So that is that part now. So you said that yes, from QuickBooks, you send that invoice to that particular email. Oscar at O'Farrell, then Oscar is going to receive that email and it's going to click and it's going to pay. We don't have to go, if we want to check what is not being paid, this and that, then we go to Nickel and we check that out or whatever things happening. Okay, let's talk about the fees now. The fees are being paid 100% by the customer.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, I'm gonna pull up the pricing page here quickly so I can just kind of talk through this as well. So on the accounts receivable side, By default, if your customer wants to pay you via credit card, and I'll pop over here as well, 100% of that surcharge, so 2.99%, will be paid for by your customer. So this is the global rule where you would set that up. So by default, again, 100% of the customer pays that. If you wanted to change this global rule, we do give you the control to change it to whatever percentage you like. But again, by default, 100% of the customer is going to pay that. However, if you wanted to override the global rules, For one individual invoice, for example, we have this one here. This is a customer we agreed to split that credit card surcharge cost 50/50. You can come right in here, turn that on, and just switch it like that. And that's gonna override the global settings just for this particular invoice. I don't imagine you wanna do that, but it is an option that you do have.
Oscar Rodriguez: It's an option.
Colton O'Farrell: Exactly. And then from the pricing standpoint, so just to clarify this, So we have two, you can ignore this FAR plan here. Nickel Core and Nickel Plus are the two main plans that you'd be evaluating. So with Nickel Core, that's our completely free plan. There's no charges with this plan. The only way that you would pay for something is if you agree to eat that accounts receivable credit card surcharge, or if you're paying bills via Nickel on the accounts payable side with a credit card, because you're obviously not gonna be sending that to your customer. But otherwise, there's no cost with this account. It's literally a free subscription. There are some limitations, and I'm not sure that this would fit your business model. It might, but the limitations are you only can have three active users. You only can do $25,000 per ACH transaction. That's not cumulative, meaning you could do 100 of those. You just cannot do one at $26,000. You get access to a customer payment portal, which is right here. Most of our customers will take this and embed it in their own website. kind of serves as a backup method or one stop shop for a customer to come in and make any payment. It's completely customizable. You just come in here, your customer would come in here, make whatever kind of payment they want. If they're paying via card, 2.99% fee there. If they're paying via ACH in their bank, free. They just need to enter their routing and account number. But yeah, that's, I guess for the ACH processing time, because I know that's important for you on the free plan. It is generally two to three day turnaround times. We are still required to meet the cutoff time of our sponsor bank, which is 4:00 PM Eastern Standard Time. So as long as you get it in before that time, you should be getting on the free plan, a two to three day at the latest ACH processing. However, when you come to Nickel Plus, you get everything I mentioned on the free plan plus a lot of additional features. So the plan, the pricing for that is either $45 monthly or $35 a month with a 20% discount on an annual subscription. Again, there's no other costs here, no hidden fees or transaction costs. The only way that you would be paying more than this is if you're eating that credit card surcharge or you're paying bills with a credit card via Nickel on the accounts payable side. We removed the limits of active users, so you get unlimited users. We bump up the limit from $25,000 to just under a million dollars, but that's negotiable. You can schedule payments in advance, you can do recurring payments in advance. And we have just recently enabled this, well, it's in a beta testing, but remote check deposit, where if a customer mails you a check, you take a picture of it, you can get it paid and uploaded and transferred to your bank.
Oscar Rodriguez: But questions with the pricing there? No, I don't have any questions with the pricing. I do have a question. Yeah. On the plus, which that's the one we're thinking to go on.
Colton O'Farrell: Plus?
Oscar Rodriguez: On the plus, which is the $35 a month.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep.
Oscar Rodriguez: We do not, okay, let's go back. When we send an email to a customer for payment, the customer has a choice to pay ACH.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep, correct. Unless you turn it off, you do have the option to turn it off though.
Tina White: Oh, you told me before that you couldn't turn off ACH.
Colton O'Farrell: You can turn it. So when you go to set up, so specifically when it comes to setting up a customer, sorry, it's on the actually on the vendor side. So this is more on the accounts payable side. if you're setting up a new vendor, you do have the option to let's go back here. Yeah, so I mean, so I guess we can require ACH here, which would turn off the credit cards. I believe there is an option. It's a recent development, Tina, since we last spoke. It's been about a month or at least three weeks.
Tina White: I'm not talking about vendors. I'm talking about customers. Right.
Colton O'Farrell: And let me just double check on that, but I know for sure you can turn off on an individual invoice level like credit cards. So right here you could go ahead.
Tina White: And- yeah, but you already sent the invoice. If we're set to automatic, you already sent the invoice, so they can't go and turn it off.
Colton O'Farrell: That's in that case, we wouldn't have the automation. You could toggle the automation off if you needed to adjust the credit card. So it is still feasible.
Tina White: No, their primary goal here. Well, one of their primary goals is to have the automation. So they don't have to go to two platforms because they're too busy to be required to do that.
Colton O'Farrell: So with the ideal workflow that you and Oscar have mentioned, probably wouldn't be the best example. I would just leave it as is. Your customer can decide to pay via ACH or they can decide to pay via credit card. And I wanted to let you know, like the fraud protection element is one of the best kind of selling points for Nickel. So, If anyone was going to get hit, it would be Nickel before it'd be your business. Because how we're operating is we have our own bank, we have our own account, that money is being pulled from our account to you and to transfer to your customers. So if anyone was to get hit first, your account is not the one that's on the line. And Nickel has a ton of compliance regulatory vetting processes that are in place to prevent any kind of fraud because we would be the ones on the hook for that. If that makes sense.
Oscar Rodriguez: Are you talking about ACH or are you talking about credit cards?
Colton O'Farrell: Regardless, either or. So what I'm saying is when your customer makes a payment, what, just curious, what are the average kind of invoice amounts that you're sending?
Oscar Rodriguez: An invoice could be $60 or an invoice could be $15,000.
Colton O'Farrell: So let's say for example, a $15,000 invoice is being paid to you, so your customer pays that, We are pulling that $15,000 from our own account and getting it into yours. So it's not like we're taking it directly from their account and putting it into yours. We're taking their money and we're getting it into our account, but we're taking that money from our account and getting it to yours first. Right.
Oscar Rodriguez: So what you're saying is if someone pay ACH today and he pays $2,500, that money is gonna be in my account the next day and you're gonna deal with the issues of the bank and the customer if it's a problem. Is that what you're saying?
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, absolutely. We wouldn't take on any high-risk customers or like if you have, we would flag any potential, like if we notice you're working with someone that maybe has fraudulent activity or risk or we would, we also vet and are assessing that as well.
Oscar Rodriguez: We don't want that kind of people.
Colton O'Farrell: Exactly. Neither do we.
Oscar Rodriguez: We really don't want. So, okay. But I just wanted to make sure about that. Okay.
Tina White: I wanted to say something about the invoices. When you create the invoice in QuickBooks, Oscar.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah.
Oscar Rodriguez: Give me a second, Tina. Johnny, can you please see why Rayne wants? I'm on the phone and let's go.
Colton O'Farrell: Back and tell me.
Oscar Rodriguez: I'm sorry, Tina, go ahead.
Tina White: That's okay. When an invoice is created in QuickBooks, the email is sent from Nickel with a Nickel template based on what you created the invoice in QuickBooks. So I just wanted to make sure that was clear that the invoice, the email for the invoice is not coming from QuickBooks. You can send also send one from QuickBooks if you want, but it automatically will go to Nickel, right, Colton?
Colton O'Farrell: So we're going to be sending it from this receipts@nickelpayments.com address, and the reason we do that is for deliverability. So we can't have custom emails for all of our customers to send to their customers because if, say, for example, people don't realize that they're marketing it as spam or something, flagging it, we could really mess up the deliverability rates if we did one-off processes for each customer. I mean, we have 10,000 companies we're working with. This email has extremely good deliverability. We don't run into any issues with customers not getting it. That's what Tina was talking about, where It will be coming from this receipts@nickelpayments.com, but again, it's going to say OB Garden Saab here. It would also say that here, you can put your logo there. So it will be branded, but it does have to come from the receipts at Nickel.
Oscar Rodriguez: So, right, no, no, and that's fine. I don't have a problem. I don't care if it's QuickBooks or Nicos or Pepe Gonzalez. I really don't know where the email is coming from. What I do have, what I do want to make sure that when when I reach, for example, if I'm the one paying and OB said sent me an email and it's coming from nickel, I want to make sure that he says ob side from nickel, nickel for ob side, whatever it is. So people know that the email is coming from ob side that they're going to pay because they don't know who Nico is. So is that how it comes in? And we, you know, I would like to, I would like for you to, you know, before we do anything to send me an email so I can look at it like a bill that I want to pay or something like that. So I want to see how it looks. Can you do it?
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah. Curious. So can you tell me a little bit? So what are you doing in terms of average customers that you're working with and then also company Revenue annually? So that's not. We don't change pricing or anything for that. But I do have more leeway with kind of larger company business wise. Just curious, what are you doing for, like, number of customers and then annual company revenue.
Oscar Rodriguez: Well, let's talk about customers. Customer, we open to any customers. Remember, we talked about already that is a retail business. So whoever picked up the phone or whoever Googles, Tampa, so we can get a new customer every single day and we have returning customers as well. so that's our area. I can't tell you how many customers we have of course.
Colton O'Farrell: What about from a revenue perspective?
Oscar Rodriguez: Well, revenue for us, you want a revenue on credit cards or you want.
Colton O'Farrell: A revenue on total annual revenue for your company?
Oscar Rodriguez: Well, on your revenue, we're at about 1.8, 1.9.
Colton O'Farrell: 1.9 million?
Oscar Rodriguez: Yes, sir.
Colton O'Farrell: Let's go ahead and do this then. Oscar, I'm going to send you an email quick. I'm going to send you $50 via Nickel and I'm going to send that as a bill pay. So I'm going to pay you via Nickel. So you first, what I'm going to do is I'm going to set you up as a vendor. So right here, just so you can see an email of kind of what it's going to look like and what that process you may be not be doing this exact workflow because this is on the accounts payable side, but this will be a way to show you what Nickel can do, how easy it is to receive payments. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to new vendor here. I don't know all of your information, so I'm gonna ask you to fill that out. Just gonna put name. Would you like OB garden sod? Is that the preferred? OB, OB sod.
Oscar Rodriguez: OB sod.
Colton O'Farrell: Well, I'm not in a computer.
Oscar Rodriguez: I'm in my cell phone. You can still, you'll still be able.
Colton O'Farrell: To get an email and to fill out the details.
Oscar Rodriguez: Yeah, well, I'm in front of the computer, but what I'm trying to tell you is you can send it to my email, oscar@obgarden.com.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, so I'll actually be sending you money with this. So here what I'm going to do is I'm going to first send you, it's going to send you an email that's going to have you enter your details. Once that's done, I will go ahead and send you a payment via Nickel so you can see how easy it is to send and receive payments. But I think that might be a good demonstration. And I do have that capacity if you're above a million dollars in revenue. So that's why that's where that question came from. But Tina, while Oscar's doing that, do you have any specific questions or anything that you want to touch on while he's filling out that information?
Tina White: I was I was thinking I was so hyper focused on the email pay that I forgot about in person transactions. But I spoke with Ilaed this morning. She's one of Oscar's people. And she does most of the phone transactions. So she said it shouldn't be a problem because I thought, oh, well, every time you create an invoice for an in person, Transaction that's going to generate an email from from nickel, right?
Colton O'Farrell: One more time.
Tina White: They have an in person transactions.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep.
Tina White: And they use a terminal for that. They use a on premise device for that.
Colton O'Farrell: And they just like hold it up the customer. What do they do? Are they scanning? Are they just entering the phone?
Tina White: I have no idea, but they still enter something into QuickBooks for that customer.
Colton O'Farrell: So that's what I was concerned about.
Tina White: I was concerned that that would automatically go to Nickel and then the customer would be confused with, oh, why did I get this email to pay? But they don't, it's typically a sales receipt. Do sales receipts?
Colton O'Farrell: Yep, we have sales.
Tina White: No, it's not an invoice. Created in QuickBooks is a sales receipt. Does a sales receipt trigger that automation? Or only invoices?
Colton O'Farrell: Which automation back into QuickBooks Online? No.
Tina White: The automation, I create an invoice in QuickBooks that automatically goes to Nickel and Nickel sends an email to collect that payment. What about sales receipts?
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, I know we generate those. So this is what I was talking about before of a potential solution for another customer is where you show the QR code, they scan it, they could pay right then and there. We could also work potentially with the system that you have in place today. But I'm happy to ask the team and get answers for that. I just know And you'll see this in just a moment, once I send this bill, you'll get like a PDF invoice right from here that I'll also share with Oscar as well.
Tina White: Okay, well, I'm not talking about that. You're getting off track.
Colton O'Farrell: But.
Tina White: Anyway, I'll let Oscar continue, because I'm sure you both have limited time. Theoretically, a sales receipt should not have an email attached to it. So if there's no email, you can't send an email, right? That solves that problem, correct?
Colton O'Farrell: Yes, it should.
Tina White: Okay, thank you.
Oscar Rodriguez: Right, and also you've got customers that comes and pay cash on the store. So there's no reason why they should be getting an email. So I guess that should be an auction that if you want to send it or not.
Colton O'Farrell: And Oscar, just to confirm, you want this to be sent as a check to you, not just added to your bank account.
Oscar Rodriguez: Yeah, that's fine.
Colton O'Farrell: Okay, so.
Oscar Rodriguez: That'S fine. Cool.
Colton O'Farrell: So we do have the option to send this as a check like you noticed here. It is there is just a $2 fee with that and it does take a little bit longer. Obviously, we have to get that through the mail. But here I am going to be, let's see, we're just going to pay via our bank account right there. Review.
Tina White: You should have chose the ACH Oscar so that you could see how fast it comes.
Colton O'Farrell: No worries, the check option works as well. But yeah, if it was ACH, it would generally be same day right into your account. But we will be mailing that check to you. Here's the PDF invoice that's just auto-generated there. But yeah, I mean, it's very easy to use Nickel. I know that we'll be able to help prevent the fraud issues that you've dealt with in the past. Just question, I mean, what else do you need to learn from me before you set up your Nickel account, mess around with it, see if it's a solution that works for you? What else can help provide or answer?
Oscar Rodriguez: I want you to send me an invoice if I need to pay you.
Colton O'Farrell: I can send you like a practice invoice. You want to see that? Yeah.
Oscar Rodriguez: It's like something that how we're going to be, how the customer is going to be receiving the invoices.
Colton O'Farrell: I mean, it'll look exactly like this. I'm happy to generate one right now if you want. We got about six minutes before I get kicked off the call here. But if you want me to, I would just have to add you as a customer. All right. So we're going to add you as a customer here.
Oscar Rodriguez: And nothing.
Colton O'Farrell: All right, going to generate that invoice. Since I'm not connected to QuickBooks, I have to do it manually, but very easy to do still. And I'll send this for just a small amount, so you don't accidentally somebody doesn't accidentally try to pay this or something. We'll just send this for $150. Let's see. And I'm just going to attach a mock invoice. So we're not generating one. You could attach one from QuickBooks if you like. This is just like a simple PDF to show you that one is actually attached, but it's nothing generated from Nickel. But I'm just going to go ahead and hit create. Going to go ahead and send that to your email. You want to go ahead and share your screen once you've received that just so we can talk from it from that standpoint.
Oscar Rodriguez: That's inconvenient. Who's DGRAD distribution?
Colton O'Farrell: That's my demo account.
Oscar Rodriguez: Oh, that's the demo account.
Colton O'Farrell: So that is the email. Yep.
Oscar Rodriguez: Okay, so this is how it looks.
Colton O'Farrell: Exactly.
Oscar Rodriguez: And then where it says DGRA, distribution incorporated, that's where it will say OB side.
Colton O'Farrell: Exactly. Yep. So you would just come into settings right here and you would customize it right here. So I added the name, added the logo for that payment portal. This is the banner that would be showing up. So on that previous screen I showed you before, right here, that is this. And so you have complete customization and control with that.
Oscar Rodriguez: Okay.
Tina White: Are we able to change text?
Colton O'Farrell: Yep. So we can pretty much customize this entire thing here. If you're also set up on Nickel Plus, we can give you a custom URL or domain as well. That's just We don't do that for Nickel Core customers, but that is something we can do for Nickel Plus.
Tina White: Okay. And did you have anything else you wanted to ask before we get instructions for starting the program?
Colton O'Farrell: No.
Oscar Rodriguez: The question will be, what is it that we need? How long is... Okay, so if we decided once we finish now that we're going to go with you, and we start the account. When we start making sales, do you have a trial period or the money comes the next month?
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah. So you'd any customer who gets set up with nickel, they get set up on the free plan, the nickel core plan. We do offer all customers a 14 day free trial of nickel plus. If you love it, it just rolls over to either 35 a month. on the annual subscription or $45 monthly. If you don't love it and you want to revert back to the free plan, you're also able to do that. You're also able to completely self-serve so you don't need me or anybody else to make that decision or help you. You just come right into account settings, come to plans, and then you would just click to upgrade to Nickel Plus and you can switch between monthly or you can switch between annual.
Oscar Rodriguez: Okay, so when you said monthly and annual, what does that mean? If you want annually is 35 and if you want to pay monthly basis is 45.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, well, yes, so it's either on the annual plan, it's $35 a month, which equates to one bill of $420 or you can pay for it monthly with being $45 a month and you would just pay for that each month.
Oscar Rodriguez: Okay, all right. And once we start making sales for whatever we start using your credit, your business tomorrow, we will get funded the next day, is that correct?
Colton O'Farrell: If you're on Nickel Plus and you're meeting the cutoff, you're getting that in before the cutoff times, yes.
Oscar Rodriguez: Okay.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, exactly.
Oscar Rodriguez: Yeah, you just want to make sure about that. Once we start doing you using you, then the following date, whatever we sell before four o'clock, it will be funded the next day.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep. Sorry to cut you off here, Oscar. We will be automatically booted from this Zoom call in just about a minute. So the next steps on your end, I would suggest is create your Nickel account if you've not already done that. You just need to link a payment method in order to start sending and receiving payments. But once you do that, you're ready to rock and roll. If you want to go into account settings, click the integration button, you can do that. You can bring in all your invoices, all your customers, everything directly into Nickel. But that would be my recommendation to start. Like I said, we're about to get kicked off this meeting, so if it ends, that is why. Any last minute questions or thoughts? Does that sound like a good plan for you?
Oscar Rodriguez: Anything that we have to do to make sure that we send the emails from QuickBooks? Because that's all I wanted to get it done. Is there anything special to do?
Colton O'Farrell: No, just the workflow that I showed you, you can either toggle the automation or you have that automation off and then you just come into Nickel and send those off. I know you're busy, so you'd likely have that automation turned on.
Oscar Rodriguez: All right. Okay. Tina, anything else? No, I think that's it.
Colton O'Farrell: Cool.
Tina White: Okay, you got it.
Oscar Rodriguez: You're here for us soon. Thank you.
Colton O'Farrell: Awesome.
Oscar Rodriguez: Sounds great.
Colton O'Farrell: Have a wonderful day. Appreciate it.
Oscar Rodriguez: Thanks, Tina.
Colton O'Farrell: Bye-bye.
