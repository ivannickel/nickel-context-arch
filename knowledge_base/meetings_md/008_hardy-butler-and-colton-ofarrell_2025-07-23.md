Hardy Butler: . . . Morning.
Colton O'Farrell: Good morning, Hardy. How's it going today?
Hardy Butler: I'm great. How are you?
Colton O'Farrell: Doing really well on my end. Just got all set up here. Really appreciate you taking the time to meet with me today. Typically how these conversations go is I wanna learn more about you, your business, how you found Nickel, any current challenges that you're dealing with. Once I have a better understanding of your business and use cases, I'll show you the Nickel platform, tailor it to those use cases. Then we'll wrap up discussing which plan's a good fit for you. If there's any next steps or questions I need answered and yeah, then we'll get you started on becoming a Nickel user or hopefully finding a solution that meets your needs. But how does that sound, Hardy?
Hardy Butler: Perfect.
Colton O'Farrell: Awesome. Well, I'll let you take it away then if you want to tell me a little bit more about how you found Nickel, you, your business, that'd be really helpful information.
Hardy Butler: Yep. So I run a bookkeeping, accounting and fractional CFO firm and we're probably We have 15 people on the team and we've got maybe 150 clients or so.
Colton O'Farrell: Okay.
Hardy Butler: We use bill.com, we use RAMP, we use Brex, we use Intuit Bill Pay or whatever they're calling their solution. We used to use Melio, Melio, however you pronounce that. We still do in some instances, but that's gotten less desirable.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, and why has that been? Is that because of some pricing changes?
Hardy Butler: Well, to be quite frank, it was 'cause it was a free option, a free alternative. I mean, that's kind of what's motivated my request for the call today is, you know, so I found you on, I just was Googling around looking for, I mean, There is a tremendous need. Maybe you're getting ready to tell me, yes, we know this. This is exactly why we created Nickel. But I want to be able to send ACH payments in low volume or frankly on an as needed basis without paying an absurd monthly platform fee. And I don't even mind like The fact that Nickel is free is nice. I mean, I don't know how you're making money, to be quite frank, and that's one of the things I want to find out.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, happy to explain that for you.
Hardy Butler: Because I don't want to partner with someone that's, you know, I work with a lot of early stage companies, a lot of VC backed companies. I'm guessing you're probably backed by some of something like that. And I want to make sure that we're not partnering with somebody that's, I want to make sure you have a sustainable business model.
Colton O'Farrell: Totally fair.
Hardy Butler: But the fact that it's free is not, that's nice. And I don't mind paying for an ACH, a reasonable fee. But what we need is for our smaller clients who need to be able to make an ACH payment occasionally from time to time. I don't want to have to pay $7 to a bank. Shouldn't have to pay a platform.
Colton O'Farrell: Just to get money into your account, it's crazy.
Hardy Butler: Yeah, and you know, I've been doing this long enough now that I remember when a paper check was deemed to be the safer method because the internet was not as secure as ironically as I think it is today. But there's no question that with all the check washing that's going on out there, that an electronic payment is by far the safest method to go.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep.
Hardy Butler: And I'm just trying to be a diligent partner with my clients and tell them, stop writing paper checks.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah. How's that been going for you?
Hardy Butler: Actually, for those who have the volume to get on bill.com, surprisingly well.
Colton O'Farrell: Awesome.
Hardy Butler: There are some who still resist it, but I've been pleasantly surprised actually. I expected it was gonna be much more difficult than it has been. And again, just because someone has the volume to go on bill.com, if your platform and solution is pretty slick and good, hell, we'll consider that. But my biggest concerns or my biggest goal is I need to be able to make an ACH payment inexpensively as needed, as if it were a bank transaction and not an act of Congress.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, that's a great phrasing for it.
Hardy Butler: And I absolutely want to make sure that wherever I'm directing my clients, it's under a sustainable business model. And so I want to understand a little bit more about who Nickel is, how your, you know, what your revenue model is, what makes you sustainable.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, I'm happy to answer that for you. No, that is really great context. It seems like you have a great understanding of the problem today. And I mean, you kind of walked me into like my usual pitch. So what you've stated, that's exactly the reason why Nickel came into conception. So we've been around about two years, but we already have over 10,000 businesses who are transacting with Nickel via accounts receivable, accounts payable, or both. Really, the idea behind Nickel is there was all these companies like QuickBooks Online, Melio, Bill.com, a number of other providers who all provided free ACH to their clients. They built huge followings. a lot of customer love referrals reviews and then overnight they realize, hey, you know what? This is a, we got the customers. We could turn this into a revenue making model. They switched that companies went from paying nothing to hundreds or thousands of dollars just to simply get money into their bank account. A lot of these companies are small businesses. They have three to 6% margins. So if you're taking a 1% fee on that ACH, I mean, They pissed off a lot of customers and we noticed the need. So our founders decided to build a free solution that meets those exact needs of those small businesses. They found that if you do that, you're really gonna drive a lot of customers, signups, reviews, referrals. I'm not sure if you're familiar with G2, but if you look up Nickel's reviews on G2, you're gonna find that we have a 4.9 out of five rating. we're ranked the number one easiest payment solution to use. You could literally compare us next to Melio or next to Bill.com, and the results there will speak for itself. But kind of the part of the approach that we've taken, so even if we're not making money from some of these customers, there's, you know, what we have is like the network effect. Each customer that comes on, it's very likely that they're gonna bring on multiple customers with them. Even if they don't sign up to use us directly, they're still gonna be transacting with Nickel. And we're actually already a cash positive business. So I do know we're planning on raising our series A here in the near future, but we're already a profitable business. I expect that they will raise a ton of money. Yeah, and like I said, customers are very happy. So we're already a profitable business. Leadership's got really the right track. We are a product-led growth company initially. So we're starting to kind of now go hunt for some of those larger accounts. finding a lot of success there. But before that, 95% of all of our customers self-served and signed up themselves. So I'll pause there. Any specific questions on kind of that backstory or does that seem to make sense for you?
Hardy Butler: Yeah, so here's an interesting request that you've probably never heard before. Yeah, let's hear it. Ask your founders if they'd be willing to send me their pitch deck for their series seed raise. Yeah. Cause that'll answer a lot of the questions that I have that'll be, And if they're already building their, if they're already building their roadmap to go raise their series A, I'd be interested in looking at their, their deck for that, too. Yeah.
Colton O'Farrell: Be sure to ask the founders for that.
Hardy Butler: And again, don't, don't mislead them. I mean, I'm happy to look at it as an investor. We do a fair amount of angel investing, so we touch series A, but we're usually more in the seed round. But it's not, I'm not doing that from the perspective of trying to weasel my way into the cap table.
Colton O'Farrell: I'm really just more understanding. You think it will answer a lot of the questions that you have kind of seeing how they were, you know, selling.
Hardy Butler: I mean, in theory, I can sign up for Nickel today.
Colton O'Farrell: Mm-.
Hardy Butler: Cost me nothing.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep.
Hardy Butler: So how are you cash flow positive? How are you even generating revenue?
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah. Here, let me just go ahead and share our pricing page with you. I can kind of walk through that and I think that will answer some of your questions.
Hardy Butler: Okay.
Colton O'Farrell: So here's the pricing page. You let me know you can see that. Okay.
Hardy Butler: Yep.
Colton O'Farrell: Awesome. So, yes. What are you talking about?
Hardy Butler: I can see it. Yeah.
Colton O'Farrell: Here. If I need to zoom in a little bit.
Hardy Butler: Yeah.
Colton O'Farrell: So nickel core is the free plan that you were referring to. That's what every customer gets set up when they get started with nickel. What that plan allows for is it allows for free, unlimited ach transactions. There are some caveats with the plan. So one of those being that you are limited to twenty five thousand dollars per ach transaction. So again, this core plan is designed more for smaller, non-postile businesses. As long this is not a cumulative amount, so you can do 100 of those transactions, you just cannot do one at $26,000. Some other limitations are we only allow for three active users on the free account, and then you cannot do scheduling or recurring payments. Those are only features that are part of our Plus plan. We typically see a two to three day turnaround time for the ACH processing, We are still required to meet the bank cutoff times of 4:00 PM Eastern Standard Time, but as long as it's done by that time, generally seeing a two to three day turnaround time on all ACH payments. Otherwise, everything else that I'll show you in the platform is included. And the free plan, especially this customer payment portal that a lot of our customers really enjoy, they'll typically take that and embed it in their own website. They're able to customize it however they like. But besides the recurring and scheduling of payments and then the limit at 25,000 there on the Plus plan, so that's either $45 monthly or it's $35 a month with these plans. So there are no hidden fees, there's no transaction costs. The only way that our customers would be paying anything more than this subscription cost is if they agree to eat some of the credit card surcharge on the accounts receivable side when their customers are paying them. By default, 100% of that cost is for the customers to pay. But if they wanted to change that, that is huge.
Hardy Butler: I'm assuming you know that because I saw it pitched in some of your stuff online. But it's such a big need for people to be able to send an invoice and have an electronic payment option where without marking up your invoice manually, you can push the fee off to the payer.
Colton O'Farrell: And we handle all the PCI compliance, so you'd only get the net amount. You don't have to worry about any of the fees, obviously. So it's not really a credit card fee. It's a fee that Nickel itself is charging, and that's kind of how we are able to give you the control over that surcharge management. I'll show you what it looks like to set the global rule, and then you can actually go on an individual voice level, and you can override that rule if, for example, you have an agreement with one customer who you're going to split that fee 50/50. I'll show you how you're able to do that. Things to just call out on the Plus Plan. So we speed up the ACH processing. So as long as it's in before that 4:00 p.m. cutoff time, it's generally same day to two day turnaround time. We bump up the limit from $25,000 to just under a million dollars per transaction. You can schedule payments in advance. You can do recurring payments in advance. And we also give all customers 14 days free trial of Nickel Plus. You can actually go within the platform itself and upgrade as needed. If you decide after the 14 days that, you know, the nickel plus is more than you need, you can always revert back to the free plan. But really how we make money is we make money on the subscription costs and then credit card processing.
Hardy Butler: All right. So let me ask some questions.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, let's hear them.
Hardy Butler: I'll just go down the table. So Two versus, if we talk about the free plan, when you're talking about a three-day business, three business day turnaround, when you submit the ACH, do you get, do you get a, an indication of, you had said when you were talking about that, that it was two to three days, and I don't really care. I mean, for anybody that's gonna go on a free plan, you take what you can get. So I'm not worried about it. I'm curious, when you submit, does it give you a, a delivery date? Because a lot of times our, the recipient will want to know, hey, what's the scheduled ETA?
Colton O'Farrell: Yep. Yeah, it will give you a time frame. And I can actually show this too, specifically on, I know on our bill pay, if you're gonna pay bills, I'm not sure if you're looking at us for the accounts payable, but if you were to, let's just pull up this one as an example here. If I was to make a payment, we'll give you a timeline right here of the withdrawal date, same day delivery. So this is on a nickel plus plan. So it does give you a time. Frame of
Hardy Butler: when that would be. Completed. Okay. All right. Reactive users.
Colton O'Farrell: So.
Hardy Butler: What constitutes a user to you in particular as it relates to the integration with QuickBooks Online?
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, so a user would be an administrator or manager. We also have member view privileges only. So that's a view only, they're not able to interact with the platform, but you would be able to have like one administrator and then two managers on the plan. And then as many, you know, just member view only privileges as you'd like.
Hardy Butler: All right, so let me ask a more specific question, a very common setup. So for firms like ours, we use QuickBooks Online accountant. And when a client invites us to connect to their QuickBooks Online account, they do so as what's called an accountant user.
Colton O'Farrell: Yep.
Hardy Butler: Familiar with all this so far?
Colton O'Farrell: Yes, of course.
Hardy Butler: Right. And then I can allocate access to that QuickBooks Online file literally to all 15 of my team members if I want without impacting any limits on the number of users in the client's QuickBooks Online file. Then when we're doing the integration with Nickel, I assume that that doesn't come into play, it doesn't take up a user. You don't have to have a user to connect the integration. It's just, okay, so users truly means the number of users in the Nickel platform at your domain.
Colton O'Farrell: Exactly.
Hardy Butler: Okay, good. Let's see. All right, so free ACH, ACH pull and ACH push, I assume, but in your world, it's probably more about getting paid for an invoice or paying a bill. So I guess from a process standpoint for me, Creating a vendor bill and paying it, that's one thing good there. Generating an invoice to one of my customers, sending it and requesting payment, good there. What about if I just want to go in and enter a very simple ACH pull, for example, where I have the customer, I have the payers bank info, and they say, you know, you're authorized to draft this from my account by an ACH pull. Can I just go in and do that, or do I have to actually create an invoice and send that? Yeah.
Colton O'Farrell: So what do you have today for those payment authorization requests? Are they paper-based are they related to QuickBooks Online?
Hardy Butler: What kind of format do you have? What I just asked about doing, I don't have a method for doing it. Okay, gotcha.
Colton O'Farrell: I would have to create an invoice. Oh, I was just gonna say, if you do have any customer accounts that already have a payment authorization, we are able to honor those. The team has to obviously do the due diligence just because with the technology today, it's very easy for a company or for people to create fraudulent payments. So we are able to honor those. One caveat is there potentially is a slower processing time just because the team has to do their due diligence. But we also have it set up on the Nickel Plus Plan. That's another added feature is that you can send a payment authorization request to your customers. So when you're setting up a new customer or a new vendor here, so you just go to vendor, You go to new vendor. If you have their information, you can enter it. If you don't, we could ask the vendor to fill it out themselves. What the vendor would receive on their end is they would receive an email that looks like this. So it'd say your company wants to send you money via Nickel. We have frequently asked questions with answers right there. They would just go to fill vendor details out here. Again, if it was too long and they didn't read it on the first page, we do have the answers here. So letting them know all their information is protected. We're SOC 2 compliant. We handle all the PCI compliance elements. They would just say whether they're business, corporation, individual. They would go to how they would like to receive payments so we can send them.
Hardy Butler: Right. Can you get back a screen?
Colton O'Farrell: Yep.
Hardy Butler: All right. So they are not providing their W-9 info here. So that's something that we would be required to get.
Colton O'Farrell: So when it comes to setting up the vendor, so we are putting all the information we need in order to add them as a vendor to your account. So this is the, they would get an email that would have them, you know, fill in the information that they need here.
Hardy Butler: Right, but I see that it's not asking for anything that would be on a W-9. So presumably we would still be responsible for obtaining that info and issuing 1099s to vendors.
Colton O'Farrell: Currently that's not something that we're built out for in the platform, but it is something that is coming in the near future. Because that has been asked about from some other clients. So I do know that is something that they're working on. This is on the accounts payable, you know, setting up a vendor side. What else I was going to show you though with this is, if you're setting up a customer, so the workflows are the same, but if you go to customer here, new customer, we can actually send them a payment authorization request. So you just add the customer name, you click this, hit save, your customer will receive an email that looks like this, it would say payment authorization request from your company. If you have a memo or note that you want to add, you can do that. Again, those frequently asked some frequently asked questions with answers. They would just go to complete the authorization form. This is letting them know that this is an authorization from Nickel for your company to pull from their account upon agreed upon criteria. So you could set like a transaction limit threshold. A lot of people do like 25,000. You could set a timeframe, maybe like a year. They can revoke this. This is letting them know that this will allow you to auto pull from their account. They can cancel or revoke this authorization at any point. And then it lets them know that they can either pay via ACH or via credit card. They just go to get started. They would just click to agree to these. So if there was a transaction limit, expiration date, those would be in there. In this example, I don't have that. They just go to next step, how they're going to pay that so they can pay by card with the 2.99% fee clearly marked, or they can pay via ACH with their bank completely for free. So that is just on the setting up a customer for that payment authorization request, which might sounds like it may be helpful for you if you're not doing that today.
Hardy Butler: So that's, this is only on the plus plan though, right?
Colton O'Farrell: This payment authorization is only on the plus plan, correct?
Hardy Butler: So, yeah, let's let me tell you what motivated this initially for me. So in addition to all the other stuff we do, we own some, we own some rental, some commercial rental property, and I've got one particular LLC where we only have two tenants. And one of them has said, yeah, we'll pay electronically, but you need to initiate the pull on your end. And they don't have a way to do that currently. So in that case, I could, since it's so low volume, that doesn't make sense to pay $35 per month because that's- Correct. But I could go on the free plan core. And even though I can't do a payment authorization, I can at least, I can still send them an invoice, right? and the invoice would have a payment link and they could pay electronically.
Colton O'Farrell: I'll walk you through that workflow as well, just so you can see that. So like I mentioned before, if you are connected with QuickBooks, so you just go to the integrations here, you click link QuickBooks account. We do have some automation that you can set up as well. So I have a screenshot here I will show. So once you're connected to a QuickBooks account, it lists your company, it lists your number there. You can change the QuickBooks connection if you need to. We also have this toggleable automation feature that would, once enabled, anytime an invoice is sent from, or is created within QuickBooks, it would automatically be sent via email or phone, SMS to your customer to pay either via credit card or ACH, and I'll walk you through that. But if you have that toggled on, anytime an invoice is created in QuickBooks, it's just gonna be sent automatically via Nickel. Where it's not good to do that is if you have to modify or edit that invoice after it's been created, or if multiple people are having to review, 'Cause each time there's a change, your customer would get an email on that. So in that circumstance, we would recommend having that off. But I'll walk you through the workflow of, so we're connected with QuickBooks in this example. All of our invoices are brought in right here. You just go to the right-hand side, payment request to send that off. So if you hit request payment, you can either send that via email or via SMS. So what we'll do is we'll send this secured payment link. So this is protected via encryption and tokenization. this is the plus feature as well. If you do have a charge them on file with the payment authorization, you can do that as well there. But if you're gonna go ahead and generate your own invoice, you don't need to do this with the nickel. You can continue doing it from QuickBooks. But if you wanted to generate an invoice through nickel, this is how you do it. So we'll just call this 136. 2-3-5. We'll have this be for $5,000 one time, but we also can set up recurring. You can set that up to be every month, week, quarter or year. We'll just set this up as one time, like I mentioned.
Hardy Butler: Is the recurring feature available in the free in the core plan?
Colton O'Farrell: That is only available in Nickel Plus. So scheduling and recurring is kind of one of the main caveats there.
Hardy Butler: Okay.
Colton O'Farrell: So like I mentioned, if it's connected with QuickBooks, all of your attachments, invoices will be brought over. Since we're generating this ourself, we're gonna just go ahead and attach that like so. So I'm gonna go ahead and create this. Send.
Hardy Butler: Oops.
Colton O'Farrell: Add myself.
Hardy Butler: Awesome.
Colton O'Farrell: So that will be sent in real time while that's sending, I'm gonna go ahead and quickly just show you the credit card surcharge management. that we mentioned earlier. So like I mentioned, by default, 100% of the surcharge is going to be paid for by your customer. So this is a global rule. You are able to adjust this at any percentage you like. So if you want to do 50-50, 25-75, or fully eat the costs, you do have that control. I'm going to go ahead and go back to the invoice screen here. So like I mentioned, you can actually go on an individual invoice level and override those global rules. So you just go to settings here. If you wanted to disable credit card payments, you could turn that on. If you wanted to customize, this last option here is where you would override that global rule. So for example, the rule is 100% of the customer pay that credit card surcharge if that's how they want to pay. But for this particular example, we could say we're going to split that with them 50/50 and that would override the global settings just for this particular invoice. But what does it look like?
Hardy Butler: What are the availability of those features, Core versus Plus?
Colton O'Farrell: So that's all available in Core. The only things that are unavailable are the payment authorization requests, scheduling of payments in advance, and then recurring payments.
Hardy Butler: Okay.
Colton O'Farrell: But what that email looks like that your customer will receive is right here. So you'll have your name and logo right there. You have a new payment request, same information that we had seen as I was creating it, invoice attached, They reply to the email, they'll be CC'd on any communication there, and all they simply have to do is hit pay now. They'll be prompted to this screen here where they can pay by card with the 2.99% fee clearly marked, or they can pay via ACH with their bank completely for free.
Hardy Butler: And no requirement on their side to create an account. They just see this. Okay.
Colton O'Farrell: Yes, exactly. And then one other thing I wanted to show you that I think might be helpful. is within the same screen here. So like I mentioned, we give all companies access to their own like payment portal or merchant link. So all individual invoices are have their own secured payment link. So we're doing one to one reconciliation, treating them as their own atomic unit versus like doing a bunch of batch processing. I did want to point out that you can send multiple these at one time if you'd like. So you can send multiple payment requests. Just go right here, could shoot all those off at once. But regarding that payment portal, so that's right here. This serves as typically a one-stop shop for customers to make a payment or as a backup method if the primary method is not working. But this is completely customizable even on the free plan. So you just go into the settings, you could adjust the banner, you know, information there. The only thing we can't do on the free plan is give you a custom URL or domain that's only available on Plus. But if you want that, we're happy to build that out for you. But what this would look like is just like so this will be a lot of our customers embed this in their own website. And so a customer could come in here, click make a payment, they could pay with their card like so, or they could pay via ACH. And this is helpful for some customers, others they just prefer to work directly through invoices. But I would say the vast majority of our customers will take this link and embed it in their website.
Hardy Butler: All right, so can you, I didn't see in the settings, can you.
Colton O'Farrell: Set.
Hardy Butler: It so that it's coming from a specific email regardless of who the user is that's initiating the payment, the invoice?
Colton O'Farrell: Unfortunately, it has to be sent from this receipts at Nickel payments because of deliverability. So we have extremely high deliverability with this. If we were to do custom for each customer, that would severely impact the deliverability. And if your customers can't pay you if they're not receiving the email.
Hardy Butler: That'S fine. I just want to make sure, like, for example, if I don't want it to come from me or from one of my team members, I want it to come from a more generic email address. Right. Okay. All right. So, so in the example I gave you, we're actually still using QuickBooks desktop because it just makes the, for these real estate entities, the transaction volume is so low, it makes no sense to pay QuickBooks online to do. rent cam all that stuff.
Colton O'Farrell: So for your CPA practice, I also didn't get this information earlier. I, you mentioned you had like 14 employees. You have about 100, 150-ish customers that you're working with on kind of a continuous basis. What are you guys doing in terms of annual revenue? This, this doesn't impact pricing, but it's just helpful for us to know internally. Curious what, what you guys are.
Hardy Butler: A million bucks.
Colton O'Farrell: Above a million.
Hardy Butler: Yep.
Colton O'Farrell: And then for the rental properties, so is it just one or two LLCs that you have for that or?
Hardy Butler: Yeah, it's like three, we probably have three or four different entities that have the different properties.
Colton O'Farrell: The only thing with that side of it is we would require each of those entities to have their own separate account. We can't have multiple company accounts on one, but for those rental entities, you would absolutely be able to, it sounds like, use that free version to meet your needs, especially if you only have like two clients with one of the properties. But in then revenue for those I would imagine are, it's quite a lot less than what you guys are doing from the CPA aspect.
Hardy Butler: Individually, yes, on a combined basis, not necessarily, but yeah.
Colton O'Farrell: Okay. That's helpful to know.
Hardy Butler: But where I was going with that question is we still use QuickBooks Desktop, as I said, so I can just use Nickel to create a an invoice, again, I don't, the invoice format, all that for this particular instance, we'll get back to my firm because I still want to talk about that. But for this particular instance, I just basically want to send the tenants a link or that email that you showed me that they can pay. I don't need it to be integrated to QuickBooks or anything like that. I just want a way to process payment that's doable. Yeah.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, absolutely. Okay. And that's just, so that's just for the rental properties QuickBooks
Hardy Butler: desktop. Yeah, just for those. Okay, gotcha.
Colton O'Farrell: I was gonna say if it was for like, you know, related to the CPA firms, we have plenty of customers who aren't integrated with QuickBooks Desktop, but if, you know, they're doing a lot of volume, we're happy to do kind of a, we'll always upload a CSV file to get those accounts started just to make it easier to get your customers, vendors, everything you need in there. But then generally, if customer wants to have kind of a cadence for getting that information, In nickel, we can schedule that as well.
Hardy Butler: Okay.
Colton O'Farrell: I think for your case, it probably is pretty minimal effort required to send out these rental links.
Hardy Butler: So, I mean, truthfully for me, that is likely to be just a test case where I use it to learn about nickel, test nickel, and I might even start using nickel for my firm invoicing, for example. as a test case. But I think you may have touched on this, but this is going to be, this is super important.
Colton O'Farrell: Okay.
Hardy Butler: If we were to put our clients on nickel, we really are going to have to have a separate nickel login for every single client from my firm.
Colton O'Farrell: No, we do have an accounting firm view as well. I don't have that in my demo. So this demo here is just for, like, individual business, but when you're registering as a like Nickel user, it will say like, are you registering as a business or are you registering as accounting firm? And you will have different like viewing privileges from the accounting firm side of things.
Hardy Butler: But I would have one login to Nickel and I could choose from a drop down as to which one of my clients Nickel accounts I would give.
Colton O'Farrell: Exactly.
Hardy Butler: Yep. Okay. Because I thought you said separate logins and that would be a deal killer. We just couldn't.
Colton O'Farrell: No, no, sorry about that. Yeah. The demo account that I'm showing you is more just business owner related. You can set up just as like an account accounting firm. So when you're going through the signup process, it'll either say business owner, accounting firm, and then if you're an accounting firm, you'll have those, like, view privileges for your customers and can drop down and select them.
Hardy Butler: So if I create, let's say that I'm the firm administrator, can I invite members of my firm to create a nickel? What I'm trying to, you know how QuickBooks Online works, right? And a lot of the other similar software packages that integrate. You create sort of a firm account. And then me, if I'm the administrator of the firm, I can invite members of my firm to fall under that account. And then I can allocate access to different clients within that software package. Is that what we would do here?
Colton O'Farrell: Exactly the same. Yeah, we have, I mean, a lot of what we built is designed to mimic like QuickBooks in the fields and the workflows. 98% of our customers are using that. So you will see very similar like fields and workflows through Nickel as well with that.
Hardy Butler: And so if I, how many users does that take up if we do that? Like if I, if I have access to a client and two other members of my team have access to a client, does that take up three or does that just take up one?
Colton O'Farrell: It depends what privileges they are. If they're an administrator, if they're a manager or if they're a member. So if they're a manager or administrator, that takes up a seat, but if they're just a member, it does not. And that again is with the view only privileges.
Hardy Butler: Okay, so they got view only without taking up a seat, but in order to actually process transactions or anything like that. Yes, exactly. Okay. And from a firm perspective, if I were to start testing Nickel, I would want to turn on the integration with QuickBooks Online, of course. But then I assume that I could selectively, I wouldn't want to turn on all my customer, all my clients at once.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, a lot of times we recommend doing a soft rollout to you, just kind of getting your feet wet, testing it out with some of your most enjoyable to work with customers, most loyal customers who will adopt a solution like this. That's typically what we'd recommend. to do a soft rollout. There's a lot of people, though, that have experience with like build.com, Melio, and they hate what they're having place today. And they're like, let's just rock and roll. You're also able to do that. My role really here is just to answer your questions, equip you with everything that you need in order to make the best decision for your business. And my follow up email, I'll send you. So I didn't touch on this too much here, but I have some resources that I will be sending you after the call. I, of course, need to just get that pitch deck potentially or whatever the co-founders have been working on in terms of the series A, but in addition to that, have some resources. So we have our security and data privacy page here that I'll also link with you. But basically what this lets customers know is that we're SOC 2 compliant. All their information is protected. We handle the PCI compliance. We're using encryption and tokenization and those secured payment links to protect accounts. Really, when it comes to fraud protection, Nickel is the one who is on the hook. So customers who utilize us, we have our own secured processes in place and like bank level security that if anyone were to be hit by fraud, it would be Nickel before it would ever be any of our customers with the way that the safeguards are put in place. So there's no money ever living in Nickel, of course. But as we're handling your funds, it's all in FDIC insured accounts. Your funds are always yours. And yeah, like I mentioned, let me.
Hardy Butler: Go back to where I was headed with this. The question is, can I selectively sync invoices? Because for example, if I generate 150 invoices every month, I don't want them all sinking over if I'm doing a soft launch with Nickel. I just want certain ones going over because I don't want to dump 150 invoices in a Nickel and then have to pick.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, absolutely. What I would recommend, so you wouldn't have the automation for that, what you would do, Let me just get back to main page here. So what I would recommend you do in that case then is you would just come into the get paid section here. You'd go to new invoice yourself. You would download the invoice from QuickBooks Online. You'd add your customer name in here that you're going to send that to. And you would just attach the invoice here, generate it through Nickel to send it to your customer via SMS or via email to test it out. That would be my recommendation for at least kind of playing and getting familiar with the solution.
Hardy Butler: All right, but if I wanted to say take 10 of our clients and integrate them directly with QuickBooks, so I didn't have to do this manual process.
Colton O'Farrell: There'S no way to currently do that, right? We, if you have the integration, it would bring all of your customers, your invoices over. I can talk with the team and see if there's any potential solutions for that, but generally, if you're integrating and bringing everything, doing the integration, it's going to bring everything over. that's going to bring it over in real time. Whatever's done in Nickel will reflect in QuickBooks Online and vice versa. So if you want to do kind of the soft launch and testing it.
Hardy Butler: Out, this would be the workflow that I'd recommend. Yep. All right. But in a steady state, if we're completely converted to Nickel, they would all come over. But then I could, looking at the check boxes on the left in the list, I could select which ones I actually want to send via Nickel. Yep. okay. All right. I know we're going over and I appreciate your time, but.
Colton O'Farrell: No, no, it's okay. I do have a. About a minute 20 before this Zoom automatically kicks me off. So I'm happy to, like I said, I'll send those resources in the follow-up email once we get off the call here. But Hardy, just curious, like, based off our conversation, what you've seen today, sounds.
Hardy Butler: Like there's some interest in testing out nickel. But,
Colton O'Farrell: yeah, I'm curious to hear
Hardy Butler: your overall thoughts. Yeah. So real quick in a minute, I like what I've seen. It looks good, I think. You've only been around for two years. I think you've got some things you could do to optimize, which is not a criticism. It's an opportunity. Absolutely. I probably will go ahead and set this up on a test case for our real estate entity, see how it works. You just need to link a payment.
Colton O'Farrell: Method, by the way. So create the account. Once you link the payment method, then you're good to go. There's a lot of people who missed.
Hardy Butler: The payment method step, so just wanted to point that out. But, okay. I would like for you to go through this same demo with one of the members of my team.
Colton O'Farrell: I do have a recorded video I'll share with you that is covering everything that I just walked you through as well that I'll share with you too.
Hardy Butler: Okay. Yeah, I'll send that to him, but he probably want to get on a call and ask his own questions.
Colton O'Farrell: Yeah, if he wants to do that, I'm happy to. But I'll send that demo and he can let me know if he has any questions beyond that.
Hardy Butler: All right. And then the last question is who are the underlying banks that you're built on.
Colton O'Farrell: So I don't actually know that right off hand. I know we have a couple sponsor banks that we're working with. If it's not information that I, if it's information I.
