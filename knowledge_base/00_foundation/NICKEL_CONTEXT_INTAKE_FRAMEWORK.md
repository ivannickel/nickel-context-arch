# Nickel Context Intake Framework

**Purpose:** This framework structures the intake of Nickel's internal context to validate our emergent patterns, identify gaps, and prioritize remaining transcript processing.

**Current State:** 5 of 165 transcripts processed (3%), 69 patterns discovered, 72/100 stability score

## 1. ICP & Target Persona Validation

### Questions for Nickel

**Primary ICP Definition:**
- What is your formal ICP definition (company size, revenue, industry)?
- What segments are you actively pursuing vs. opportunistic?
- How do you prioritize different buyer personas?

**Persona Validation:**
- Do you have existing persona documentation?
- Are accounting firms a strategic target? (We discovered 150-client multiplier)
- HOA/property management focus?
- Construction industry priority?

**Discovered Personas to Validate:**
1. **Accounting Firm Buyer** (HIGH VALUE - 150x multiplier)
   - Validation: Is this a strategic segment or outlier?
   - Context needed: TAM size, sales motion, existing traction

2. **Boutique Renovation Contractor** (Confirmed)
   - Validation: Is construction/contracting core ICP?
   - Context needed: Ideal project size, revenue range

3. **HOA Operations Manager** (Large scale)
   - Validation: Are large HOAs a target segment?
   - Context needed: Minimum homeowner count, use case priority

4. **Fortune 500 Vendor** (Small vendor to large buyers)
   - Validation: Is this a viable segment given volume challenges?
   - Context needed: How to serve without $2M volume?

### What This Will Tell Us

âœ… **If validated:** Prioritize transcripts with these personas
âœ… **If not target:** Deprioritize or categorize as opportunistic
âœ… **New personas revealed:** Add to extraction criteria for remaining transcripts

## Integration Plan: Post-Meeting Workflow

### Step 1: Validate Foundation (Day 1, 2 hours)
```
For each discovered pattern:
â”œâ”€ Check if Nickel validates it
â”œâ”€ Mark as "strategic" / "opportunistic" / "outlier"
â”œâ”€ Update taxonomy confidence levels
â””â”€ Flag patterns that contradict their strategy
```

### Step 2: Create Foundation Documents (Day 2, 3 hours)
```
00_foundation/
â”œâ”€ icp_definition.md              (From their docs + our patterns)
â”œâ”€ positioning_strategy.md        (Their messaging + field reality)
â”œâ”€ competitive_intelligence.md    (Merge their battle cards + our findings)
â”œâ”€ sales_playbook_comparison.md  (Prescribed vs. observed handling)
â””â”€ product_roadmap_context.md    (Roadmap + customer requests)
```

### Step 3: Prioritize Remaining Transcripts (Day 3, 1 hour)
```
HIGH PRIORITY (Process next):
â”œâ”€ Accounting firm buyers (validate strategic persona)
â”œâ”€ Relay Financial mentions (competitive intelligence)
â”œâ”€ Compliance/onboarding issues (operational fixes)
â””â”€ Target ICP matches (confirmed strategic segments)

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
â”œâ”€ Additional personas to validate (2-3 examples each)
â”œâ”€ Objection handling scenarios (learn from outcomes)
â””â”€ Use case variations (edge cases, unique needs)

LOW PRIORITY (Defer):
â”œâ”€ Outlier personas (not strategic)
â”œâ”€ Non-target industries
â””â”€ Disqualified deals (unless learning value)
```

### Step 4: Adjust Extraction Criteria (Day 3, 1 hour)
```
Update agent prompts with:
â”œâ”€ Validated ICP criteria (focus extraction)
â”œâ”€ Strategic pain points (emphasize in analysis)
â”œâ”€ Competitive scenarios (deep dive on wins/losses)
â””â”€ Product gaps (connect to roadmap priorities)
```

## Success Criteria

**Context intake is successful if:**

âœ… We can definitively say which of our 69 patterns are strategic vs. opportunistic
âœ… We have clear prioritization for remaining 160 transcripts
âœ… We understand gaps between Nickel's strategy and field execution
âœ… We can connect product roadmap to customer requests in transcripts
âœ… We have foundation documents populated with their internal context

**Red flags to watch for:**

ðŸš© Our patterns heavily contradict their strategy (suggests we're analyzing wrong segment)
ðŸš© They have no documentation on key areas (ICP, personas, competitive intel)
ðŸš© Their messaging doesn't match what's working in transcripts (positioning gap)
ðŸš© They're unaware of critical issues we found (compliance, competitive threats)
