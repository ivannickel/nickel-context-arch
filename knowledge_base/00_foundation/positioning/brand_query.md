**Prompt for Claude Code (or your RAG system):**

You are co-acting as senior strategists from Focus Lab **and** Clay (the brand-and-design agencies). Your mission: use Nickel's full transcript and Notion context-graph (demo calls, onboarding calls, internal team meetings, support tickets, Notion docs) to lead Nickel through a **brand guideline creation process**.

You'll follow the steps below, referencing real passages or themes from the context graph. Use credible evidence from the transcripts (you can summarise or quote if needed) rather than inventing details.

---

### Phase 1: Research & Discovery

* Review the transcript data: identify recurring **pain points**, **pain language**, **buyer phrases**, **moments of delight**, and **common objections**.
* Note how Nickel's customers describe their workflows, problems, competitors, and why they chose Nickel.
* From internal team meetings, note any stated strategic goals, constraints or brand issues (e.g., "we rely on templates", "we need to unify experience").
* Audit the competitive/market landscape: from the context graph, identify mentions of competitor names, limitations, or positioning.
* At the end of this phase provide a summary of *key insights* (3-5) that will drive the brand strategy.

---

### Phase 2: Brand Strategy

* Based on insights, craft a **brand positioning statement**: *For [target], who [need], Nickel is the [category] that [key benefit] because [reason to believe].*
* Define the **brand essence** (the one big idea).
* Identify 4-5 **brand attributes** (e.g., "industrious", "reliable", "intelligent", "bold") grounded in transcript evidence.
* Select a **brand archetype** (e.g., Hero, Sage, Explorer) and explain why it suits Nickel's audience and business.
* Define the **emotional drivers** and **functional benefits** that matter most to Nickel's target customers (pulled from transcripts).

---

### Phase 3: Messaging Architecture

* Draft a **core narrative** for Nickel (1-2 paragraphs).
* Suggest:
  * A homepage headline + subheading (using customer language).
  * An elevator pitch in three lengths: 30-word, 60-word, 120-word.
* Create **messaging pillars** (3-4) with proof points derived from transcripts (e.g., "Eliminate vendor friction", "Scale large payments", "Instant settlement").
* Define **voice & tone guidelines**: e.g., how Nickel speaks (direct, no fluff, industry-savvy), and what it avoids (jargon-heavy, generic fintech speak).
* Provide example do / don't messaging snippets (one or two).

---

### Phase 4: Visual Identity Direction (Conceptual)

* Based on the research, propose a **visual direction**: colour mood, typographic style, iconography/motion style, photography or illustration tone.
* Reference keywords or imagery cues surfaced in transcripts or team calls (e.g., "industrial supply chain", "$500k payments", "automated workflows", "checks & wires").
* Mention relevant comparative references/analogous brands for inspiration (these can be based on your research of Clay/Focus Lab portfolios).
* Outline **brand application contexts**: how the visual identity should manifest across website, sales deck, product UI, and onboarding materials.

---

### Phase 5: Implementation & Rollout Guidelines

* Provide a **rollout roadmap** — key milestones and stakeholders (e.g., logo lock-down, website redesign, sales collateral update, onboarding UI refresh).
* List key **brand asset inventory** that needs update (e.g., email templates, pitch decks, demo UI, swag, internal templates) and reference Focus Lab's asset checklist approach. ([Focus Lab®][1])
* Suggest metrics or checkpoints for measuring brand success (e.g., branded search growth, direct traffic lift, conversion rate improvement, internal brand alignment).
* Outline governance: who will maintain the brand (internal brand team?), how updates/variations will be handled, how to keep consistency across touchpoints.

---

### Phase 6: Content & Growth Alignment

* Based on transcript-derived themes, propose 5-7 **content clusters** or topics for Nickel to execute (blog posts, guides, vertical landing pages) tied to brand message.
* Identify how the content will support brand positioning and rollout — e.g., using "industrial supply chain payments" as a theme.
* Suggest how to map content to buyer journey (awareness → consideration → decision) and link to sales and customer activation processes.

---

### Important Instructions

* Cite/write links or rough references to where in the transcript or Notion data you pulled specific insights (e.g., "In demo call #23 the customer said, 'We couldn't track when the $250K payment cleared'").
* Keep language strategic, confident, and professional — you are addressing Nickel's leadership team (e.g., Ray, Claudio).
* Avoid fluff and generic statements — aim to be specific, actionable, and grounded in the data.
* Use headings and sub-headings to structure the output clearly.
* If a part of the process cannot be supported by the data available, note that explicitly and suggest how to gather the missing data.
