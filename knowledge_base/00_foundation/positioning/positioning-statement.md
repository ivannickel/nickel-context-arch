# Positioning Statement

**Status:** Baseline (from raw_context, awaiting transcript validation)
**Confidence:** 6.8/10
**Sources:** 2 raw_context documents

## Core Positioning Statement

[VERIFIED: Nickel core positioning statement.md:32-38] Nickel's positioning follows a structured "for/who/providing/unlike" framework:

**Nickel is for…**
> owners and finance managers at building supply companies with 2 to 100 employees

**who have to…**
> let customers buy materials on net terms and manually make credit decisions, manage lien rights and collect payments

**We are…**
> the first all-in-one Supplier Finance platform

**providing the only way to…**
> seamlessly extend payment terms, protect payment rights and collect receivables using one automated solution

**unlike…**
1. industry-agnostic software solutions that are designed for bigger companies in other industries
2. sketchy lenders who charge high rates and create a ton of friction between suppliers and their customers

## Target Customer Definition

[VERIFIED: Nickel core positioning statement.md:32]
- **Title:** Owners and finance managers

- **Size:** 2 to 100 employees

**Problem State:**
[VERIFIED: Nickel core positioning statement.md:34]

## Competitive Differentiation

### Differentiation Axis #1: Industry-Specific vs. Industry-Agnostic

[VERIFIED: Nickel core positioning statement.md:37]
> "unlike industry-agnostic software solutions that are designed for bigger companies in other industries"

**Key Points:**
- Nickel is **building supply-specific** (not horizontal)
- Designed for **SMBs** (2-100 employees), not enterprise
- **Construction/materials workflows** baked into product

**Implied Competitors:**
- Melio (industry-agnostic AR automation)
- Bill.com (enterprise-focused, multi-industry)

---

### Differentiation Axis #2: Supplier-Friendly vs. Sketchy Lenders

[VERIFIED: Nickel core positioning statement.md:38]
> "unlike sketchy lenders who charge high rates and create a ton of friction between suppliers and their customers"

**Key Points:**
- **Transparent pricing** (vs. hidden fees, high rates)
- **Frictionless for end customers** (no supplier-buyer relationship damage)
- **Partner, not predator** (enabling growth, not extracting value)

**Implied Competitors:**
- Invoice factoring companies (nFusion, CapitalPlus, Riviera Finance)
- Startup factorers (Fundbox, AltLine, Billd, SlopePay, ResolvePay)

---

## Transcript Validation

**Validation signals:** (will be added as transcripts process)
- [ ] **Language matching:** Do customers use similar language ("supplier finance", "all-in-one", "automated solution")?
- [ ] **Problem resonance:** How often do transcripts mention manual credit decisions, lien rights, collections?
- [ ] **Competitive positioning:** Are Melio/Bill.com mentioned as "industry-agnostic" pain points?
- [ ] **Differentiation validation:** Do "sketchy lenders" or "high fees" come up as objections to factoring?
- [ ] **Category creation:** Is "Supplier Finance" resonating, or do customers think of Nickel differently?

**Status progression:**
- baseline → validating (after 1st transcript validates positioning language)
- validating → validated (after 2nd+ transcripts show positioning resonance)
- validated → canonical (after 5th+ transcripts confirm differentiation is meaningful)

**Expected evolution:**
- Positioning language may be refined based on customer feedback and language patterns
- Differentiation axes may shift if competitors evolve (e.g., Melio launches building supply features)
- Category definition may be adjusted if "Supplier Finance" doesn't resonate
- Target customer definition may expand beyond 2-100 employees based on actual wins
