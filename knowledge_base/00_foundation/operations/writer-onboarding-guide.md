## 1. About Nickel

### What We Are

Nickel is a **B2B payment platform** that enables small to mid-sized businesses to send and receive payments via **free ACH**, credit card, and check — with **seamless QuickBooks integration**.

**Core Product:** AR/AP automation platform with free unlimited ACH payments, credit card processing (2.99%), and real-time QuickBooks sync.

**In One Sentence:** Nickel helps B2B businesses collect customer payments and pay vendors without the high fees, complexity, or broken promises of competitors like Bill.com and Melio.

### Our Unique Angle in the Market

[VERIFIED: competitor-profile-bill-com.md:186-187, ach-payment-processing.md:69-71]

**Primary Differentiator:** **Free ACH payments forever** (not a promotional tactic)

**Competitive Context:**
- **QuickBooks Pay:** Charges 1% ACH fee ($800-900/month on $80-90K volume)
- **Bill.com:** Switched from "free ACH" to $0.59/ACH + monthly fees overnight, destroying customer trust
- **Melio:** Removed free ACH tier, implemented paywall
- **Traditional Banks:** Charge $5-15 per ACH transaction

**Customer Quote (Bill.com refugee):**
> "We were with bill.com originally when I signed up with them. It was like, yeah, free transactions. And then like right after I signed up, it was like, oh, well, we're going to charge you $0.59 per ACH. And I was like, well, that's not really what I signed up for." [VERIFIED: 021_ashland-roofing_2025-09-18.md:23]

**Our Promise:** Free ACH is our **founding principle**, not a marketing tactic. We're cash-positive and profitable — we don't need to bait-and-switch.

### Why Customers Switch to Us

**Top 3 Reasons** [VERIFIED: knowledge-graph-index.md, pain_points/]

1. **Payment Processing Fees (98.2% of customers)**
   - Competitor fees consume 5-12% of profit margins
   - Construction businesses with 20-30% margins can't afford 2-3% CC fees
   - Example: $135K annual savings for accounting firm managing 150 clients

2. **QuickBooks Integration Quality (82.5% of customers)**
   - Bill.com uses "clearing account" complexity that customers hate
   - Customer quote: "Multi-step process that never really made sense" [VERIFIED: 032_homes-by-triple-m_2025-09-16]
   - Nickel: Real-time two-way sync, no clearing accounts, 5-6 min initial setup

3. **Pricing Trust Crisis (21.7% mention Bill.com frustration)**
   - Bill.com quote: "overnight they realize they could turn this into a revenue making model...pissed off a lot of customers...went from paying nothing to hundreds or thousands of dollars" [VERIFIED: 008_hardy-butler_2025-07-23.md:56-57]
   - Nickel: Transparent $35-45/mo flat fee, no hidden transaction charges, permanent free ACH

1. **Construction & Trades (15.7% of customers)**
   - General contractors, residential remodeling, roofing
   - $1M-$10M revenue, 20-30% margins
   - Use Procore + QuickBooks
   - Pain: Cash flow constraints, check fraud, CC fees erode 8-12% profit

**Strategic ICP (10/10 strategic fit, needs validation):**
2. **Accounting Firms (4.8% of customers)**
   - 15-50 person firms managing 50-150 client accounts
   - 150x client multiplier potential (1 firm = 150 client accounts)
   - Pain: Platform sprawl across Bill.com/Melio/Brex for different clients
   - Referral conversion: 75-90% (2-3x cold prospects)

**Secondary ICP:**
3. **Manufacturing & Distribution (8.4% of customers)**
4. **Wholesale Distribution**
5. **HVAC, Plumbing, Electrical Contractors**

**Anti-Personas (DO NOT TARGET):**
- High-margin professional services (80-100% margins make fees negligible)
- E-commerce / shopping cart businesses (transaction profile doesn't fit)
- Large enterprises with >10 accounting staff (need ERP, not QB)
- ACH-only AP businesses with no CC revenue potential

## 5. Voice, Tone, and Style Guidelines

### What Our Voice IS

[INFERRED from brand-research-discovery-phase-1.md + competitor analysis]

- **Clear:** No jargon, no fluff, no corporate speak
- **Direct:** Get to the point, say exactly what we mean
- **Pragmatic:** Focus on outcomes, not buzzwords ("Save $6K-$60K/year" not "Revolutionize payments")
- **Trustworthy:** Transparent about business model, pricing, limitations
- **Industry-Savvy:** Understand B2B pain (cash flow, net terms, QuickBooks workflows)

**Brand Attributes (from Phase 1 research):**

- **Reliable** - Free ACH forever, not a bait-and-switch
- **Simple** - Straightforward UI, no clearing account complexity
- **Industrious** - Gets work done, no fluff

---

### What Our Voice IS NOT

- **Corporate:** Avoid "synergy," "leverage," "paradigm shift"
- **Jokey:** Don't make jokes about customer pain (cash flow is serious)
- **Fluffy:** No vague promises ("best-in-class," "world-class" without proof)
- **Jargon-Heavy:** Don't say "optimize cash velocity" — say "get paid faster"
- **Generic Fintech Speak:** Don't sound like every other fintech ("seamless frictionless experience")

---

### Examples: Good vs. Bad Content

**GOOD (Clear, Direct, Pragmatic):**
```
❌ Bill.com charges $0.59 per ACH transaction.
✅ On $80K/month in ACH payments, that's $900/month wasted.

✅ Get paid 3-7 days faster with ACH instead of checks. Free unlimited transactions.

```

**BAD (Corporate, Fluffy, Jargon-Heavy):**
```
❌ "Nickel enables seamless frictionless payments to empower your business transformation."
Why Bad: Vague, corporate, no tangible benefit

❌ "Join the payment revolution and unlock synergies across your AP/AR workflows."
Why Bad: Buzzwords, no customer pain addressed

❌ "Our best-in-class platform leverages cutting-edge technology to optimize cash velocity."
Why Bad: Jargon-heavy, no proof, says nothing concrete
```

---

### Tone Variations by Content Type

## Welcome to the Team

You now have everything you need to write high-converting content for Nickel's ICP. When in doubt:

1. **Use customer language** from the transcripts (copy/paste quotes)
2. **Lead with pain** (fees, net terms, cash flow) before features
3. **Be specific** ($6K-$60K savings, not "save money")
4. **Cite competitors** (Bill.com refugees, QB Pay 1% fee)
5. **Stay transparent** (explain how we make money, no fluff)
