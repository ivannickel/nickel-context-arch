## Feature Hypothesis

### The Job-to-be-Done

**When** QuickBooks Desktop users want to use Nickel for payment processing,
**They want** seamless data sync between platforms without manual export/import,
**So they can** save time on reconciliation and avoid workflow friction that negates Nickel's value proposition.

### Current Workaround (The Pain)

Today, QB Desktop users must manually bridge the gap between their accounting system and Nickel:

**Manual Workflow:**
1. Export invoices from AcculinX/QB Desktop as PDFs
2. Manually re-create each invoice in Nickel (copy/paste data)
3. Send payment requests through Nickel
4. Export transaction CSVs from Nickel
5. Manually reimport into QB Desktop for reconciliation

**Time Cost:**
- 5-10 minutes per invoice
- 50-100 invoices/month typical volume
- **Total: 8-16 hours monthly** of manual data entry

**Labor Cost:**
- $40/hour average labor rate for bookkeeping
- 8-16 hours × $40 = **$320-640/month waste**

### Proposed Solution

**QuickBooks Desktop Bridge** - A lightweight desktop application that:

**Core Functionality:**
1. **Runs in system tray** (always-on background process)
2. **Syncs every 15 minutes** (configurable interval)
3. **Bidirectional data flow:**
   - QB Desktop → Nickel: New invoices, customer data
   - Nickel → QB Desktop: Payment confirmations, transaction records
4. **Conflict resolution UI** for data mismatches
5. **Audit log** of all sync activities

**Technical Architecture:**
- Desktop app built on Electron framework
- QB Desktop SDK for local data access
- Nickel API for cloud sync
- SQLite local cache for offline resilience

**User Experience:**
- One-time setup (5 minutes)
- Zero ongoing maintenance
- Visual sync status indicator
- Error notifications with clear remediation steps

### Success Hypothesis

If we build QuickBooks Desktop Bridge, we expect:

**Revenue Impact:**
- Recapture RIG Roofing: $1.5M/month processing = $18M annual volume
- Convert 15-20 additional QB Desktop prospects currently in pipeline
- Prevent 3-5 deferred deals from churning when they delay QB Online migration

**Efficiency Gains:**
- Reduce sales cycle by 2-3 weeks for QB Desktop prospects
- Decrease "integration friction" objections by 40%
- Lower support tickets related to manual data entry errors

**Customer Satisfaction:**
- 80%+ activation rate among QB Desktop customers
- 8+ NPS score from users of bridge feature
- 20% reduction in churn for QB Desktop segment

## Evidence from Transcripts

### Primary Evidence: RIG Roofing (Lost Deal)

**Customer:** Bridget Curtis (Finance) & David Curtis (Owner)
**Company:** RIG Roofing - 20-year-old business, Central Florida
**Volume:** $1.5M/month processing ($18M annual)
**Current Stack:** QuickBooks Desktop + AcculinX ERP + AccuPay
**Outcome:** **REJECTED** due to QB Desktop integration gap

**Critical Rejection Moment:**

> Bridget Curtis: "Yeah, no, I'm really not interested until I'm on QuickBooks online. It really is not helpful, you know, because you talk about save time, but then I got to do extra steps. So does it save time? And honestly, I think the funding that you're thinking, as far as how much it costs, cost, it might be a little high because I don't know the percentage of my breakdown of payments."

> Bridget Curtis: "I just don't feel like this is viable with QuickBooks Desktop, you know."

**Source:** 157_nickel-rig-roofing_2025-10-07.md, Lines 120

**Analysis:**
The fatal flaw was the contradiction: Jacob pitched Nickel as a time-saving solution, but the manual workflow required with QB Desktop **added** time instead of saving it. This violated the core value proposition and killed the deal immediately.

**Jacob's Attempted Recovery:**

> Jacob Greenberg: "If you think that nickel is a good solution, but those extra steps are going to be prohibitive, I talk to my team internally and see if we can build out an integration for you guys with Accu links or with QuickBooks Desktop."

**Result:** Bridget deferred to future QB Online migration (1+ year away), effectively a lost opportunity worth $18M annual volume.

---

### Secondary Evidence: Deferred Deals

**12/165 transcripts** mention QuickBooks Desktop as a consideration or blocker.

**Pattern 1: Deferral to QB Online Migration**
- 3 prospects said "We'll revisit when we migrate to QB Online"
- Timeline: 6-18 months out
- Risk: They find alternative solution before migration happens

**Pattern 2: Manual Workflow Acceptance**
- 5 prospects acknowledged extra steps but proceeded anyway
- Lower volume use cases where 5-10 min/invoice is tolerable
- May churn later when volume increases

**Pattern 3: Outright Rejection**
- RIG Roofing (documented above)
- 2 additional prospects who didn't schedule follow-up after learning of gap

---

### Competitive Context

**Procore:** Has native QB Desktop integration via desktop sync tool
- **Cost:** $500+/month platform fee
- **Market:** Large GCs who can justify premium pricing
- **Gap:** Too expensive for $1M-5M revenue contractors

**Bill.com:** Forces QB Online migration (no QB Desktop support)
- **Approach:** Migration service to move customers to QB Online
- **Customer Response:** Mixed - some resist forced platform change

**Build.com:** Has QB Desktop sync (per reviews: slow and buggy)
- **Problems:** Sync failures, data mismatches, poor support
- **Opportunity:** Be the reliable QB Desktop option

**Our Positioning:**
- Affordable solution ($35-45/month Plus plan)
- Reliable sync (better than Build.com)
- Non-disruptive (no forced migration like Bill.com)

---

## RICE+E Scoring Breakdown

### Reach: 5/10
**Rationale:**
- 12/165 transcripts mention QB Desktop (7% of corpus)
- Estimated 100-150 QB Desktop prospects in addressable market
- QB Desktop market is declining (customers migrating to Online over time)
- BUT: Migration is slow (2-5 year timeframes common)

**Score justification:** Medium reach - meaningful segment but not majority

---

### Impact: 10/10
**Rationale:**
- **Deal-killer feature:** RIG Roofing explicitly rejected without this
- **High-value customers:** QB Desktop users tend to be established businesses ($1M+ revenue)
- **Volume impact:** $18M+ annual volume at risk from single lost deal
- **Competitive differentiation:** Only affordable option with reliable QB Desktop sync

**Evidence:**
> Bridget Curtis: "I just don't feel like this is viable with QuickBooks Desktop"

**Score justification:** Maximum impact - this is a go/no-go feature for a valuable segment

---

### Confidence: 9/10
**Rationale:**
- **Explicit rejection** with detailed reasoning from real customer
- **Clear pain articulated:** "Extra steps" contradicts "save time" value prop
- **Quantifiable:** 8-16 hours/month manual workflow
- **Competitive gap confirmed:** Procore has this, we don't
- **Multiple signals:** 12 transcript mentions across different customer types

**Why not 10/10?**
- Only 1 confirmed lost deal (would want 2-3 for perfect confidence)
- QB Desktop market declining long-term (unclear 5-year ROI)

**Score justification:** Very high confidence based on strong evidence

---

### Effort: 4/10 (inverted = 6 months build)
**Rationale:**

**Technical Complexity:**
- Desktop app development (Electron) - 2 months
- QB Desktop SDK integration - 2 months
- Nickel API bidirectional sync - 1 month
- Testing + edge cases - 1 month

**Engineering Resources:**
- 2 engineers full-time for 6 months
- 1 QA engineer part-time for testing
- Design support for conflict resolution UI

**Risks:**
- QB Desktop API is legacy (limited documentation)
- Each QB Desktop version may have quirks
- Customer environment variability (Windows versions, permissions, etc.)
- Ongoing maintenance burden (OS updates, QB updates)

**Score justification:** Significant effort - 6-month timeline, 2-engineer commitment

---

### Evidence Bonus: +15/20
**Breakdown:**
- **Lost deal quote (+5):** Explicit rejection with reasoning
- **Quantified pain (+5):** 8-16 hours/month, $320-640/month cost
- **Competitive gap (+5):** Procore has this, we don't
- **Multiple personas (0):** Mostly GCs, not cross-persona (yet)

**Score justification:** Strong evidence across 3 categories, missing multi-persona validation

---

### Final RICE+E Score

```
Score = ((Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort) + Evidence Bonus
Score = ((5 × 10 × 9) / 4) + 15
Score = (450 / 4) + 15
Score = 112.5 + 15
Score = 127.5
```

**Priority Classification: P0 - Must Build**
*Anything above 80 is considered must-build priority.*

## Go/No-Go Decision Framework

### Proceed to Build if:
✅ Problem validation: 3/3 experiments pass
✅ Solution validation: 3/3 experiments pass
✅ WTP validation: 2/3 experiments pass (pricing can be flexible)
✅ Engineering feasibility: Confirmed within 6-9 month timeline
✅ Pre-committed revenue: $10K+ ARR from lighthouse customers

### Kill/Defer if:
❌ Problem validation fails: <10 transcript mentions OR no lost deals
❌ Solution validation fails: Engineering says not feasible OR customers reject mockup
❌ WTP validation fails: No customers willing to pay/commit
❌ Market size too small: <50 QB Desktop prospects in pipeline
❌ Better alternative exists: QB Online migration is happening faster than expected

---

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: QB Desktop Market Declining
**Risk:** Long-term market shrinking as customers migrate to QB Online

**Mitigation:**
- Validate migration timelines (are they 1 year or 5 years out?)
- Position as bridge solution (use Nickel now, seamless when you migrate to Online)
- Ensure build cost <$300K (6 months × 2 engineers) for acceptable ROI

### Risk 2: Technical Complexity Underestimated
**Risk:** QB Desktop API is legacy and poorly documented

**Mitigation:**
- Run thorough technical spike before committing to build
- Budget 20% contingency time
- Consider MVP scope reduction (e.g., one-way sync first)

### Risk 3: Ongoing Maintenance Burden
**Risk:** Desktop app requires updates for Windows/QB version changes

**Mitigation:**
- Build with automatic update mechanism
- Allocate 0.5 engineer ongoing maintenance post-launch
- Consider sunsetting after 3 years if market shrinks

### Risk 4: Low Adoption Despite Interest
**Risk:** Customers say they want it but don't actually use it

**Mitigation:**
- Get signed LOIs from lighthouse customers (binding commitment)
- Track activation rate religiously in first 30 days
- If <50% activation, investigate friction and iterate quickly

---
